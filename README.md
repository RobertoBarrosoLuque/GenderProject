3. [notebook_experiments](notebook_experiments): Contains sub-folders with Jupyter notebooks for each aspect of the project 
    - [Binary Labelling](notebook_experiments/binary_labelling): Jupyter notebook(s) used for the purpose of binary labelling â€“ used Pytorch and LSTM 
    - [Passive Voice](notebook_experiments/passive_voice): Jupyter notebooks used for the purpose of testing, implementing analyzing passive voice instances in GBV-related newspaper articles
    - [Word Embeddings](notebook_experiments/word_embeddings): Jupyter notebooks used for creating and analyzing word embeddings and word2vec models
4. [web_sraping](web_scraping): This folder contains all helper functions used for web-scraping newsppaer articles from top 3 newspapers in each of the following countries: Mexico, UK, Pakistan
