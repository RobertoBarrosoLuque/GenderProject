       "  'title': 'Clinical trial of Covid-19 vaccine completes this week',\n",
       "  'text': 'ISLAMABAD: As over 17,000 out of 18,000 volunteers have been vaccinated, Pakistan is expecting to complete the clinical trial of a Covid-19 vaccine in the current week.\\n\\nWhile critics said the country should have pre-booked the vaccine, some experts are of the opinion that by the end of the first quarter of the year, tens of options will be available for the procurement of vaccine.\\n\\nIn August last year, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) gave a nod to hold the clinical trial of Covid-19 vaccine prepared by the Chinese CanSino company in the country. The trial started in September. In December, it was decided to increase the sample size from 10,000 to 18,000.\\n\\nUniversity of Health Sciences (UHS) Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Javed Akram, who is also member of the Scientific Task Force on Covid-19, said the trial will be completed by the end of the week.\\n\\nDrap approved trial of Chinese vaccine\\n\\n“As the vaccine is double blind which means half of the doses are not active, it will be announced that how many volunteers have contracted virus and what is the efficacy rate. Moreover, follow-up of volunteers will be continued for a year and they will be tested for free in case of symptoms of Covid-19,” he said.\\n\\nReplying to a question, Dr Akram said the process to register the vaccine had already been initiated and that the price of the vaccine will be from three to four dollars. It will be a single dose so people will have to get it only once.\\n\\nDelay in pre-booking of vaccine\\n\\nAs Pakistan is being criticised especially on social media for delaying booking of the vaccine, the Ministry of National Health Services believes that the criticism is unjustified.\\n\\nA senior official of the health ministry, requesting not to be quoted, said Pakistan should not be compared with around 10 countries, including Canada and United States, which have pre-booked the vaccine.\\n\\n“Though it is being said they have pre-booked the vaccine, the fact is these countries have invested in the research and that investment can sink. There are around 180 other countries which have not opted for pre-booking.”\\n\\nOn Dec 30, Pakistan booked 1.1 million doses from China’s state-owned company, Sinopharm.\\n\\n“The vaccine will be registered by Drap in upcoming week and then it will take up to 10 days to get the vaccine and disperse it to the citizens. We have arranged the vaccine for frontline workers and hope that CanSino, which has been conducting clinical trial in Pakistan, will also start its manufacturing soon and we will get the vaccine in the next quarter of the current year. Training of medical staff has already been started to administer the vaccine,” he said.\\n\\nThe official said as COVAX, a global alliance, had already pledged to give 50 million free doses of vaccine to Pakistan so initial supply may also start in the second quarter of the year.\\n\\n“No country in South Asia has pre-booked the vaccine. However, the position of India is bit different as 80 percent of globally required vaccine is prepared there, so it (India) put a condition that some of the vaccine will be given to India. However I believe that within four months there will be around a couple of dozen options due to which the vaccine will become easily available. South Korea has no issue of funding, as compared to Pakistan, but it has decided to wait for two months to get best or most efficient vaccine,” he said.\\n\\nA microbiologist, Prof Dr Javed Usman, told Dawn that it was next to impossible for countries like Pakistan to provide vaccine to all the population at once.\\n\\n“Even United Kingdom has made a priority list in which elderly people and frontline workers have been included. Similarly, in Pakistan it has been decided to vaccinate frontline workers and elderly people. In the next few months, the vaccine will be available in the market so people who can afford it will be able to buy it from the market.

       "  'title': 'If Pakistan can handle Covid, why not polio, wonders IMB',\n",
       "  'text': 'ISLAMABAD: The Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) for Polio has said that if Pakistan could deal with Covid-19 and mobilise resources to check its spread, why can’t the same be achieved in the case of polio.\\n\\nThe board works on behalf of international donor agencies and issues reports on the performance of countries every six months.\\n\\nIn its report released after the board’s 19th online meeting, chaired by IMB Chairman Sir Liam Donaldson last month, it was revealed that from the beginning of 2016 until the time of its meeting in November 2020, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) spent $1.16 billion in Pakistan.\\n\\nBy early December, there had been 82 cases of type-I wild poliovirus and 104 cases of type-II vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDP) in the country.\\n\\nMoreover, the large size of VDP outbreaks in Pakistan and Afghanistan has been declared a threat to other countries, especially the one in Pakistan, because large amounts of type-II vaccine will be deployed.\\n\\nAs a result, the poliovirus could transmit to communities outside the two countries as it had already been detected in sewage in Iran.\\n\\nThe IMB was of the view that Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan and the head of the National Emergency Operations Centre, Dr Rana Safdar, were overburdened as they were dealing with both Covid-19 and polio at the same time.\\n\\nIn November 2012, the IMB recommended travel restrictions on Pakistan that were implemented on May 5, 2014, following which it became mandatory for everyone travelling abroad to get vaccinated.\\n\\nAccording to the report available with Dawn, since March 2020 the IMB had heard impressive accounts of the way in which polio eradication assets had been repurposed and are helping greatly in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\n“Indeed, many people have spoken of a Covid-19 ‘silver lining’; this references the much better joint working of teams, and the dissolution of many organisational and professional boundaries. Specifically, given the rapid mobilisation of the Pakistani government’s response to Covid-19, people have asked: if Pakistan can do it for Covid-19, why can it not do it for polio,” the report stated.\\n\\nCommenting on the special assistant on health, the report said: “As he came to the first meeting of the IMB in his new role, Dr Faisal Sultan made a very strong statement of commitment, both personal as well as professional, and reaffirmed that the country’s government will not be found lacking on polio eradication. He said that this will be demonstrated in a greatly improved performance in the weeks and months ahead.”\\n\\nHowever, it further stated that in late December 2016, the World Health Organisation reported that Pakistan had achieved the lowest number of annual cases ever reported from the fewest number of affected areas of the country.\\n\\nBy that point in 2016, there had been 19 cases of type-I wild poliovirus and two environmental samples positive for type-II VDP (one case emerged later).\\n\\nHowever, by early December in 2020, there were 82 cases of type-I wild poliovirus in Pakistan and 104 cases of type-II VDP, the report revealed.\\n\\nWhile sharing that poliovirus had travelled between countries, it revealed: “Between April and June 2020, there was substantial cross-border, international spread. For example, from Pakistan to Afghanistan; Côte d’Ivoire to Mali; Guinea to Mali; Côte d’Ivoire to Ghana; Ghana back to Côte d’Ivoire; Central African Republic to Cameroon; and Chad to Sudan and also to South Sudan.”\\n\\nA technical expert, requesting not to be named, said the IMB was quite right when it said that there was government’s will to deal with Covid-19 but such sincerity was not shown while combating polio in the last over three decades.\\n\\nNew Covid-19 strain\\n\\nDispelling rumours on social media about the new strain surfacing in Pakistan, National Institute of Health Executive Director Maj Gen Aamer Ikram said people should pay no heed to it.\\n\\n“Though no such case has been reported, people should understand that mutation in ribonucleic acid viruses is normal. We have been doing genetic sequencing of samples of every passenger, coming from the UK, but it needs to be understood that the virus can arrive in Pakistan at any time as its incubation period is around six days and a patient arriving with no symptoms can develop the virus any time,” he said.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) reported 63 deaths and 2,260 cases in a single day on Saturday.\\n\\nAs of Dec 26, total active cases in the country reached 39,177 with 316 patients on ventilators.\\n\\nPublished in Dawn, December 27th, 2020',\n",

Crematoriums across Delhi said they were full up and asked grieving families to wait.\\n\\nHospitals in Delhi have gone to the city's high court this week seeking it to order the state and federal governments to make emergency arrangements for medical supplies, mainly oxygen.\\n\\n“It's a tsunami.

       "  'text': 'PESHAWAR: Buses are parked at Chamkani depot after the BRT service was temporarily closed on Sunday because of a surge in Covid-19 cases here.—Shahbaz Butt / White Star\\n\\n• 118 die of virus, 5,611 more infected • 1m doses reach Pakistan • Expert warns country entering dangerous phase\\n\\nISLAMABAD: With the number of Covid-19 cases hovering over 5,000 for more than a week, all provinces as well as Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) have sought services of the armed forces to get the standard operating procedures (SOPs) enforced.\\n\\nMeanwhile, according to the projected model of the US-based institute, the number of deaths, that has crossed 17,000, would surpass 28,000 by August 1 this year.\\n\\nOn the other hand, one million more doses of Covid-19 vaccine reached Pakistan from China on Sunday.\\n\\nAccording to data of the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), 118 deaths and 5,611 cases were reported in a single day. As of April 25, the number of casualties stood at 17,117 while active cases were recorded at 88,698.\\n\\nOverall 531 ventilators were in use with over 80 per cent occupied in Gujranwala, Multan and Lahore. As many as 5,791 patients were admitted to hospitals across the country.\\n\\nAfter the four provinces and AJK, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad sought the army’s assistance in implementing health guidelines, the interior ministry issued a notification, allowing them to avail services of the forces.\\n\\nThe announcement came from Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed through a video statement, in which he said the federating units could take the services of the Pakistan Army as per their requirements.\\n\\nThe minister said Sindh’s request was not received, but later the provincial government also wrote a letter, requesting assistance from the armed forces.\\n\\n“This is a big decision as the neighbouring country, India, has been reporting 350,000 cases per day. Pakistan Army has always stood by people in the wake of floods, earthquakes and other natural calamities. Therefore, it was decided during the meeting of the National Coordination Committee (NCC) to seek army’s help in getting the SOPs enforced,” he said.\\n\\nAccording to the interior ministry’s notification, the federal government has conferred powers under Article 245 of the Constitution and authorised provinces to deploy sufficient troops with effect from April 25.\\n\\nThe Gilgit-Baltistan Home Department also notified the deployment of the army and Rangers in cities having a positivity rate of more than 5pc. It also banned dining in restaurants and closed all parks in the region.\\n\\nOn April 23, Prime Minister Imran Khan had said he had asked the army to assist the police and law enforcement agencies in enforcing SOPs, warning that Pakistan might soon face a situation similar to India’s if the current trend continued.\\n\\nMeanwhile, after 500,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccine arrived in Islamabad on Saturday, another one million reached Pakistan from China on Sunday.\\n\\nCovid-19 fatalities\\n\\nAccording to a projected model of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which is part of the University of Washington, death toll in Pakistan may reach 28,549 by August 1 if the current trend persisted.\\n\\nThe graph released by the institute has projected the number of casualties at 22,000 by the end of May, 26,000 in June and around 28,000 by the end of July.\\n\\nOn the other hand, public health expert Dr Ziauddin Islam told Dawn that Pakistan was entering a dangerous phase of the pandemic.\\n\\n“There is a need to work on war footing as we are faced with triple burdens. Our healthcare workers have become fatigued, hospital and gas supplies were depleting and the nation is facing financial issues,” he said.\\n\\n“We need to know that if any country in the region controls the pandemic, it [country] will start growing rapidly. China’s GDP has started growing at 23pc and if we control Covid-19, Pakistan can beat India,” Dr Islam said.\\n\\n“We need maximum impact from vaccination to reduce cases, hospitalisation and deaths and also reduce the risk of emergence of more transmissible and deadly variants. A single well-targeted vaccination can save 10 times more lives and prevent 100 times more cases than vaccinating a low-risk person in a low-risk community,” he added.\\n\\nPublished in Dawn, April 26th, 2021',\n",

       "  'title': \"Does plasma therapy treat Covid? Is it safe? Here's all you need to know about the approach\",\n",
       "  'text': 'There are real dangers in the way plasma therapy has been publicised in the media, particularly in Pakistan.\\n\\nThe news every morning is grim. With the number of cases rising exponentially in all countries, the infection rate of Covid-19 (Corona Virus Induced Disease 2019) does not appear to be slowing down. A daily dose of numbers infected in each province with total deaths only adds to the anxiety and uncertainty that has gripped not only our country, but the entire world.\\n\\nWe had been dealing with intermittent outbreaks of polio across the country, had barely recovered from the HIV epidemic in Larkana, and had just about dusted ourselves off (albeit not completely) from a dengue outbreak in Punjab, and here we are now: facing another crisis. Only this time the transmission is unclear, knows no bounds, and it is not quite as simple and easy as spraying your garden to eliminate the vector because it is not a mosquito, it is us.\\n\\nCovid-19 is new and as aptly referred to, novel. We are still trying to understand it. What makes the virus scarier than many other infectious diseases is that no approved medical treatment exists currently. Moreover, there are no vaccines in the market that will prevent humans from acquiring the infection in the first place.\\n\\nIn the absence of these modalities, healthcare professionals have no other choice but to provide supportive care (which simply manages the symptoms of the disease) to patients afflicted with Covid-19.\\n\\nHow does the virus cause disease?\\n\\nThe virulence of a particular virus is often associated with the immune response it encounters in the human body. For Covid-19, the immune response has been divided into two phases. The initial phase is thought to involve the development of a specific adaptive immune response required to eliminate the virus, and stop progression of the disease. Therefore, it becomes important to provide treatments that boost immune responses early in the infection, such as antibodies and immunomodulators.\\n\\nImmune responses however tend to weaken with age, which is why the elderly are particularly vulnerable.\\n\\nIf the immune response is weak or impaired because of other comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, the virus multiplies and can lead to tissue damage. The second phase of the immune response leads to damaged cells inducing inflammation in the lungs.\\n\\nThis is where the infection enters its dangerous phase, since lung inflammation causes life-threatening respiratory disorders, making it difficult for individuals to breathe on their own. Different therapies being tested work at different stages of the disease which is why it is important to identify which phase a patient is in before you initiate treatment.\\n\\nNew therapies\\n\\nIn the face of this pandemic, several new experimental therapies are being proposed and tested by medical researchers, including anti-viral drugs which can kill viruses. Other drugs include immunomodulators that modify the ability of the immune system to fight viruses. Researchers have also looked into medicines used to fight other infections such as the anti-malarial choloroquine, which is thought to help prevent the virus from infecting cells.\\n\\nExperimental therapies\\n\\nMany of the therapies being investigated currently are regarded as \"experimental\" since they have no proven efficacy in fighting off this variant of the coronavirus.\\n\\nExperimental therapies or treatment are not recommended except in the setting of clinical research. Such treatments, under ideal circumstances, should not be provided to the general public until safety and effectiveness has been established through rigorous systematic research.\\n\\nHowever, amidst these desperate times with Covid-19 related deaths increasing every day, the natural inclination is to make use of any novel intervention that provides even the tiniest glimmer of hope.\\n\\nPlasma therapy: What is it and how does it work?\\n\\nOne such intervention that has been the talk of the town is convalescent serum transfusion, commonly referred to as \"plasma therapy\". This treatment modality has previously been used as a desperate last resort step during Ebola outbreaks of 2014, and also in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers).\\n\\nThe procedure of plasma therapy involves collecting blood from someone who has recovered from Covid-19 and transfusing separated plasma to a critically sick patient. Plasma is the clear part of blood that is left when blood cells have been removed and contains antibodies and other proteins. The transfusion of plasma with its antibodies provides a form of \\'passive immunity\\' to the sick recipient to fight the infection. The protection offered by passive immunisation however is short-lived, usually lasting only a few weeks or months.\\n\\nThe science behind plasma therapy and passive immunisation, per se, is not new or novel considering that the concept, introduced by a German immunologist Emil von Behring, has existed since 1890, and has been widely applied for the treatment of different infectious diseases including mumps, measles and polio etc.\\n\\nThe donor of the plasma must have been previously diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and subsequently test negative for Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses, as well as for Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, HIV, and syphilis at the time of donation. The donors must be otherwise healthy for at least 10 days, with a high level of Covid-19 specific antibodies.\\n\\nWill plasma therapy treat Covid-19 patients?\\n\\nWe don’t know. Medical researchers and scientists all over the world are now grappling with this question.\\n\\nExperience from China\\n\\nPreliminary data from China is promising, reporting some positive outcomes of convalescent serum transfusions to desperately sick Covid-19 patients. However, there is no robust evidence to consider this as a \"miracle cure\".\\n\\nThere are multiple reasons for this. First and foremost, one of the studies from China that reported successful outcomes of this experimental therapy involved a small group of critically ill Covid-19 patients. Furthermore, the authors of this research themselves acknowledged several limitations, including the fact that the patients were also on multiple other treatments (including steroids and antiviral agents) and they cannot be sure what helped, given the very small number of patients.\\n\\nOther researchers have also critiqued this investigation, calling it an \"anecdotal case series\". This means that the conclusions from the China experience cannot be generalised since they are inconclusive.\\n\\nPrevious research on plasma transfusions used for diseases other than Covid-19 indicate that this procedure is certainly not risk free, and may lead to side effects in recipients, including but not limited to severe allergic reactions, acute lung injury, and circulatory overload in patients with cardiorespiratory disorders.\\n\\nCurrent situation of plasma therapy\\n\\nPlasma therapy may yield promising results in the future but at this point in time, it is imperative to recognise that we are sailing in unchartered waters. Convalescent serum transfusion is an experimental therapy.\\n\\nPresently, Covid-19 convalescent plasma is either being used as part of a clinical trial (a form of rigorous systematic investigation) or being provided as an Emergency Investigational New Drug (eINDs) to individual patients.\\n\\nThe latter falls within an ethical framework known as Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI). During the 2018 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the World Health Organisation (WHO) established a set of criteria for access to investigational therapies for individual patients outside of clinical trials in emergency, life threatening situations.\\n\\nThe first requirement is that it can be used as MEURI if no other treatment exists. This holds true for Covid-19. Another important criterion includes an approval from a qualified scientific advisory committee. This has been done in the case of United States, where the Food and Drug Regulatory Authority (FDA) has approved the use of this therapy for critically ill patients a couple of days back. Approval from an ethics committee is another essential requirement. Within this context, obtaining informed consent from patients who are provided this experimental therapy is necessary. The patients must know that what they are being offered is an experimental therapy which itself can have significant short-term and long-term side effects. Investigators are of course required to document the results and share them in a timely manner with the wider medical and scientific community.\\n\\nPreliminary reports from MEURI use of plasma will continue to add important information. However, the critical next step is moving to a much more scientific clinical trial design of investigation since this is what is needed to draw conclusive evidence regarding this treatment modality.\\n\\nPlasma therapy in Pakistan\\n\\nThe technology for using plasma therapy exists in Pakistan, but only at a handful of places. Therefore, wider use across the entire country may not be possible.\\n\\nThere is also an assumption that every convalescent patient will be willing to donate. The media glare and the hype created may actually pressurise recently recovered Covid-19 survivors to feel obliged to donate. This is not like any ordinary blood donation and carries its own risks for the donor. This donation involves taking approximately 400 ml of plasma using a procedure called \"apharesis\" in which the donor’s blood is passed through a machine to collect plasma, the plasma is extracted and the blood cells returned.\\n\\nThis process may require the insertion of a wide catheter, called a double lumen line, and can take up to two hours. The side effects may include allergic reactions, fatigue, dizziness and nausea etc. While these side effects are usually mild and stop once the procedure ends, it is important that donors are informed about them.\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, it is important keep public expectations in check. There are real dangers in the way plasma therapy has been publicised in the media, particularly within the context of Pakistan.\\n\\nWhile providing hope in times of despair is essential to boost morale, it is also the ethical responsibility of the scientific and medical community, as well as the media, to provide full information to the general public.\\n\\nRegulation of research\\n\\nPhysician-researchers must adhere to proper protocols as they attempt to use this experimental therapy within Pakistan. This requires scientific approval from a regulatory authority which, in this case, includes Drug Regulatory of Pakistan (Drap) and ethical approval from institutional research ethics committees and the National Bioethics Committee (NBC) of Pakistan.\\n\\nThe NBC is providing rapid turnaround reviews of Covid-19 related research proposals within 72 hours in order to ensure that studies can be initiated as quickly as possible while ensuring safety and welfare of patients. Ethical oversight is always essential when human subjects are part of medical experimentation, and this becomes even more important in times of crises when populations are rendered more vulnerable to possible exploitation.\\n\\nWhen experimental modes of treatment, such as convalescent therapy are being used, patients and family members must be adequately informed of not only the benefits, but also the possible risks/complications that this therapy may entail. It is imperative that patients and their families are not misled in their understanding of participation in research and realise that this is not proven therapy. Such steps ensure greater transparency and help in maintaining public trust.\\n\\nResponsibilities of media\\n\\nMedia has a key role in providing relevant and pertinent information to the public, and not create false hypes by claiming convalescent therapy as a miracle.\\n\\nCaution also needs to be exercised in providing incomplete information to the public without ascertaining all the facts. Research is always done in a certain context. When a researcher reads a research study and looks at the results, she or he will interpret findings based on multiple factors. However, when media accesses the same articles, chasing deadlines, they tend to start putting pieces of the puzzle together that are still missing. The consequence is that an incomplete set of often grossly misleading information is shared with the public.\\n\\nThe pitfalls of doing so were illustrated when the use of the anti-malaria drugs was touted to be a miracle cure for Covid-19 leading to a global shortage for the drug and several fatal and non- fatal toxicity reports.\\n\\nAmidst a growing crisis, with increasing morbidity and mortality, there is a sense of urgency to do whatever it takes. However, we have a responsibility to adhere to established professional and ethical standards, for the safety of the public.\\n\\nScientific research and advancements ought not to be discouraged but in Friar Lawrence\\'s warning to the impulsive Romeo, who represents the voice of reason and caution in Shakespeare\\'s Romeo and Juliet (Act 2, Scene 3), \"Wisely and slowly. They stumble that run fast.\"\\n\\nWe must proceed but wisely so that we do not stumble.\\n\\nOpinions expressed are those of the authors and not necessarily of the institutions they are employed with.',\n",

       "  'text': 'INDIA is in the midst of a cataclysmic Covid-19 nightmare that has unleashed unimaginable suffering on its people. The stats are getting grimmer by the day; after claims earlier in the year that the government had ‘beaten’ the virus with new cases down to 11,000 a day, this week India recorded the world’s highest single-day coronavirus cases at 332,730. The overall death toll at 190,000 is staggering, with 2,624 deaths recorded in 24 hours on Saturday alone. The accounts coming from across the border are truly heartbreaking: there are desperate pleas for oxygen with patients begging doctors for treatment outside emergency wards as others breathe their last; death is occurring in plain sight; makeshift crematoriums are being created in parking lots to deal with the deluge of bodies. With hospitals exceeding their capacity and the collapse of the healthcare infrastructure, doctors across India are exhausted from swimming against an all-consuming current. Thousands are dying a slow death each day due to the lack of oxygen and medication — many of these lives could have been saved had it not been for the deplorable lack of leadership.\\n\\nIndia’s Covid-19 story did not have to be this horror show. But complacency, denial, and an utter disregard for science and data pushed millions into a crippling crisis. As early reports of mutated strains and their high transmissibility surfaced, the Narendra Modi government continued with its grandstanding. Instead of chalking out a plan to vaccinate Indians first, the government was quick to secure deals to export the vaccine. The result is almost too painful to bear: citizens of the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer are dying by the thousands. Meanwhile, superspreader gatherings such as election rallies in West Bengal and the Kumbh Mela were allowed to continue. The role of BJP leaders here has been criminal. Just a month ago, the party encouraged supporters to attend the Kumbh festival, falsely claiming it to be safe. In Uttarakhand, the chief minister went as far as to say that “faith in God will overcome the fear of the virus”. It was only a few days ago that Prime Minister Modi announced the cancellation of pre-election roadshows, when criticism against his government’s handling of the crisis intensified.\\n\\nIt is because of this absence of leadership that India has become a cautionary tale for others in the region. In Pakistan, where Covid-19 cases are climbing at an alarming rate and hospitals in the capital are at capacity, the government appears to be sleepwalking into a similar disaster. Poor vaccine rollout, a creaking healthcare system and blatant disregard for SOPs could spell doom in a matter of weeks. The government’s strategy that it will implement a lockdown only if the system collapses is appalling. If authorities do not reconsider this strategy and act fast, the coming weeks will bring relentless pain and suffering.\\n\\nPublished in Dawn, April 25th, 2021',\n",

       "  'title': 'Why the Covid-19 crisis is an urban crisis',\n",
       "  'text': \"Approximately 60% of Karachi's population lives in informal settlements with limited access to water and sanitation.\\n\\nAs we brace ourselves for the Covid-19 epidemic in Pakistan, we are being told to wash our hands and self-isolate. What if you are unable to do any of these things? According to the Census 2017, Pakistan's population is 207.8 million with an urban share of 75.6 million. The United Nations asserts that in 2015, 45.5% of Pakistan's urban population was living in informal settlements. Thus, an estimated 34 million people in Pakistan live in katchi abadis or urban informal settlements, where water is scarce for the most basic of needs.\\n\\nIn Karachi — a city of over 16 million — approximately 60% of the population lives in informal settlements with limited or no access to clean water and sanitation. Let us compare this — for a moment — with countries being devastated by Covid-19. For example, Italy and Spain, where there is almost universal access to clean water, sanitation, soap and antibacterial gels. Even with their comparatively tiny populations, the virus has spread and killed at a pace no one could imagine. So with northern health systems on the brink of collapse, will the spread of Covid-19 in Pakistan bring urban informal settlements to the frontline of the crisis?\\n\\nThe threat to Pakistan is palpable. As we anxiously await the impact while self-isolating, the voices of the most vulnerable are barely audible. What health threats do the 34 million people living in Pakistan’s informal settlements face? What does this mean for the spread of Covid-19 across the country? How can we leverage data for designing urgent planning interventions that will actually work?\\n\\nAccess to water\\n\\nWhile the instructions for containing the spread of the virus sound fairly simple — wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap multiple times a day — it is not an easy task for the majority of Pakistan's informal settlements that are water deprived. Access to water varies massively. People living in Karachi's Machar Colony, an informal settlement at a considerable distance from the city centre, pay Rs7,000-8,000 a month in water purchased through tankers and other informal means. Residents of Gharibabad, near Karachi's PIDC, spend over Rs5,000 a month on the same. For poor households, this is a very significant portion of their earnings. The idea of using that water repeatedly for washing hands is a luxury. Here are some basic calculations on daily water use for maintaining hygiene:\\n\\nJust for a single month, a household of eight would then require 750 additional gallons of water. This constitutes half of a 1,500 gallon tanker, which costs at least a minimum PKR2,500 in a typical informal settlement. The additional financial cost for basic protection against Covid-19 by washing hands, would then be around PKR1,250 per month for the family. While the figure does not seem very high in isolation, it becomes a critical portion of their income in the absence of earned daily wages amidst the current lockdown. Can a low-income family in an informal settlement even be capable of providing for this additional water expense in times when the same amount would be needed to buy essential food items?\\n\\nCost alone (leaving aside logistical factors such as water availability, transportation, waiting lines) — to perform hand washing as per government recommendations — points to the absolute urgency of making cheap water provision a top priority for informal settlements. Without that intervention, the virus is likely to spread like wildfire, the consequences of which are hard to imagine.\\n\\nSuch a sorry state of our existing water infrastructure is indicative of the larger problem. A 2016 International Development Research Centre (IDRC) report investigated the state of infrastructure in Pakistan's urban informal settlements. It concluded that a drastic overhaul is needed in urban planning and services to enable infrastructural upgrading, especially for public health and access to decent work. Unsanitary environments, in densely populated areas, have devastating a impact on health and livelihoods. For too long the health and social needs of such populations have been invisible. Now — our lives are more interconnected than ever — without addressing their needs, the whole city is at risk.\\n\\nThis brings us to the second recommended measure: social distancing. Let’s look how practical this measure is, using existing spatial and household data.\\n\\nDensity, space, data\\n\\nThe most critical input for tackling urban issues is data. What data sets do we need right now? To phrase it another way: what data-sets — open access and appropriate for secondary analyses by independent researchers or institutions to supplement the meagre data visualisation capacity of all tiers of government — actually exist, for Karachi, and for urban Pakistan?\\n\\nIn Sindh province, the government estimates that there are 1,414 katchi abadis out of which 575 are in Karachi and 408 in Hyderabad. A 2008 World Bank study indicates there are a total 902 katchi abadis in urban Punjab; 65 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 55 in Balochistan and 52 in Islamabad. With these sparse, and potentially out of date figures, we can roughly estimate a total of 2488 informal settlements across Pakistan's major urban centres. This data excludes the numerous goths (approximately 900, as per an Orangi Pilot Project study and the Karachi Strategic Development Plan 2020, that dot Karachi's periphery; areas that are rapidly transforming into peri-urban settlements), with no clear planning regulations, no formal mechanisms for service provisions, often needing to tap into (siphoning) water and other public utilities to survive.\\n\\nIn cities like Karachi, there is a double deficit: data on informal settlements is either not collected regularly, and if it is, it is not disaggregated — especially on social indicators such as health. How can the various tiers of government tackle this crisis through emergency plans if they do not have realistic and up-to-date figures on the number of people living long-term in a ward or district? What about the number and type of built structures they occupy? Their proximity and interaction patterns that could facilitate the spread? The capacity and effectiveness of the infrastructures serving them? Without this data relief planning for Covid-19 becomes a guessing game at best. This provides loopholes in the relief mechanisms — loopholes that can be exploited for populistic provision rather than for where the need is highest.\\n\\nThe most comprehensive and reliable data on demographics in Pakistan is supposed to be gathered by the population census. Yet, reflecting on the methodology adopted for the 2017 census, this crisis demonstrates the ineffectiveness of the data: it collected de jure data on Pakistani citizens, counting them in the wards/districts displayed on their CNICs, and not where they were actually living. Such data quickly becomes irrelevant for subsequent studies, and especially unusable for detailed analysis on the realities of lives and processes in urban Pakistan. Take the Covid-19 crisis: how can governments generate epidemiological models to predict its spread in populations when there is no existing or reliable data about them?\\n\\nBased on work done by the Karachi Urban Lab over 18 months and spanning 13 informal settlements in different districts of Karachi, our findings reveal that people are living on plots as small as 20 square yards. Households have an average family size of eight to nine people, but barely accommodate a single room with a slab for a kitchen and a toilet. In locations where people have expanded vertically, household sizes go as high as 30 people per 80 square yards of plot. These household numbers are higher than the average represented in the 2017 census. The reality is that social distancing is almost impossible to implement in these settings. This kind of population density rings alarm bells for the safety and security of these urban residents and for the spread of Covid-19 across Pakistan. Coupling this constriction of available space for the vast urban majority with a city-wide curfew or extended lockdown hours spells disaster for people forced to confine themselves to tiny, dense, interior spaces. In cases of smaller plots or higher densities the scenario becomes even more unnerving. This, coupled with studies which show that 88% of the housing stock in the city consists of plot sizes 120 square yards or less, lies in strong contrast to people living in houses sized 400-2000 square yards constituting only 2% of the housing stock.\\n\\nHealth and vulnerability\\n\\nDozens of informal settlements in Karachi have been under the threat of eviction for the past 18 months. More than one thousand households have already been rendered homeless in Karachi's District Central. Our ongoing and participatory research with residents, shows that about 40% of households in informal settlements have at least one family member who requires special medical and social care. Adding to the staggering numbers of immunocompromised individuals, there is a diversity of medical, physical and social healthcare needs. About 70% of the persons who need care can be categorised as persons with chronic illnesses who are facing a heightened risk of contracting Covid-19.\\n\\nThe news of Covid-19 — added to eviction anxieties — has created very high levels of psychological stress amongst residents in informal settlements. The distress of managing the food, water and healthcare needs of the family had already reached unprecedented levels but now the lockdown is leading to further disruptions and distress disorders. Psychological research repeatedly shows that stress weakens immunity.\\n\\nWomen and girls are particularly vulnerable to these stressors and their impact. They are most likely to be trapped at home and absorbing significantly higher levels of care work during the lockdown. Levels of violence against women and girls have spiked in the lockdowns in China, the UK and the USA — there are real concerns about the safety and security of women and girls across Pakistan, but especially those in crammed households suffering immense precariousness.\\n\\nThe insecurity, uncertainty, and stress puts residents of informal settlements at high risk of immune-compromisation, compounding their vulnerability to Covid-19. They are at the frontlines of this crisis.\\n\\nLong-term planning\\n\\nThe Covid-19 pandemic should be an urgent wake-up call for urban planners, bureaucrats and policymakers in Pakistan, to invest substantially and meaningfully in understanding and levelling out the highly unequal access to urban infrastructure services. Fragmented governance and lack of accountability at multiple layers of government have hindered inclusive planning efforts for decades. Residents of informal settlements can no longer be invisible to policymakers — as they are a critical part of the functioning of the city, and as some of the most vulnerable people, they deserve due attention.\\n\\nSimply put, the long-term effects of Covid-19 combined with impacts of climate change, will take place in sites and at scales that involve populations which have never been accounted for in previous planning efforts. Here is a list of both urgent and long term recommendations:\\n\\nRestore the local government system across Pakistan. Immediately establish a coordination committee of representatives from provincial/local governments, NGOs and community leaders. Include and account for high numbers of persons with healthcare needs. Document up-to-date numbers and generate spatial data on populations in each ward, with particular emphasis on informal settlements. Prioritise emergency budgets to upgrade existing water infrastructures and include emergency provision of cheap and clean water in informal settlements.\\n\\nThis report has been co-authored by Adam Abdullah, Maheen Arif, Soha Macktoom, Arsam Saleem, Muhammed Toheed, Dr Nausheen H Anwar, Dr Gulnaz Anjum and Dr Amiera Sawas.\\n\\nHeader image: People reach out to get a charity food handout during a lockdown after Pakistan shut all markets, public places and discouraged large gatherings amid an outbreak of the coronavirus disease in Karachi, Pakistan on March 30, 2020. — Reuters\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Post-Intensive Care Syndrome and Covid-19: Crisis after a crisis?',\n",
       "  'text': 'Pics may be the next health crisis that we face when this acute form of Covid-19 crisis settles down a bit.\\n\\nOne thing that didn\\'t make to the spotlight in this Covid-19 pandemic is a question that what happens to the Covid-19 patients after they are discharged from the critical care? A common assumption around the world is that once a patient is discharged from the hospital and is tested negative the problem is resolved. This may be based on a relative lack of information and knowledge, even among the health care professionals, regarding a condition described as Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (Pics).\\n\\nPics may be a next public health crisis that we may face when this acute form of Covid-19 crisis settles down a bit. And it wouldn\\'t be prudent to ignore this serious problem until it becomes another challenge for societies around the world.\\n\\nPics is characterised by conglomeration of symptoms involving physical strength deficits, cognitive decline, and mental health disturbances observed after discharge from critical care that persist for a protracted amount of time.\\n\\nIn the United States alone, approximately 0.8 million people every year suffer from critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation during their stay in critical care and this goes across all age groups. Although, data on this topic hasn\\'t been collected yet in relation to Covid-19 patients, it will be reasonable to assume that this number is going to drastically increase because of the pandemic as at least 20 per cent of Covid-19 patients are reported to require supportive care in critical care units.\\n\\nPatients infected with Covid-19 that are admitted to critical care often need 10 days of supportive care utilising mechanical ventilation. This will result in additional admissions in the intensive care units (ICU) of the hospital for patients who need supportive care.\\n\\nApproximately 50pc of all patients, across all ages, admitted to the ICU requiring mechanical ventilation go on to developing Pics.It is important to note here that the patients who are at risk of developing Pics have a history of associated morbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and prolonged period of mechanical ventilation (because of direct injury to the lungs) that is exactly similar to the clinical profile of Covid-19 patients who are admitted in hospital ICUs.\\n\\nPeople who survive up to two years after discharge from critical care have had to be admitted to a rehabilitation facility or to an ICU again up to the frightening rate of 80pc. This readmission rate is higher in people who have again a similar clinical profile of Covid-19 ICU survivors, such as associated morbidities and acute respiratory distress injuries. Another alarming facet of this problem is long-term cognitive decline. Neurocognitive deficits, including anxiety and depression, were reported in 46 % of patients at one year and 47% of ICU survivors at the two year follow-up.\\n\\nPatients also reported consistent deficits in quality of life at one and two years after discharge with no improvement in emotional, pain and general health over the period of time, rather further deterioration was observed in mental health at two years.\\n\\nChronic pain after critical care persisting over years may be another reason adding to the mental health disturbances of these patients over a period of time.\\n\\nNotably, physical impairment such as balance problems and muscular weakness have also been found in these patients that can potentially increase the risk of falls.\\n\\nEach additional day of bed-rest in critical care is associated with 11pc decrease in muscle strength even at 24 months of follow-up. Muscle weakness is directly associated with deterioration in health related quality of life and physical function throughout and beyond the two years of follow-up in ICU survivors of respiratory illness.\\n\\nOn top of that, there is an alarming impact of Pics on an individual\\'s financial stability. A majority of ICU survivors face some problems returning to work with 31pc of them experiencing major occupational changes, and a quarter of them becoming completely jobless. It doesn\\'t stop here; these patients also develop extreme difficulties in performing their activities of daily living, such as driving a vehicle.\\n\\nIt has been reported that 33pc of individuals even up to a year after discharge from critical care are unable to drive, limiting their mobility and ability to fulfill social responsibilities. These are startling statistics and may be an impending disaster in Covid-19 recovered patients that we are unable to recognise as of now.\\n\\nNow, another question is what can we do about it?\\n\\nThe solution to this problem is developing an integrated rehabilitation response by mobilising our rehabilitation troops and bringing them on the frontline to cater to these complications of stay in critical care.\\n\\nProfessionals such as physical therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, nutritionists and physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians (physiatrists) can work together to develop strategies to treat the complications arising from ICU stay. Exercise programmes tailored towards increasing strength and balance along with good nutrition that may increase functional capacity should start soon after discharge.\\n\\nIt has been previously reported that patients recovering from critical care at hospital had improved physical and psychological outcomes when strengthening exercises were supplemented with amino acids.\\n\\nMany of the patients recovering from ICU may need to be transferred to in-patient rehabilitation settings. However, it poses several challenges such as dire paucity of personal protective equipment which may put rehabilitation professionals at risk. This may result in further spread of disease; healthcare provider carrying Covid-19 asymptotically can become a \\'super spreader\\'.\\n\\nAt the same time, ensuring healthcare providers and staff safety, and greater outreach of rehabilitation services, telerehabilitation and virtual rehabilitation may become the mainstay of providing these services.\\n\\nAlso, conducting multi-national telerehabilitation conferences may help rehabilitation professionals to develop skills to manage these patients in different parts of the world, and give them an opportunity to devise a common framework to address impairments in ICU survivors of Covid-19 patients.\\n\\nWe also see that in many developing countries, the emphasis on rehabilitation is minimal and there are no facilities available there for in-patient rehabilitation. In such situations, there is an increased need to raise awareness that rehabilitation is necessary for Covid-19 patients post-discharge, and that a post-discharge crisis may hit these countries harder due to lack of availability of basic services, such as health and social safety.\\n\\nWith all of this, it is time for global policy leaders such as the United Nations and the World Bank to take Pics and its implications in Covid-19 ICU survivors into account when allocating healthcare relief funds when it comes to developing countries.\\n\\nFurthermore, emphasis on rehabilitation should be integrated as an essential part of support programmes, such as \"Securing Human Investments to Foster Transformation (Shift)\", that are aimed at capacity building of developing countries such as Pakistan to fight this pandemic.\\n\\nLastly, one critical aspect in management of these patients is educating the family members. Pics can have a significant influence on the patients\\' family members. This phenomenon is also known as Pics-family.\\n\\nAfter getting discharged from the hospital, the patient will in most cases be completely dependent on the family, which can play an important role in offering the recovering individual requisite emotional and physical support.\\n\\nThe family should recognise mental health disturbances in patients that may develop on account of anxiety and depression, provide continual emotional support, and help the patient understand the need for physical rehabilitation by engaging them in regular physical activity.\\n\\nPics is a relatively newer term that was introduced almost 10 years ago to healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of patients discharged after critical care to identify the impairments that are usually missed by clinicians, and administer tailored care to address these impairments. This article is an effort to bring this looming yet unrecognised problem to public attention because hospitalisations due to Covid-19 may demand recognition of Pics more than ever, and sooner rather than later.\\n\\nThis article was originally published in Heart & Lung: The Journal of Cardiopulmonary and Acute Care and has been reproduced with permission.',\n",

       "  'title': 'How Covid-19 might increase risk of memory loss and cognitive decline',\n",
       "  'text': 'Of all frightening ways that the virus affects the body, one of the more insidious is the effect of Covid-19 on the brain.\\n\\nOf all frightening ways that the Sars-Cov-2 virus affects the body, one of the more insidious is the effect of Covid-19 on the brain.\\n\\nIt is now clear that many patients suffering from Covid-19 exhibit neurological symptoms, from loss of smell, to delirium, to an increased risk of stroke. There are also longer-lasting consequences for the brain, including myalgic encephalomyelitis /chronic fatigue syndrome and Guillain-Barre syndrome.\\n\\nThese effects may be caused by direct viral infection of brain tissue. But growing evidence suggests additional indirect actions triggered via the virus’s infection of epithelial cells and the cardiovascular system, or through the immune system and inflammation, contribute to lasting neurological changes after Covid-19.\\n\\nI am a neuroscientist specialising in how memories are formed, the role of immune cells in the brain and how memory is persistently disrupted after illness and immune activation. As I survey the emerging scientific literature, my question is: Will there be a Covid-19-related wave of memory deficits, cognitive decline and dementia cases in the future?\\n\\nThe immune system and the brain\\n\\nMany of the symptoms we attribute to an infection are really due to the protective responses of the immune system. A runny nose during a cold is not a direct effect of the virus, but a result of the immune system’s response to the cold virus. This is also true when it comes to feeling sick. The general malaise, tiredness, fever and social withdrawal are caused by activation of specialised immune cells in the brain, called neuroimmune cells, and signals in the brain.\\n\\nThese changes in brain and behaviour, although annoying for our everyday lives, are highly adaptive and immensely beneficial. By resting, you allow the energy-demanding immune response to do its thing. A fever makes the body less hospitable to viruses and increases the efficiency of the immune system. Social withdrawal may help decrease spread of the virus.\\n\\nIn addition to changing behaviour and regulating physiological responses during illness, the specialised immune system in the brain also plays a number of other roles. It has recently become clear that the neuroimmune cells that sit at the connections between brain cells (synapses), which provide energy and minute quantities of inflammatory signals, are essential for normal memory formation.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this also provides a way in which illnesses like Covid-19 can cause both acute neurological symptoms and long-lasting issues in the brain.\\n\\nDuring illness and inflammation, the specialised immune cells in the brain become activated, spewing vast quantities of inflammatory signals, and modifying how they communicate with neurons. For one type of cell, microglia, this means changing shape, withdrawing the spindly arms and becoming blobby, mobile cells that envelop potential pathogens or cell debris in their path. But, in doing so, they also destroy and eat the neuronal connections that are so important for memory storage.\\n\\nAnother type of neuroimmune cell called an astrocyte, typically wraps around the connection between neurons during illness-evoked activation and dumps inflammatory signals on these junctions, effectively preventing the changes in connections between neurons that store memories.\\n\\nBecause Covid-19 involves a massive release of inflammatory signals, the impact of this disease on memory is particularly interesting to me. That is because there are both short-term effects on cognition (delirium), and the potential for long-lasting changes in memory, attention and cognition. There is also an increased risk for cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, during ageing.\\n\\nHow does inflammation exert long-lasting effects on memory?\\n\\nIf activation of neuroimmune cells is limited to the duration of the illness, then how can inflammation cause long-lasting memory deficits or increase the risk of cognitive decline?\\n\\nBoth the brain and the immune system have specifically evolved to change as a consequence of experience, in order to neutralise danger and maximise survival. In the brain, changes in connections between neurons allows us to store memories and rapidly change behaviour to escape threat, or seek food or social opportunities. The immune system has evolved to fine-tune the inflammatory response and antibody production against previously encountered pathogens.\\n\\nYet long-lasting changes in the brain after illness are also closely linked to increased risk for age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease. The disruptive and destructive actions of neuroimmune cells and inflammatory signalling can permanently impair memory. This can occur through permanent damage to the neuronal connections or neurons themselves and also via more subtle changes in how neurons function.\\n\\nThe potential connection between Covid-19 and persistent effects on memory are based on observations of other illnesses. For example, many patients who recover from heart attack or bypass surgery report lasting cognitive deficits that become exaggerated during ageing.\\n\\nAnother major illness with a similar cognitive complications is sepsis – multi-organ dysfunction triggered by inflammation. In animal models of these diseases, we also see impairments of memory, and changes in neuroimmune and neuronal function that persist weeks and months after illness.\\n\\nEven mild inflammation, including chronic stress, are now recognised as risk factors for dementia and cognitive decline during ageing.\\n\\nIn my own laboratory, I and my colleagues have also observed that even without bacterial or viral infection, triggering inflammatory signalling over a short-term period results in long-lasting changes in neuronal function in memory-related brain regions and memory impairments.\\n\\nDoes Covid-19 increase risk for cognitive decline?\\n\\nIt will be many years before we know whether the Covid-19 infection causes an increased risk for cognitive decline or Alzheimer’s disease. But this risk may be decreased or mitigated through prevention and treatment of Covid-19.\\n\\nPrevention and treatment both rely on the ability to decrease the severity and duration of illness and inflammation. Intriguingly, very new research suggests that common vaccines, including the flu shot and pneumonia vaccines, may reduce risk for Alzheimer’s.\\n\\nAdditionally, several emerging treatments for Covid-19 are drugs that suppress excessive immune activation and inflammatory state. Potentially, these treatments will also reduce the impact of inflammation on the brain, and decrease the impact on long-term brain health.\\n\\nCovid-19 will continue to impact health and well-being long after the pandemic is over. As such, it will be critical to continue to assess the effects of Covid-19 illness in vulnerability to later cognitive decline and dementia.\\n\\nIn doing so, researchers will likely gain critical new insight into the role of inflammation across the life-span in age-related cognitive decline. This will aid in the development of more effective strategies for prevention and treatment of these debilitating illnesses.\\n\\nThis article first appeared in The Conversation and has been reproduced with permission.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Can first Covid-19 vaccines bring herd immunity? Experts have doubts',\n",
       "  'text': \"Governments and officials are voicing hopes that Covid-19 vaccines could bring “herd immunity”, with some calculating that immunising just two-thirds of a population could halt the pandemic disease and help protect whole communities or nations.\\n\\nBut the concept comes with caveats and big demands of what vaccines might be capable of preventing. Some experts say such expectations are misplaced.\\n\\nFor a start, figuring out what’s needed to achieve herd immunity with Covid-19 vaccines involves a range of factors, several of which are unknown.\\n\\nWhat is the rate of the spread of the Covid-19-causing virus? Will the first vaccines deployed be able to stop transmission of the virus, or just stop people getting ill? How many people in a population will accept a vaccine? Will vaccines offer the same protection to everyone?\\n\\n“Herd immunity is sometimes wrongly understood as individual protection,” said Josep Jansa, an expert in health emergency preparedness and response at the Stockholm-based European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).\\n\\n“It’s inappropriate to think ‘I will not be affected myself because there is herd immunity’. Herd immunity refers to community protection, not to how an individual is protected.”\\n\\nRead: No one should mistake an effective, fast-tracked Covid vaccine for a universal silver bullet\\n\\nThe ECDC uses an estimated herd immunity threshold of 67 per cent for its models, while Chancellor Angela Merkel said this month that Covid-19 restrictions in Germany could be lifted if 60pc to 70pc of the population acquired immunity, either via a Covid-19 vaccine or through infection.\\n\\nWorld Health Organisation experts have also pointed to a 65-70pc vaccine coverage rate as a way to reach population immunity through vaccination.\\n\\n“The idea of herd community is to protect the vulnerable,” said Eleanor Riley, a professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh. “And the idea behind it is that if, say, 98pc of a population have all been vaccinated, there will be so little virus in the community that the 2pc will be protected. That’s the point of it.”\\n\\nReproduction rate is crucial\\n\\nCentral to the public health calculations on this concept for Covid-19 is the reproduction rate, or R value, of the virus that causes it. This is a measure of how many other people an average infected person passes a pathogen on to in “normal”, or restriction-free, circumstances.\\n\\nAssuming complete vaccine efficacy, herd immunity percentage thresholds for infectious diseases are calculated by dividing 1 by the R value, deducting the result from 1, and multiplying by 100.\\n\\nFor instance, herd immunity from highly contagious measles, with an estimated R value of 12 or higher, will kick in only if 92pc or more within a group are immune. For a seasonal flu strain that could have an R value of 1.3, the threshold would be just 23pc.\\n\\n“The problem is that for now we don’t know exactly how fast the virus spreads without any precautions and with the normal travel and social activities we had a year ago,” said Winfried Pickl, professor of immunology at the Medical University of Vienna.\\n\\nWith so many countries still operating in far from normal circumstances, the assumption should be that the Covid-19 R value would be “closer to 4 than to 2”, he said, since even with semi- or full lockdown measures the R value is around 1.5.\\n\\nAdditionally, anything less than 100pc vaccine efficacy — such as the 90pc or so suggested in early data on the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 shots — would require a matching rise in percentage of coverage to reach herd threshold.\\n\\nAmesh Adalja, a scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said a good target for immunity in the United States would be for more than 70pc of the population to be inoculated, but added that the figure could go up if vaccines are less effective.\\n\\nStop transmission in the 'herd'?\\n\\nExperts say another important factor is whether the Covid-19 vaccines a government chooses to deploy can stop transmission of the virus.\\n\\nEvidence so far suggests the first Covid-19 vaccines to come to market will at least stop people developing the disease. But it cannot be ruled out that people will still catch the Sars-CoV-2 virus and pass it on to others unnoticed.\\n\\n“While protection against illness has a value for an individual, it will not prevent circulation of virus and risk of disease in unvaccinated (people),” said Penny Ward, a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London.\\n\\nBodo Plachter, a professor and deputy director of the Institute of Virology at Germany’s Mainz University teaching hospital, said that respiratory infections in particular can be hard to block completely with vaccines — although the shots will go some way to reducing the amount of circulating virus.\\n\\n“It may well be that vaccinated people will shed fewer viruses,” he said. “But it would be a mistake to assume vaccination alone can suppress a pandemic.”\\n\\nFocus on protecting the vulnerable?\\n\\nEdinburgh’s Riley said this suggests that for now, pursuing an idea of herd immunity through Covid-19 vaccination is fruitless.\\n\\nA better approach, she said, could be to “turn herd immunity on its head”, and use the first limited supplies of vaccines to protect those most in need, without worrying about the more robust members of the “herd” who can live relatively happily with the virus.\\n\\n“Let’s forget about protecting the masses to protect the vulnerable,” she said. “Let’s directly protect the vulnerable.”\",\n",

Some still refuse.”\\n\\nThe hospital is one of a number in Pakistan where phase III trials are underway for Chinese vaccine developer CanSino Biologics\\' Ad5-nCoV candidate.\\n\\nThe government last week announced it had begun the vaccine procurement process, though it has not said whether it will purchase CanSino\\'s candidate or an alternative.\\n\\nWorryingly, a Gallup Pakistan poll conducted last month showed 37 per cent of Pakistanis would not get a vaccine once one became available.\\n\\n\"Given the history of vaccine resistance, this is an alarming number and not just for Pakistan but also for the world, which depends on universal vaccine coverage to control spread,\" Bilal Gilani, the pollster\\'s executive director, said.\\n\\nCountering anti-vaccine sentiments is a worldwide problem, but in Pakistan it is more dangerous than almost anywhere else.\\n\\nDozens of people have been killed in attacks on polio vaccination teams over the years, and the fear and mistrust that spawns such violence has made Pakistan one of two countries, including neighbouring Afghanistan, where the crippling disease has still to be eradicated.\\n\\nSeveral times every year, polio vaccination drives aim to inoculate millions of children, but in some areas they are often met with refusals from parents who believe conspiracy theories about the vaccine.\\n\\nIn more volatile parts of the country, Islamist militancy played a role in attacks on polio immunisation teams, notably after a doctor was accused of running a fake vaccination campaign to help the US Central Intelligence Agency track down Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011.\\n\\nDisbelief\\n\\nYet the dangers of polio have been well known for decades, whereas Covid-19 is a new disease, and authorities have struggled to communicate the urgent need to stamp it out.\\n\\n“Many people still don\\'t believe it is a real disease,” said Tauqeer Hussain Mallhi, an assistant professor at Al-Jawf University, in Sakakah, Saudi Arabia, who studies vaccine effectiveness in Pakistan.\\n\\nA national lockdown was quickly abandoned a few weeks into the virus\\' spread as too many of Pakistan\\'s more than 207 million people were economically vulnerable, and social distancing remained difficult as the public continued to gather in markets and mosques.\\n\\nInfection numbers have continued their morbid ascent with 2,885 new cases and 89 deaths reported on Monday — taking the total infections to over 423,000 and fatalities close to 8,500. Experts say Pakistan is only doing a fraction of the testing it should be doing.\\n\\nCleric Qibla Ayaz, the head of the Council of Islamic Ideology, which advises the government on social and legal issues, said many of the conspiracy theories about Covid-19 are coming from Western countries, spread by social media.\\n\\n“For now, the majority of scholars have said the vaccine and other treatments are important [...] but there are always extremists as there are with polio,” Ayaz told Reuters.\\n\\n“Given the kind of \\'Westphobia\\' we have in Pakistan, it might be better to obtain a vaccine from Russia or China, instead of the US or UK.”',\n",

       "  'text': \"While it is expected that at least two Covid-19 vaccines will be registered globally by next month, the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) on Monday finalised its recommendations for the procurement of the vaccine against the deadly disease.\\n\\nThe recommendations will be presented before the federal cabinet during its meeting scheduled for Tuesday (tomorrow), and approval will be sought to avail the opportunity to get the vaccine at the earliest.\\n\\nThis was disclosed by federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar.\\n\\n“NCOC today finalised its recommendations for procurement of Covid vaccine. These will be presented to the cabinet tomorrow for approval. The task force of experts headed by SAPM health Dr Faisal Sultan had developed the recommendations which were discussed and finalised today,” he said in a tweet on Monday.\\n\\nA senior official of the Ministry of National Health Services (NHS), requesting not to be named, said that different options were being discussed for the last four months.\\n\\nAlso read: We can stop Covid-19: Moderna vaccine success gives world more hope\\n\\n“However, unfortunately, the process was derailed every time due to different reasons such as [possible] side effects of the vaccines, which vaccine would be available earlier etc., so different options were being considered and reviewed at the same time,” he said.\\n\\n“As we speak, it is expected that at least two vaccines will be registered, somewhere in the world, in December 2020. We have to make arrangements to get the vaccine at the earliest. Moreover, it has been decided that the vaccine will be given to healthcare workers, senior citizens and people suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, etc., on a priority basis,” he said.\\n\\nThe official said the proposals will be discussed with the federal cabinet and after getting its approval steps will be taken for vaccine procurement.\\n\\nReplying to a question, he said the shelf price of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine was $20 and two shots of the vaccine will be provided to each person so it will cost $40 to vaccinate each person. The vaccine of AstraZeneca, meanwhile, will be available for $4 per dose so $8 will be required to vaccinate one person, he added.\\n\\n“However we need to remember that it is the shelf price and can be negotiated. The price depends on the quantity we want and available stock. I believe the price can be reduced if we order at the earliest or if we let others purchase fist and stand at the end of the queue,” he said.\\n\\nEarlier this month, Prime Minister Imran Khan had given the approval to allocate US $100 million and allowed advance payment for procurement of the vaccine at the earliest.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Health experts accuse both the government and the opposition of “politicising” the Covid-19 pandemic, which they say has created a “widespread confusion” among the general public about the disease.\\n\\n“The government and the opposition have politicised a pure health issue, sending conflicting messages to the general public about the disease,” Dr Rana Jawad Asghar, an Islamabad-based epidemiologist told Anadolu Agency.\\n\\nTheir conflicting messages, he observed, have brought the masses to a point where they pay no heed to health experts’ advice and warnings. Many believe the disease does not even exist, he noted.\\n\\nAlso read: Why the coronavirus succumbed to politics in Pakistan\\n\\n“I cannot blame the public alone. When they see their leaders inviting the public to the rallies, not wearing masks, and blaming each other for the spread of the disease, why would they listen to the health experts?” Asghar, an adjunct professor of epidemiology at the University of Nebraska in the US, said, referring to recent opposition and government rallies and huge public meetings held across the country.\\n\\nCiting the example of US President Donald Trump, who has time and again downplayed health experts’ warnings regarding the spread of the virus, he said Pakistani politicians are practically “doing the same thing”.\\n\\n“They must stop using the disease to settle their political score,” he said.\\n\\nSeconding Asghar’s view, Dr Qaisar Sajjad, the secretary general of the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) — a nationwide body of health professionals, warned that the public’s “non-serious” attitude along with “politicisation” of the issue might lead to a disaster.\\n\\n“Both the government and the opposition are taking the pandemic to a point where everyone gets infected in the country,” Sajjad, who himself is in isolation after getting infected by the virus, told Anadolu Agency by telephone.\\n\\n“Why would the people [take] coronavirus seriously when their leaders are not taking it seriously?” he questioned.\\n\\nAlthough the government last month reimposed restrictions including a ban on rallies and gatherings in a bid to stem the surging coronavirus cases, the defiant 11-party Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) opposition alliance refused to call off its scheduled public meetings.\\n\\nEditorial: Political leaders are putting the people's lives at risk through their careless approach to the virus\\n\\nTens of thousands of opposition supporters gathered in Lahore on Sunday to attend the last rally of the first phase of the opposition's anti-government movement, despite the ban.\\n\\nSeveral government ministers also addressed public meetings in recent weeks, mainly in Khyber Pakhtunkhawa.\\n\\nThe Jamaat-i-Islami, however, postponed its protest meetings against the government due to a second wave of Covid-19.\\n\\nLack of uniform policy\\n\\nPakistan has witnessed a spike in Covid-19 cases and deaths in recent weeks. The country recorded 70 deaths from the virus on Wednesday.\\n\\nWith 2,545 new infections on Wednesday, the total caseload in the country has reached 448,522, including 9,080 deaths. Pakistan has tested over 6.17 million people for the virus to date.\\n\\nThe total number of active cases in the country stands at 43,851.\\n\\nTerming the country’s incumbent risk communication strategy “weak”, Dr Asghar urged the government to come up with a “workable” set of safety precautions and restrictions to contain the raging pandemic.\\n\\n“The state should not just announce a strategy and expect the people to simply follow that. The policy must be workable, and [formulated] with the consultation of the stakeholders,“ he maintained.\\n\\nSharing a similar view, PMA's Dr Sajjad said the lack of a uniform strategy has harmed the efforts to stem the pandemic.\\n\\n“There should be one policy to be implemented across the country. Apart from politicians, the government should involve health experts, scientists, and traders to develop a uniform policy to implement across the country,” he said.\\n\\nA third wave?\\n\\nFaisal Sultan, special assistant to the prime minister on health, told Anadolu Agency last week that Pakistan was negotiating with China, Russia and others to procure coronavirus vaccines.\\n\\nThe vaccine, he said, would be available in Pakistan sometime between January and March next year, and administered to health workers and senior citizens in the first phase.\\n\\nDr Asghar said it’s hard to predict about a third wave of coronavirus in the country after winters.\\n\\n“Will there a third wave or not, it’s difficult to say at this stage because our data is incomplete and weak,” he commented.\\n\\n“Instead of politicians, the scientific community should be brought in front. Their data-based evaluation and strategy can do much better,” he emphasised.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Six members of the Pakistan cricket squad, which is currently on a tour to New Zealand, have tested positive for the coronavirus, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) said on Thursday.\\n\\nThe team also received a “final warning” for flouting quarantine rules. New Zealand health authorities revoked the players\\' ability to train while in isolation at their Christchurch hotel, making clear they would not tolerate risky behaviour in a country that has largely eradicated the virus.\\n\\nIn a statement posted on its website, NZC said it was \"made aware today that six members of the Pakistan touring squad, currently in managed isolation in Christchurch, have tested positive for Covid-19\". However, the statement did not name the players.\\n\\nTwo of the members who tested positive were \"historical cases\", it said, while the other four were new infections. NZC said the infected players would be moved into the quarantine wing of the managed isolation facility where they were staying.\\n\\nThe Pakistan team would also not be able to train until an investigation into the emergence of the cases has been completed, it added.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the country\\'s director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, said in a statement: \"It is a privilege to come to New Zealand to play sport, but in return teams must stick to the rules that are designed to keep Covid-19 out of our communities.\"\\n\\nBloomfield said CCTV showed members of the tour party breaching social distancing protocols.\\n\\n“The team as a whole has been issued with a final warning,” he said. “It\\'s important to note that all incidents of breaches occurred within the facility and there is no risk to the public.”\\n\\nPakistan Cricket Board chief executive Wasim Khan was told by New Zealand authorities that \"one more breach\" of the country\\'s Covid-19 protocols would lead to the entire Pakistan squad being deported, ESPNcricinfo reported.\\n\\n\"Boys, I spoke to the New Zealand government and they told us there were three or four breaches of protocols,\" Khan said in a WhatsApp voice message to the travelling players which was obtained by ESPNcricinfo.\\n\\n\"They have a zero-tolerance policy and they\\'ve given us a final warning. We understand that this is a difficult time for you, and you went through similar conditions in England. It\\'s not easy. But this is a matter of the nation\\'s respect and credibility. Observe these 14 days and then you\\'ll have the freedom to go to restaurants and roam about freely. They have told me in clear terms that if we commit one more breach, they\\'ll send us home.\"\\n\\nThe PCB CEO also told the players that being sent home without playing the scheduled matches would be \"hugely embarrassing\", according to the report.\\n\\nPakistan squad leaves for NZ\\n\\nAll members of the Pakistan cricket squad that left for New Zealand on Monday had been tested for the virus beforehand on four occasions, the results of which had come back negative.\\n\\nThe cricket body said it was also informed that \"some members of the Pakistan team had contravened protocols on the first day of managed isolation,\" adding that it would hold discussions with them to \"assist them in understanding the [isolation] requirements\".\\n\\nThe Pakistan squad, which includes both Pakistan Senior and Shaheen teams, comprises 34 players and 20 supporting staff.\\n\\nChief selector and head coach Misbahul Haq had picked 35 players for the tour but on Sunday dashing opener Fakhar Zaman was sidelined due to high fever and could not travel with the team.\\n\\nPakistan will play two Tests and three T20s while Shaheens will also play two four-day and three T20 matches against New Zealand ‘A’. Pakistan’s T20 series will commence from Dec 18 and the Test series will start from Dec 26.\\n\\nBabar Azam is leading Pakistan in all formats, including Tests, for the first time after having replaced Azhar Ali in the longer version of the game.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Rahul Gandhi, a leader of India\\'s Congress Party, on Friday yet again criticised the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party\\'s (BJP) response to the coronavirus pandemic, saying \"even Pakistan and Afghanistan handled Covid better than India\".\\n\\nHe made these remarks in a tweet, accompanied by a graph of International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) gross domestic product (GDP) projections for several countries and a wry comment: \"Another solid achievement by the BJP government.\"\\n\\nAccording to the graph, Indian economy is expected to contract by 10.3 per cent this year, the highest contraction among the other countries — China, Bhutan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal and Afghanistan.\\n\\nAccording to Hindustan Times, this would be the biggest slump of any major emerging nation and the worst since Independence.\\n\\nThe IMF, in its World Economic Outlook (WEO) 2020 shared on Tuesday, cut its forecast for India’s GDP growth, which fell at its steepest pace of 23.9pc in the June quarter. It now expects Asia’s third-largest economy to contract 10.3pc for the fiscal year compared with its June prediction of a 4.5pc drop.\\n\\nGandhi, following the IMF report, had tweeted: “Solid achievement of six years of BJP’s hate-filled cultural nationalism: Bangladesh set to overtake India.”\\n\\nIMF said forecasts for the global economy are “somewhat less dire” as rich nations and China have rebounded quicker than expected from coronavirus lockdowns, but the outlook for many emerging markets has worsened.\\n\\nRead: IMF forecasts 1pc growth, rising unemployment in Pakistan\\n\\nThe IMF said the virus was continuing to spread in large countries, including India and Indonesia, and those economies were far more dependent on hard-hit sectors including tourism and commodities as well as on remittances and other sources of external finance.\\n\\nIndia\\'s fight against coronavirus\\n\\nIndia’s tally of coronavirus infections stood at 7.37 million on Friday, having risen by 63,371 in the last 24 hours, health ministry data showed.\\n\\nDeaths from Covid-19 infections rose by 895 to 112,161, the ministry said.\\n\\nIndia crossed the 7 million mark on Sunday, adding a million cases in just 13 days. It has the world’s second-highest tally after the United States, where the figure is nearing 8 million.\\n\\nBut some experts say that India’s tally may not be reliable because of poor reporting and inadequate health infrastructure. India is also relying heavily on antigen tests, which are faster but less accurate than traditional RT-PCR tests.\\n\\nHealth officials have also warned about the potential for the virus to spread during the religious festival season beginning later this month.\\n\\nWith the economy leaving millions jobless, the Indian government is continuing to relax lockdown restrictions that were imposed in late March. The government in May announced a $266 billion stimulus package, but consumer demand and manufacturing are yet to recover.\\n\\nA large number of offices, shops, businesses, liquor stores, bars and restaurants have reopened. Restricted domestic and international evacuation flights are being operated along with train services.',\n",

       "  'text': 'How long does protection from Covid-19 vaccines last?\\n\\nExperts don’t know yet because they’re still studying vaccinated people to see when protection might wear off. How well the vaccines work against emerging variants will also determine if, when and how often additional shots might be needed.\\n\\n“We only have information for as long as the vaccines have been studied,” said Deborah Fuller, a vaccine researcher at the University of Washington. “We have to study the vaccinated population and start to see, at what point do people become vulnerable again to the virus?”\\n\\nSo far, Pfizer’s ongoing trial indicates the company’s two-dose vaccine remains highly effective for at least six months, and likely longer. People who got Moderna’s vaccine also still had notable levels of virus-fighting antibodies six months after the second required shot.\\n\\nAntibodies also don’t tell the whole story. To fight off intruders like viruses, our immune systems also have another line of defense called B and T cells, some of which can hang around long after antibody levels dwindle. If they encounter the same virus in the future, those battle-tested cells could potentially spring into action more quickly.\\n\\nEven if they don’t prevent illness entirely, they could help blunt its severity. But exactly what role such “memory” cells might play with the coronavirus — and for how long — isn’t yet known.\\n\\nWhile the current Covid-19 vaccines will likely last for at least about a year, they probably won’t offer lifelong protection, as with measles shots, said Dr Kathleen Neuzil, a vaccine expert at the University of Maryland.\\n\\n“It’s going to be somewhere in the middle of that very wide range,” she said.\\n\\nRead: Virus expected to last for long time despite vaccine rollout\\n\\nVariants are another reason we might need an additional shot.\\n\\nThe current vaccines are designed to work against a particular spike protein on the coronavirus, said Mehul Suthar of the Emory Vaccine Centre. If the virus mutates enough over time, vaccines might need to be updated to boost their effectiveness.\\n\\nSo far, the vaccines appear protective against the notable variants that have emerged, though somewhat less so on the one first detected in South Africa.\\n\\nIf it turns out we need another shot, a single dose could extend protection of the current shots or contain vaccination for one or more variants.\\n\\nThe need for follow-up shots will also depend partly on the success of the vaccination push globally, and tamping down transmission of the virus and emerging variants.',\n",

       "  'text': 'UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan has urged the international community to ensure that Covid-19 vaccine is made available to all and is distributed across the globe without any discrimination or favour.\\n\\nAt a G-77 ministerial meeting in New York, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the United Nations Munir Akram also emphasised the need to rebuild the economies destroyed by this pandemic.\\n\\nPakistan has reported 2,304 coronavirus cases on Friday, the highest since July, indicating a 27 per cent increase since Thursday. The virus also claimed 37 lives on Friday.\\n\\n“A vaccine once developed must be available to all without discrimination and without favour,” the Pakistani envoy said. “But the critical requirement today is adequate finance to enable our economies to recover from the crisis.”\\n\\nAmbassador identifies debt suspension as the first economic need of pandemic-hit developing nations\\n\\nAmbassador Akram, who is also the president of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, pointed out that the pandemic had devastated the economies of many developed countries, adding to the multi-dimensional challenges they were already facing from climate change and other endemic problems.\\n\\n“We must at this time, focus on specific objectives that we need to achieve to recover from the devastation that we are facing. For the group of 77, unity is the key to success in achieving the objective,” he said.\\n\\nThe Group of 77 is a coalition of 134 developing countries, designed to promote their collective economic interests and to create a joint negotiating capacity within the United Nations.\\n\\nAmbassador Akram identified debt suspension as the first economic need of the developing nations devastated by the pandemic.\\n\\nHe recalled that in April, Prime Minister Imran Khan launched an initiative for debt relief to help developing countries deal with this crisis. “We believe that the debt suspension by the G20 should be extended until … we have recovered from the pandemic,” the Pakistani envoy said. G20 or Group of Twenty is an international forum for the governments and central bank governors from 19 countries and the European Union.\\n\\n“The least developed countries’ debt should be cancelled, as they have asked,” Ambassador Akram said. “The debt restructuring for other developing countries … must be implemented and sizable net inflows from the multilateral development banks should be invigorated.” The debt restructuring should include “efficient debt buybacks and debt swaps,” he added.\\n\\nThe Pakistani envoy emphasised the need to expand concessional finance through official development assistance (ODA) and other sources and called for private sector participation in debt suspension. This should include global liquidity and financial stability facilities proposed by the Economic Commission for Africa, he added.\\n\\n“And finally, and most importantly, the issuance of new SDRs, and the repurposing of existing and utilised SDRs for developing countries,” he said. SDRs or special drawing rights are supplementary foreign exchange reserves defined and maintained by the International Monetary Fund.\\n\\nAmbassador Akram said that most of these actions were already envisaged in the 2015 Addis Ababa plan that sets the UN agenda for sustainable development.\\n\\nThe plan underlines the need for investment in sustainable and resilient infrastructure, energy, transport, water, sanitation as prerequisites for achieving development goals.\\n\\nAmbassador Akram said that investment in infrastructure would affect 92 per cent of sustainable development goals. “We need to mobilise an additional $1.5. trillion annually for investment in sustainable infrastructure,” he said.\\n\\nPublished in Dawn, November 14th, 2020',\n",

       "  'text': 'Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar said on Saturday that the federal government would not hold a monopoly on the import of coronavirus vaccines, adding that provinces and the private sector were free to import vaccines subject to approval of the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap).\\n\\nUmar — who also serves as chief of the National Command and Operations Centre (NCOC) — made the statement in Geo News show \\'Naya Pakistan\\'. \"From day 1, the NCOC has adopted the policy that the federal government shall not have the monopoly to import anti-coronavirus vaccines,\" he said. \"Provinces and private entities including hospitals have been allowed to import the vaccines that are approved by Drap.\"\\n\\nUmar said that once the AstraZeneca vaccine was approved by the regulatory authority, it may be imported by the Sindh government if the latter could procure supplies from abroad. He further said that he encouraged not only the Sindh government \"but all provincial governments to import the vaccine from abroad\".\\n\\nHe was responding to Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho\\'s comments from earlier in the day, where she had urged the federal government to allow the provincial government to procure a vaccine for the novel coronavirus as she criticised the Centre over its \\'slow approach\\' in ordering vaccines. She had further said that the Centre should also play its part in providing vaccines to Sindh but the provincial government must be allowed to procure vaccines for its residents.\\n\\nUmar said he wanted to clear any misunderstandings, stating that provinces were free as a matter of policy since day one to import vaccines after approval.\\n\\nThe NCOC chief also addressed and gave updates on other aspects of Pakistan\\'s vaccination rollout. He said China\\'s Sinopharm vaccine was also approved by a technical committee and only the matter of its name for local distribution remained, which would be decided by Tuesday. He added that the Chinese government was itself working directly with Pakistan to facilitate doses of Sinopharm and \"they will let us know about the first batch of vaccines by Tuesday.\"\\n\\nSpeaking about China\\'s CanSino vaccine for which phase three clinical trials are currently underway in Pakistan, he said that results of its trial would arrive by the second half of February and \"if those are positive then it too will be available in March\".\\n\\nHe added that with Pakistan being a signatory to the Covax alliance, vaccines from multiple sources would be procured and made available in the first quarter of the year.\\n\\nCovax is an alliance that had been set up by Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI), Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and World Health Organisation in April last year. It has pledged provision of free vaccine for 20pc of the population of around 190 countries, including Pakistan.\\n\\nAstraZeneca approved in Pakistan\\n\\nDrap earlier on Saturday authorised the AstraZeneca Covid-19 shot for emergency use in Pakistan, making it the first vaccine to get local approval.\\n\\n“Drap granted emergency use authorisation to AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine,” Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Healh Dr Faisal Sultan told Reuters.\\n\\nPakistan has also pre-booked more than a million doses of Sinopharm\\'s vaccine from China, Sultan said, adding that the Sinopharm vaccine is awaiting approval from Drap, which has received and reviewed its data. Its efficacy rate was announced at 79.3 per cent by Chinese health authorities.\\n\\n“We are in the process to obtain Western origin and other vaccines both via bilateral purchase agreements as well as via the Covax facility,” Sultan had said.',\n",

       "  'title': 'WHO vaccine scheme risks failure, leaving poor countries no Covid shots until 2024',\n",
       "  'text': 'The global scheme to deliver Covid-19 vaccines to poorer countries faces a “very high” risk of failure, potentially leaving nations home to billions of people with no access to vaccines until as late as 2024, internal documents say.\\n\\nThe World Health Organisation\\'s (WHO) COVAX programme is the main global scheme to vaccinate people in poor and middle-income countries around the world against the coronavirus.\\n\\nIt aims to deliver at least two billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021 to cover 20 per cent of the most vulnerable people in 91 poor and middle-income countries, mostly in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Pakistan has also signed up for the programme and is relying on it to vaccinate as much as 20 per cent of its population, according to the health ministry.\\n\\nBut in internal documents reviewed by Reuters, the scheme\\'s promoters say the programme is struggling from a lack of funds, supply risks and complex contractual arrangements which could make it impossible to achieve its goals.\\n\\n“The risk of a failure to establish a successful COVAX Facility is very high,” says an internal report to the board of Gavi, an alliance of governments, drug companies, charities and international organisations that arranges global vaccination campaigns.\\n\\nGavi co-leads COVAX alongside the WHO. The report and other documents prepared by Gavi are being discussed at Gavi\\'s board meetings on December 15-17.\\n\\nThe failure of the facility could leave people in poor nations without any access to Covid-19 vaccines until 2024, one of the documents says.\\n\\nThe risk of failure is higher because the scheme was set up so quickly, operating in “uncharted territory\", the report says.\\n\\n“Current risk exposure is deemed outside of risk appetite until there is full clarity on the size of risks and possibilities to mitigate them,” it says. “It therefore requires intensive mitigation efforts to bring the risk within risk appetite.”\\n\\nGavi hired Citigroup last month to provide advice on how to mitigate financial risks.\\n\\nIn one November 25 memo included in the documents submitted to the Gavi board, Citi advisors said the biggest risk to the programme was from clauses in supply contracts that allow countries not to buy vaccines booked through COVAX.\\n\\nA potential mismatch between vaccine supply and demand “is not a commercial risk efficiently mitigated by the market or the MDBs,” the Citi advisors wrote, referring to multilateral development banks such as the World Bank.\\n\\n“Therefore it must either be mitigated through contract negotiation or through a Gavi risk absorption layer that is carefully managed by a management and governance structure.”\\n\\nAsked about the documents, a Gavi spokesman said the body remains confident it can achieve its goals.\\n\\n“It would be irresponsible not to assess the risks inherent to such a massive and complex undertaking, and to build policies and instruments to mitigate those risks,” he added.\\n\\nThe WHO did not respond to a request for comment. In the past it has let Gavi take the lead in public comments about the COVAX programme.\\n\\nCitibank said in a statement: “As a financial adviser, we are responsible for helping Gavi plan for a range of scenarios related to the COVAX facility and supporting their efforts to mitigate potential risks.”\\n\\nSupply deals\\n\\nCOVAX\\'s plans rely on cheaper vaccines that have so far yet to receive approval, rather than vaccines from frontrunners Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna that use more expensive new mRNA technology.\\n\\nThe Pfizer vaccine has already been approved for emergency use in several countries and deployed in Britain and the United States, and the Moderna vaccine is expected to be similarly approved soon.\\n\\nCOVAX has so far reached non-binding supply agreements with AstraZeneca, Novavax and Sanofi for a total of 400 million doses, with options to order several hundred million additional shots, one of the Gavi documents says.\\n\\nBut the three companies have all faced delays in their trials that could push back some possible regulatory approvals to the second half of 2021 or later.\\n\\nThis could also increase COVAX\\'s financial needs. Its financial assumptions are based on an average cost of $5.20 per dose, one of the documents says.\\n\\nPfizer\\'s vaccines costs about $18.40-$19.50 per dose, while Moderna\\'s costs $25-$37. COVAX has no supply deals with either of those firms. Nor is it prioritising investment in ultra-cold distribution chains in poor countries, necessary for the Pfizer vaccine, as it still expects to use mostly shots which require more conventional cold storage, one of the Gavi documents says.\\n\\nOn Tuesday a WHO senior official said the agency was in talks with Pfizer and Moderna to include their Covid-19 vaccines as part of an early global rollout at a cost for poor countries possibly lower than current market prices.\\n\\nOther shots are being developed worldwide and COVAX wants to expand its portfolio to include vaccines from other companies.\\n\\nRich countries, which have booked most of the currently available stocks of Covid-19 vaccines, are also planning to donate some excess doses to poor countries, although is not clear whether that would be through COVAX.\\n\\nFinancial pressure\\n\\nTo meet its target of vaccinating at least 20pc of people in poor countries next year, COVAX says it needs $4.9 billion in addition to $2.1 billion it has already raised.\\n\\nIf vaccine prices are higher than forecast, supply is delayed or the additional funds are not fully collected, the facility faces the prospect of failure, the documents say.\\n\\nSo far Britain and European Union countries are the main donors to COVAX, while the United States and China have made no financial commitments.\\n\\nThe World Bank and other multilateral financial institutions are offering cheap loans to poor countries to help them buy and deploy vaccines through COVAX.\\n\\nThe facility is issuing vaccine bonds which could raise as much as $1.5 billion next year if donors agreed to cover the costs, one of the Gavi documents says. COVAX is also receiving funds from private donors, mainly the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\\n\\nBut even under the best financial conditions, COVAX could still face failure, because of disproportionate financial risks caused by its complex deal-making process.\\n\\nCOVAX signs advance purchase contracts with companies on vaccine supplies that need to be paid for by donors or receiving countries that have the means to afford them.\\n\\nBut under clauses included in COVAX contracts, countries could still refuse to buy pre-ordered volumes if they prefer other vaccines, or if they manage to acquire them through other schemes, either faster or at better prices.\\n\\nThe facility could also face losses if countries were not able to pay for their orders, or even if herd immunity were developed too quickly, making vaccines no longer necessary, the Citigroup report said.\\n\\nIt proposed a strategy to mitigate these risks including through changes in supply contracts.',\n",

He said Sindh had not opted to be part of the measure for now.\\n\\nHe added that this was a \"big decision\" taken because neighbouring India was reporting 350,000 or more Covid cases on a daily basis.\\n\\nThe minister said the Pakistan Army had always stood with the people when floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters hit the country, therefore, it was decided during a meeting of the National Coordination Committee (NCC) to seek the army\\'s services to enforce the coronavirus SOPs.\\n\\nOrders issued by the Ministry of Interior, seen by Dawn.com, notified the deployment of the armed forces, citing the decision taken during the NCC meeting on April 23.\\n\\n\"The federal government, in exercise of the powers conferred under Article 245 of the Constitution [...], is pleased to authorise deployment of sufficient strength of troops of Pakistan Army, we.f. 25th April, 2021, on the requisition of the Government of Punjab in the province in connection with enforcement of NCC/NCOC guidelines on Covid-19 and matters ancillary thereto subject to laws enforced in Pakistan,\" one of the orders said.\\n\\nIt said the requirement of troops will be worked out by the Punjab government in coordination with the army authorities, adding that \"the date for de-requisitioning of army troops will be decided subsequently on the basis of mutual consultation of all stakeholders and decision by the NCC/NCOC.\" Similar notifications were issued for KP, Balochistan, Islamabad, AJK and GB.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the GB Home Department issued a notification for the deployment of army and Rangers personnel in cities with a Covid-19 positivity rate of more than five per cent. It also banned dining at restaurants and closed all parks in the region.\\n\\nOn Friday, Prime Minister Imran Khan said he had asked the Pakistan Army to assist the police and law enforcement agencies in enforcing Covid-19 SOPs, warning that Pakistan may soon be facing a situation similar to India if the current trend continued.\\n\\nAddressing the nation after a meeting of the NCC, he said: \"I am appealing to you to follow SOPs so that we don\\'t have to take steps that India is taking which means imposing lockdowns. Half the problem is solved when you wear face masks.\"\\n\\nA day later, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government requested the federal government to authorise the deployment of armed forces and civil armed forces in the province to ensure effective implementation of the Covid-19 guidelines\\n\\nLikewise, the Balochistan government said the army would be called in if the people did not follow the SOPs to save them from the deadly virus.\\n\\nPakis\\xadtan on Saturday saw a record 157 deaths from Covid-19 since the outbreak of the pandemic in the country, while the National Command and Opera\\xadtion Centre (NCOC) decided to allow the army, Frontier Constabulary (FC) and Rangers to assist law enforcement agencies in enforcing SOPs if requested by the provincial governments.\\n\\nThe NCOC meeting, which was presided over by Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar, deliberated upon the proposed lockdowns in high virus prevalence cities with stakeholders.\\n\\nThe participants were of the view that if cases continued to rise, critical care facilities in that particular city would become overwhelmed.\\n\\n“The decision on lockdown will be taken after discussions with all stakeholders. The purpose of the lockdowns will be to contain the spread of the disease through implementation of SOPs,” the forum’s statement said.\\n\\n“A few proposed restrictions will include closure of markets and malls, less essential services, ban on inter-city public transport and shutting down of education institutions,” it added.\\n\\nWith additional reporting by Imtiaz Ali Taj in Gilgit.',\n",

Hospitals in Delhi and across the country are turning away patients after running out of medical oxygen and beds.\\n\\n“We were confident, our spirits were up after successfully tackling the first wave, but this storm has shaken the nation,” Modi said in a radio address.\\n\\nLockdown in Delhi extended; US, Germany vow to extend helping hand\\n\\nHis government has faced criticism that it let its guard down earlier this year, allowed big religious and political gatherings to take place when India’s cases fell to below 10,000 a day and did not plan for boosted healthcare systems.\\n\\nHospitals and doctors have put out urgent notices saying they are unable to cope with the rush of patients.\\n\\nOutside a Sikh temple in Ghaziabad city on the outskirts of Delhi, the street resembled an emergency ward of a hospital, but crammed with cars carrying Covid-19 patients gasping for breath as they were hooked up to hand-held oxygen tanks.\\n\\nElsewhere, people were arranging stretchers and oxygen cylinders outside hospitals as they desperately pleaded for authorities to take patients in, photographers said.\\n\\n“Every day, it’s the same situation, we are left with two hours of oxygen, we only get assurances from the authorities,” one doctor said on television.\\n\\nDelhi’s Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal extended a lockdown in the capital that had been due to end on Monday for a week. Covid-19 is killing one person every four minutes in the city.\\n\\nEpidemiologists and virologists say more infectious variants of the virus, including an Indian one known as B.1.6.1.7, have fuelled the ferocious surge.\\n\\nDoctors at New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences have found that one patient is now infecting up to nine in 10 contacts, compared to about four last year.\\n\\nIndia, a country of 1.3 billion people, has recorded a total of 16.96 million infections and 192,311 coronavirus deaths, after 2,767 more died overnight, health ministry data showed.\\n\\nIn the last month alone, daily cases have gone up eight times and deaths by 10 times.

       "  'text': \"We break down for you what each of these numbers imply and why you should care for any or all of them.\\n\\nFor the past three months, the world has watched in disbelief as health authorities have announced numbers of new patients affected by the novel coronavirus.\\n\\nOne day, the Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Zafar Mirza warns the nation that fatality rate could rise if preventive measures aren’t taken.\\n\\nThen there is the Sindh chief minister, who fears that an increase in locally transmitted cases is a bad omen.\\n\\nSo what do these numbers mean?\\n\\nHere, we break down for you what each of these numbers imply and why you should care for any or all of them.\\n\\nConfirmed cases\\n\\nThe number of persons affected by the novel coronavirus, which causes a disease called Covid-19, has risen past 1.8 million worldwide, as of April 12.\\n\\nBut like with all data, this number too should be read with a pinch of salt. For all we know, this could well be just a fraction of the actual persons infected by the virus.\\n\\nThere are multiple reasons for this:\\n\\nIn Pakistan for example, patients are less willing to come forward due to stigma or fear of being quarantined\\n\\nNot enough tests being conducted\\n\\nDeliberate under-reporting by governments\\n\\nEfficacy and accuracy of tests being conducted leading to false negatives\\n\\nFalse-positives (Rare but certainly a possibility)\\n\\nSuspected cases\\n\\nOne of the biggest obstacles in the global response to the Covid-19 pandemic is that so little is known about the virus that causes it. Over the past three months, scientists from around the world have put their heads together to figure out the puzzle.\\n\\nAnd yet, a new advisory is issued almost everyday based on new evidence from groundbreaking research.\\n\\nWhile the scientific community struggles to find an antidote, governments have been struggling to muster the resources required to control the spread of the virus.\\n\\nWhat we do know is that the virus causes specific symptoms when it affects the human body. What we also know is that it affects the elderly and the immune-suppressed more than others. This is how authorities can monitor suspected cases.\\n\\nIn Pakistan, for example, you will only be tested if you are running a fever and can prove you have either travelled or met someone who has tested positive for the virus.\\n\\nHowever, a significant percentage of the population does not show any symptoms from the virus. This is what skews the data.\\n\\nWhat’s more dangerous is that these asymptomatic patients are effectively carriers and can infect others who may be more vulnerable.\\n\\nNumber of tests\\n\\nFor Nate Silver of Five-Three-Eight, an online US-based publication that is in the habit of incorporating big data into intelligible stories, this is the most important number to be looking at .\\n\\nIn his recent report, titled “Coronavirus Case Counts Are Meaningless”, Silver argues that if you’re not accounting for the number of tests when looking at Covid-19 data, your analysis could well be just the opposite of what is actually true.\\n\\nAnd that is where governments must be careful. In Silver’s words: “A country where the case count is increasing because it’s doing more testing, for instance, might actually be getting its epidemic under control. Alternatively, in a country where the reported number of new cases is declining, the situation could actually be getting worse, either because its system is too overwhelmed to do adequate testing or because it’s ramping down on testing for PR reasons.”\\n\\nCase Fatality Rate (CFR)\\n\\nFor many epidemiologists (experts in the branch of medicine that deals with the incidence, distribution, and possible control of diseases), this is the number that holds the key to understanding the prevalence and severity of a pandemic.\\n\\nThe case fatality rate, according to the Dictionary of Epidemiology, is “the proportion of cases of a specified condition that are fatal within a specified time”. In other words, how many of the patients who test positive eventually die within a specified time.\\n\\nThis is the metric used by epidemiologists to gauge the severity of pandemics such as that caused by Ebola or even the various strains of influenza and to guide responses.\\n\\nIn the case of Covid-19, however, instead of relying on the number of infections, or the CFR, researchers are looking at the daily deaths attributed to Covid-19, according to this report on Nature magazine.\\n\\nSome experts are of the view that total deaths from the virus over time is a better stat to compare how much the outbreak has devastated countries instead of looking at total cases. That is because they argue that total positive cases are heavily correlated to the number of tests done – which in itself varies from place to place depending on the country's resources and strategies employed and because a significant number of infected persons are asymptomatic.\\n\\nReproduction ratio or R\\n\\nIn epidemiological models, the ‘reproduction ratio’ or R stands for the number of persons each infected person goes on to infect.\\n\\nSilver explains it like this: “If a disease has an R of 3, that means each infected person transmits it to three more people. So one initial case becomes three newly infected people, which becomes nine people, which becomes 27 people, which becomes 81 people, and so forth — the very nature of exponential growth is that it gets out of hand quickly!”\\n\\nThe R for Covid-19, established by the WHO from data gleaned from Chinese authorities, was 2.6. That meant every infected would infect at least two other people.\\n\\nThis is why social distancing is so important to curb the spread of the coronavirus. In doing so, authorities around the world, including Pakistan, have been aiming to keep the R under 1.\\n\\nLocally transmitted cases\\n\\nThe first case of Covid-19 reported on Pakistani soil was that of a person who had just returned from Iran. Over the next few weeks, as the number of patients rose, almost all of them had some travel history.\\n\\nThe government responded by temporarily locking down airports and banning the entry of both Pakistani citizens and foreigners alike.\\n\\nOn April 12, SAPM Dr Zafar Mirza announced that half the Covid-19 cases in the country are now locally transmitted.\\n\\nThis is indeed worrying as it denotes that the virus has now gained a foothold within our communities and is spreading among the local population.\\n\\nSo which number?\\n\\nThe Covid-19 pandemic will possibly be studied by epidemiologists and other researchers for years to come. Plenty will be said about the global response and plenty more about the lack of it.\\n\\nRight now, however, when we look at these numbers, it is important to remember that they may not be telling the complete picture. In some cases, a combination of these stats may need to be looked at to develop a better picture of the situation on the ground.\\n\\nThat being said, context is key when looking at Covid-19 data and if health experts are able to read into these numbers with a holistic approach, it should give them a fair idea of the virus’ trajectory in the region and guide their response.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Prime Minister Imran Khan says US President Donald Trump would have easily won the 2020 US Presidential Election despite all the media projections against him, if it weren\\'t for the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nIn an interview on Express News programme \"To The Point\" aired on Saturday, the premier cited the example of Trump\\'s re-election loss to say that although media had a very important role in society, it wasn\\'t a threat to the rule of a country\\'s leader.\\n\\n\"I have no problems with [criticism in] the media. Media can only cause a temporary loss,\" he told host Mansoor Ali Khan.\\n\\n\"The most classic example is of Donald Trump. The way the entire mainstream media attacked [him], it appeared as if Trump would lose by a landslide. [Instead] he bagged the highest number of votes in American history; it\\'s a separate thing that [Joe] Biden received even more votes.\"\\n\\nThe prime minister said if Covid-19 had not caused widespread unemployment and deaths in the US, \"then Donald Trump would have won no matter what the media did\".\\n\\nHe said media had a big role in democracy but it sometimes didn\\'t exhibit \"responsibility along with its freedom\" and resorted to \"propaganda, slander campaign\" and disinformation which could hurt the government efforts for economic revival.\\n\\nRecalling his association with the media since his cricketing days, the premier said \"criticism is an asset of society\" and freedom of expression was crucial to the progression of human thought.\\n\\nAsked to comment on the temporary disappearances of journalist Matiullah Jan, reporter Ali Imran Syed and Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan joint director Sajid Gondal, the prime minister replied: \"I don\\'t have an idea what really happened with them [...] every time we took notice of their disappearance, the missing person was retrieved.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t have an idea because I had left it upon the interior ministry,\" Imran added when asked whether he had any information who had picked up the three men.\\n\\nPrime Minister Imran also defended the appointment of Naeem Bukhari as the Pakistan Television chairperson, saying although he was his lawyer in the Panamagate case, Bukhari had \"remained a huge personality on PTV for five decades\" and therefore he was considered to be the right man for the job.\\n\\nAsked about Bukhari\\'s comment regarding a ‘blackout’ of the opposition on state-run PTV, the premier took a different line.\\n\\nHe said the opposition should be given airtime on PTV because the channel would lose its ratings if it only became a government mouthpiece.\\n\\n\\'No pressure\\'\\n\\nThe prime minister rubbished opposition allegations of him being \"selected\", saying PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif himself was launched into politics by military generals while PPP founder Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had served as a minister under a military dictator for several years.\\n\\nHe said both PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz and PPP chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari would not have reached their positions if they hadn\\'t utilised their family names.\\n\\nAsked if he had \"resisted\" the army leadership on any issue in the past 2.5 years, Prime Minister Imran said: \"I would resist the army if it put any pressure on me. The army hasn\\'t ever asked me not to do a single thing that I wanted to do.\"\\n\\nHe said his government\\'s foreign policy was exactly according to the PTI manifesto, including regarding the Afghan conflict and ties with Muslim countries, and he had not come under any pressure.\\n\\nThe premier also defended the appointment of retired Lt Gen Asim Saleem Bajwa as the chairman of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Authority, saying he was the \"best option\" for the post because of his prior experience working in Balochistan as the commander of the Southern Command, and that there was no pressure to appoint him.\\n\\nAsked why Bajwa\\'s resignation as special assistant to the prime minister on information and broadcasting was subsequently accepted, Imran said he had been given that charge \"temporarily\" to help revamp the information ministry.\\n\\n\"We had brought him so that his experience [as the ISPR chief] could be used to devise a reform roadmap,\" he added.\\n\\nThe premier reiterated that Bajwa had given a \"detailed reply\" to the corruption allegations levelled against his family businesses but said he could not term him \"neat and clean\" because it was not his job to do so.\\n\\n\"Those were only allegations. If somebody wants they can approach NAB (National Accountability Bureau) and request it to investigate the allegations against him,\" he stressed.\\n\\nTareen still part of PTI?\\n\\nPrime Minister Imran dismissed opposition allegations of victimisation through the NAB, saying most of the existing corruption cases against PML-N and PPP leaders were instituted by themselves against each other during their respective terms.\\n\\n\"We have left the institutions totally independent [and] we already have no control over NAB,\" he said.\\n\\nResponding to allegations that the government had not taken any action against PTI\\'s \\'isolated\\' leader Jahangir Khan Tareen and Minister for Economic Affairs Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtiar following the report of the sugar inquiry commission, the premier said their cases were underway in courts, the Competition Commission of Pakistan and the Federal Investigation Agency and relevant departments had been asked to act on the report.\\n\\nAsked whether Tareen was still a part of the PTI, Imran said: \"He no longer has any position in the party. I will not interfere with the institutions; they will complete their process and whoever is involved will be punished.\"\\n\\n\"The case is still ongoing but yes, I feel sad,\" the premier said when asked about the loss of his former close friend Tareen\\'s companionship. \"Jahangir says he is completely innocent [...] but yes, he is passing through a very difficult time.\"\\n\\nAnswering another question regarding his former aide Firdous Ashiq Awan, who was removed from her post before being appointed the special assistant on information to the Punjab chief minister, the prime minister denied the reported corruption allegations against her.\\n\\n\"There was no corruption case against her. She had problems in the information department and with a couple of our people,\" he said, adding that he personally investigates against such allegations against government members through the Intelligence Bureau.\\n\\n\\'No rift with Saudi, UAE\\'\\n\\nThe prime minister defended his government\\'s foreign policy regarding Kashmir, saying it was due to its efforts that the issue had been internationalised.\\n\\nHe also denied allegations of a rift between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, saying the relationship was \"just fine\", and termed as false reports that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had recalled his airplane in which he (PM Imran) was travelling while returning to Pakistan from New York last year after addressing the United Nations General Assembly.\\n\\n\"We were returning in his plane but after it developed a fault, we had to return [to New York] and the plane had to be replaced,\" Imran added.\\n\\nHe said the government was in touch with the United Arab Emirates authorities regarding the suspension of visas for citizens of Pakistan and nearly 10 other countries, and added that he had a good relationship with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.',\n",

       "  'title': \"Is TB vaccine the reason behind Covid-19's less deadly effect in Pakistan? Experts are finding out\",\n",
       "  'text': 'Preliminary studies show countries with universal BCG vaccine programmes have much lower mortality rates from Covid-19.\\n\\nThe novel coronavirus has infected millions of people and led to tens of thousands of deaths around the globe. While it has forced almost the entire world into a lockdown, in some countries, its impact seems to be less deadly than in others.\\n\\nMany observers have been left startled comparing death rates in some of the most developed economies of the world, including Europe and the United States, with those being witnessed in the much less developed countries of South Asia and Africa – where the health systems are also fragile in contrast.\\n\\nAccording to the latest figures on the Covid-19 fatalities recorded by John Hopkins, out of the 82,992 deaths recorded worldwide, more than 41,000 have been from Italy, US and Spain combined.\\n\\nMeanwhile, only 222 people have died in India and Pakistan, while no deaths have been recorded in Nigeria or Kenya.\\n\\nSince its first Covid-19 case emerged on Feb 26, Pakistan has recorded 60 deaths and nearly 4,200 cases as of April 8.\\n\\nA preliminary study, or an analysis as some have called it, by researchers in New York, released on medRxiv – a site for unpublished medical research – argues there may be a link between countries that mandate the bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, also known as the TB vaccine, and lower mortality and morbidity rates.\\n\\nThe study, which is currently being formally peer reviewed, proposes the idea by noting that in countries most affected by Covid-19, including Italy, Netherlands and the United States, the BCG vaccine is not compulsory.\\n\\nIt further says that in Iran, where the BCG universal policy was adopted in 1984, several people had died from the virus thus supporting the idea that the older generation, that had not been vaccinated in childhood, was deprived of the protection it offers.\\n\\nThe study thus concludes that countries which did not implement or had abandoned universal BCG vaccination, which mostly include western countries, had more coronavirus infections per capita and higher death rates.\\n\\nIn Pakistan, like in many other developing nations, the BCG vaccine is compulsory for infants. According to the government\\'s Expanded Programme on Immunisation, since 1949, all newborns in Pakistan are given a single dose of the BCG vaccine at birth.\\n\\nThe BCG vaccine was first administered and then used widely after the first world war, around 1921. Other than its effectiveness in preventing tuberculosis, scientists say it also helps with other respiratory illnesses, certain bladder cancers, and could protect against asthma and autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes.\\n\\nAfter these initial findings on lower Covid-19 deaths in countries with universal BCG programmes, researchers at the University of Texas did a more comprehensive statistical study – trying to reduce the possibility of error – analysing data from 178 countries. They found that in countries with BCG vaccination programmes, the death rate was 4.28 per million while countries without such programmes faced 40 deaths per million.\\n\\nBut while these numbers are telling and do give hope, experts remain cautious on the potential of the BCG to provide protection. That is because these are only preliminary correlation studies at this point, and do not show a direct causal effect.\\n\\nTalking to Dawn.com, Associate Professor of Paediatrics at a Karachi varsity, Dr Neel Kanth says these studies were not \"evidence-based\" and were only \"observatory in nature\". According to him, there can be a host of confounding factors that may have caused fewer deaths in these countries.\\n\\nDr Kanth says while it is true that many countries, such as Pakistan, were not witnessing high enough mortality rates compared to Italy or the US, \"at this point we cannot say with certainty if the BCG vaccine programme has caused that.\"\\n\\n\"It may be true but we need to see evidence for that before being certain,\" he said, adding that \"there could be other reasons such as an overall higher immunity rate in certain populations (which are generally more unhygienic), climate and temperature effects in those countries and several other variables. We don\\'t know right now.\"\\n\\nBut at a time when the world is desperately searching for a way out, these observations are reason enough for many scientists to begin clinical and human trials to explore whether this vaccine can help in the crisis mankind is facing today.\\n\\nThey want to test whether the tuberculosis vaccine could have a similar effect against the new coronavirus, either by reducing the risk of being infected, or by limiting the severity of the symptoms.\\n\\nTrials begin\\n\\nFrance\\n\\n\"We have known for decades that BCG has non-specific beneficial effects\", in that it protects against diseases other than the one for which it was created, Camille Locht, of the French public health research institute Inserm, told AFP.\\n\\nIn France, where the BCG vaccine was compulsory until 2007, \"most of the study participants will have already had a first vaccination\", but the protective effect of this decreases over time, said Locht.\\n\\nBecause healthcare workers are on the front lines of the efforts to tackle COVID-19, they should be the \"first target\" if there is any benefit found with the BCG vaccine, said Locht, who is finalising details for a clinical trial in France.\\n\\nNetherlands\\n\\n\"That is exactly the reason for this research,\" says Mihai Netea, professor of experimental internal medicine at Radboud University in the Netherlands, which recently announced a clinical trial, with the University of Utrecht involving hundreds of healthcare workers.\\n\\nThis will see 500 medical professionals receive the BCG jab and 500 get a placebo.\\n\\n\"If during this epidemic fewer people in the BCG-vaccinated group would drop out due to illness, this would be an encouraging result,\" added Netea, a specialist in \"trained immunity\".\\n\\nThis is a relatively new concept based on the discovery that our innate immune response — the body\\'s generalised defences — also has a memory, alongside the acquired immunity, which develops antibodies after coming into contact with a specific pathogen.\\n\\nThe BCG vaccine does not directly protect against the coronavirus, but provides a boost to the immune system which may lead to improved protection and a milder infection, Radboud university said of the study.\\n\\nThe idea is that the innate immune system can be prepared, or \"trained\" to better combat attacks, thanks in particular to live attenuated vaccines, such as BCG or measles, which contained a weakened sliver of the original pathogen.\\n\\nIn the case of COVID-19, in addition to infection by the virus itself, some patients have also suffered excessive immune responses, with the uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory proteins, cytokines.\\n\\n\"Vaccination, in particular against BCG, might help to better orchestrate this inflammatory immune response,\" said Laurent Lagrost, Inserm research director who works on links between inflammation and the immune system.\\n\\nThe vaccine acts as a \"military exercise in peacetime\" so that the body can \"fight the enemy effectively in wartime,\" he said in an interview this week with French broadcaster BFMTV.\\n\\nAustralia, Spain\\n\\nA separate trial of the BCG vaccine has also been launched in Australia, with some 4,000 health workers, by the Murdoch Children\\'s Research Institute.\\n\\nMicrobiologist Locht wants to harmonise the criteria of the French study with that planned in four Spanish hospitals, in order to better compare their results.\\n\\nHowever, researchers in Spain, instead of using the BCG, would like to try a new tuberculosis vaccine developed by the biotech firm Biofabri.\\n\\nThis vaccine candidate, whose safety has already been demonstrated, should offer \"better protection\", said Carlos Martin, professor of microbiology at the University of Zaragoza, because it is \"developed from a strain isolated in humans\".\\n\\nIn contrast, he said the BCG is prepared from a strain of the bacteria that infects cattle, and two genes very important to the virulence of tuberculosis have been deactivated in the vaccine candidate.\\n\\nAnother advantage of the new vaccine is that it is made in Europe and could be quickly made available, while the BCG suffers from strong supply tensions and using it for adults against Covid-19 could deprive children of it in countries where tuberculosis remains endemic.\\n\\nGermany\\n\\nIn Germany, the Max Planck Institute for Infectious Biology is also preparing a trial with a genetically-modified vaccine candidate, developed by the Serum Institute of India.\\n\\nIn coordination with these countries, Inserm announced on Thursday that clinical trials could also be launched in Africa, where health systems are expected to come under acute pressure from the coronavirus pandemic.',\n",
