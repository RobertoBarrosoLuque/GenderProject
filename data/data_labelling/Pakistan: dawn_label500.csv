https://www.dawn.com/news/1586630,10/23/20 19:29,"Karachi court issues warrants for cleric, others in case involving rape, abduction and illicit marriage of minor girl","A Karachi court has taken cognisance of the marriage of an underage Christian girl, who was allegedly abducted and raped after being forcibly converted to Islam, it emerged on Friday.

The judge issued bailable warrants for the arrest of cleric Qazi Mufti Ahmed Jaan Raheemi — who allegedly performed the marriage of the girl when she was a teenager, her husband Muhammad Imran and his relatives Muhammad Rehan Baloch, Sundus and Azra. The suspects will be able to secure bail against a surety of Rs10,000 each, according to the judgement.

Police had booked five suspects, including two women, in a case pertaining to the alleged abduction and rape of the girl in Ittehad Town locality. The main suspect, Imran, was subsequently arrested.

The court's order came after the victim lodged a complaint against the suspects — including Imran, Baloch, Sundus, Azra and Raheemi — under Sections 3 (punishment for male contracting party), 4 (punishment for solemnising a child marriage) and 5 (punishment for parent or guardian concerned in a child marriage) of the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act, 2013.

The matter came up before judicial magistrate (West) Wajid Ali Channa, who observed that the victim had recorded her statement under Section 200 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) while the statements of the witnesses had also been recorded in the case.

The judge noted that the statements of the witnesses duly supported the complainant's statement. “On careful examination of the statements recorded during preliminary inquiry, it appears that the complainant in her statement stated that she is less than 13 years [old] and she was not willing in the nikah with the accused Muhammad Imran.”

He further noted that the “nikah was solemnised without her consent under pressure, coercion and influence. Hence [...] the offence under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act, 2013, read with Section 200 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, is prima facie made out against the accused persons namely Muhammad Imran, Muhammad Rehan, Mst Sundus, Mst Azra and Qazi Mufti Ahmed Jaan Raheemi.”

The judge further observed that under the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act, 2013, the marriage of either party who is less than 18 years old is prohibited. ""In the circumstances, cognisance of the offence under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act, 2013, is hereby taken. Let the private complaint be admitted and brought on regular file and registered,” he ordered.

The judge directed the court office to issue bailable warrants for the arrest of the suspects and directed the suspects to ensure their presence before the court on October 26.

The complainant was told to file a list of the witnesses and obtain certified copies of their statements. The court asked the office to also provide copies of the documentary evidence to the suspects by the next date of the hearing.

Case history

In May 2019, three of the five suspects in the cases had easily escaped from the court after an additional district and sessions judge recalled the pre-arrest bail granted to them against a surety of Rs30,000 each.

The judge had noted at the time that according to the case record, the complainant was a minor. Recording her statement before the judicial magistrate, the victim had denied accepting Islam and execution of her free will in performing her nikah with suspect Imran.

The judge further stated that “she deposed that they (suspects) forcibly obtained her signatures on plain papers and the co-accused committed zina with her.”

Initially, a case was registered under Sections 365-B (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel for marriage etc), 376 (punishment for rape), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Ittehad Town police station on the complaint of the victim.","['Naeem Sahoutara', 'Niamet Ladak', 'A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1421360,7/20/18 21:01,Man kills brother over 'honour' in Karachi,"A youth was murdered allegedly by his brother in Karachi's Ittehad Town on Friday, in what police suspect is a case of 'honour killing'.

According to police, the suspect stabbed to death his 24-year-old brother, Kashif, inside their home in Block 2 of Abidabad. The suspect managed to flee the crime scene but was later arrested by police.

While in custody, the man told the police that he killed his brother as he (Kashif) allegedly had ""illicit relations"" with his wife, a police officer told Dawn.

The police have registered a murder case against the suspect following a complaint filed by the third brother, Majid.

Honour killings continue despite new law

Scores of people in Pakistan, an overwhelming majority of whom are women, are still being murdered by relatives for bringing 'shame' on their family, more than a year since new laws came into force aimed at stemming the menace of 'honour killings'.

In October 2016, a joint sitting of both houses of parliament passed two key pro-women bills that had been pending assent for a long time.

The move at that time was cautiously hailed by women's rights activists. More than a year on, however, lawyers and activists say honour killings are still occurring at an alarming pace.

At least 280 such murders were recorded by the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan from October 2016 to June 2017 ─ a figure believed to be understated and incomplete.

The legislation mandates life imprisonment for honour killings, but whether a murder can be defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge's discretion.

That means the culprits can simply claim another motive and still be pardoned, according to Dr Farzana Bari, a widely respected activist and head of the Gender Studies Department at Islamabad's Quaid-i-Azam University.","['Imtiaz Ali', 'Philosopher', 'From Japan', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1206329,9/11/15 17:20,A 7-step guide for Pakistani victims of hacking and blackmail,"Pakistan has the highest teledensity (75 per cent) in the region and the cheapest rates for radio internet to have ever been offered (3G/4G LTE Data Plans for as low as $5/10GB). With over 40 million smartphone users, a very healthy chunk of the population is virtually online.

On the one hand, this is indeed a good omen, but on other, it also provides the rotten ones among us with easy and swift access to high speed internet, thus enabling them to carry out their activities with ease and impunity.

And as always, it is largely women who are at the receiving end.

If mobility and other restrictions weren’t enough, online space too, is now gradually becoming a forbidden entity for Pakistani women; in fact, to some extent, it has already.

The modus operandi of the proverbial rotten bunch is pretty basic – they set up multiple digital identities that allow them to collect personal information, mainly of women, in order to harass them online and in the real world.

A growing grey-to-black market of cheap and accessible software and hardware, furthermore, allows anyone to infiltrate mobile devices and computers, in order to track someone's social movements.

Needless to say, this places people, especially women, at great risk.

7 measures you can take to protect yourself

Here are the seven of the most efficient practices that a user should follow to a) avoid chances of harassment through the use of personal data, and b) take appropriate counteraction in case of being harassed online.

1. Choose strong passwords and change them regularly

Never discount the importance of password strength. Also, enable a two-step verification on all the online platforms that offer this feature (Facebook, Twitter and Gmail do); it serves as a crucial second line of defense in saving your online accounts if the hacker has successfully cracked your password.

As soon as you feel someone has used your account, change the passwords for all your accounts, not just the one that was hacked. Otherwise, it’s very easy for the hacker to follow a password pattern and get into your other accounts as well. You can somewhat avoid this by having very different passwords for each account.

2. Report to the authorities immediately

Once you have changed the passwords, report the hacking of your account to the relevant site. If you are unable to get back the control of your account, this will become even more important. All the larger websites normally do respond swiftly.

3. Alert family and friends

After reporting, it may take the site a little time before you get a response. Try to contact your family and friends to let them know of this occurrence so that they don’t communicate with your hacked account.

It is very Important to inform your family members, including your parents and guardians, of this, especially if you believe things could go awry later on. Having your family’s confidence before things take the wrong turn is crucial.

4. Do not cede to the blackmailer's demands

If the harassment has turned into blackmailing and the hacker is demanding money or anything else in return of your private data, do not hand over the money. Do not give in.

There is a high probability that they will try to blackmail you again, and you can never be sure that they have deleted all the copies of your private data.

5. Report the harassment to FIA — they are highly active

In case of cyber harassment or blackmailing, report to Federal Investigation Agency’s National Response Centre for Cybercrime. You will need to give them your details, as the NR3C doesn’t accept anonymous reports for obvious reasons.

This is a must, as you would want to have an official complaint lodged against the criminal. FIA’s NR3C department is very active and prompt in dealing with such cyber crimes, and will possibly be the best agency that can help. [FIA's helpline: 9911]

5.1 In case you are a minor, ask your guardian to lodge the complaint on your behalf. You can also get help from friends or teachers who can lodge a report on your behalf, if you don’t want to involve your family. 5.2 Remember, reporting the crime isn’t only important to safeguard yourself against future harassment – it will ensure that no one else is subjected to the troubles you endured. 5.3 You can report the cyber crime by either filling the online form or sending them an email with all the required information along with the evidence of harassment (screenshots of conversation or logs of e-mails) to this e-mail ID: Helpdesk@Nr3c.Gov.Pk 5.4 It is also important to note that threatening calls do not come under the mandate of Nr3c. To address this issue, one needs to lodge a complaint to your nearest police station.

6. If your friend is a victim, extend support

For peers of the victim, it is essential to support the victim of cyber crimes, as most don’t receive support from their family while going through the trauma of cyber harassment.

For the victim: if you cannot take your family in confidence in case of blackmailing, contact your friends or anyone else in your support system. You will probably find someone who will be able to help you with correct guidance and support.

7. Try to locate the attacker if possible

Family and peers also need to help the victim reach out to the authorities of the university, college, workplace, or any other institution which you think the attacker belongs to. As victims are usually terrified in these situations, it is important for peers and the family to take charge and report to any official agencies and places where the hacker(s) works at, if known.

In case you need further information or assistance, you can always refer to the Hamara Internet website. It has a knowledge base on how to deal with online harassment.

Hamara Internet is part of a Pakistani campaign initiated by the Digital Rights Foundation, which aims to protect Pakistani women against cyber harassment and promote a better understanding of using secure internet and mobile technologies.

The lack of support and a belief that they will be unsafe if they speak out, impacts the already small portion of the female Pakistani population that has access to the internet, as families will often try to restrict further access, once these cases are reported.

Access to the internet has become vitally important for women, not just in Pakistan but around the world, as a means of expressing themselves freely, and to also seek out educational and economic opportunities.

To deny or discourage Pakistani women from gaining access to the empowering platform of the internet is something that the country cannot afford. It is essential that the government and civil society work together to raise awareness about digital security amongst the general populace, with a focus on strengthening the legal support framework against cyber-crime.

However, rather than implementing vaguely-defined legislation with lots of loopholes and room for abuse; and that can see minors as young as 10 years old being prosecuted, the government and civil society must work on massive awareness initiatives and legal remedies that are proactive and provide safety, support and confidence to victims.

The capacity to tackle and solve the problem of cyber-crime and cyber-harassment in all their forms must be built upon strong foundations, if we are to deal with cyber-crimes in their infancy.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1272833,7/24/16 6:49,Loopholes persist in 'honour killing' bill,"ISLAMABAD: The proposed legislation on honour killings has introduced strict punishment for the convicts making it tougher than the ordinary murder cases.

However, legal experts are of the view that after killing a relative in the name of honour, a person may declare it a simple murder to avoid the punishment.

Under the existing law, a murderer can be released after the legal heirs pardon him. But the proposed legislation on honour killings recommends 25 years’ imprisonment even if the heirs of the victim pardon the convict. Under Section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), the convict in a simple murder case may get the life imprisonment of 14 years or a maximum of the death penalty.

Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, a criminal law expert and the president of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association, said the legislation on honour killings would not achieve the desired results as the accused may claim that he had committed the murder for other reasons such as a dispute over property etc. Hence, he may be charged with Section 302 of the PPC and the family members may pardon him under Section 309 of the PPC.

Experts suggest amending law of evidence, put onus on judges

Moreover, in honour killing cases the police as well as the courts follow the same procedure and rely on the same evidence as they would require in ordinary murder cases.

The collection of evidence in honour killing cases is very difficult and this is the reason a person after killing his daughter, sister or mother cannot be convicted, he said.

He suggested that the lawmakers should amend Qanoon-i-Shahadat (the law of evidence) for honour killing cases and the standard of evidence should be relaxed which would increase the possibility of conviction.

Instead of direct evidence – testimonies of the witnesses – reliance should be made on the circumstantial evidence which may be the electronic evidence or other related facts.

The Anti-Honour Killings Laws (Criminal Laws Amendment) Bill 2015 and the Anti-Rape Laws (Criminal Laws Amendment) Bill 2015, initially moved by former senator of the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Sughra Imam as private members’ bills, were passed by the Senate two years ago.

But the government failed to get the bills passed by the National Assembly within the stipulated 90 days and later had to include them on the agenda of a joint sitting of parliament, which had actually been convened to get the PIA conversion bill passed.

The honour killings bill aims at preventing killing of women in the name of honour by making the crime a non-compoundable offence.

When contacted, Senator Saeed Ghani, who was a member of the committee which cleared the bill, told Dawn that honour killings had certain distinctions. He explained that in a simple murder case the deceased may not be a family member.

The investigation officer may ascertain whether the murder was honour killing or otherwise, he said.

Barrister Zafarullah Khan, the special assistant to the prime minister who headed the government legal team which drafted the law, said it was the responsibility of the court to make a distinction between a simple murder and an honour killing.

He said: “The judge will decide whether it is a simple murder or a murder in the name of honour.”

Shaukat Rauf contended that he had been terminated without being given an opportunity of defence merely on a complaint lodged by a fellow teacher. The petitioner said he was a true Muslim having firm believe in finality of prophethood of Muhammad (PBUH) and had PhD degree in Islamiat.

He pleaded that his point of view was not heard by the authorities in a departmental inquiry, which was in sheer violation of fundamental right of fair trial.

He said the court had directed the respondent secretary to decide his departmental appeal against the termination but the order had not been complied.

The petitioner said the secretary committed contempt of court by not implementing the order and was liable to be punished under the relevant law.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1576123/alleged-killer-of-11-family-members-in-pannu-aqil-turns-out-to-be-religious-fanatic,8/24/20 6:30,Alleged killer of 11 family members in Pannu Aqil turns out to be religious fanatic,"SUKKUR: Wahabullah Indher — the man who allegedly slaughtered 11 members of his immediate family within his house in Maulvi Mohammad Saleh Indhar village, located near Pannu Aqil, during the night intervening Aug 18 and 19 — appeared to be a religious fanatic as he confessed to have “offered the sacrifice” to please Almighty Allah.

He kept repeating his statement before police since his arrest, in Adilpur town of Ghotki district, on Aug 19. Currently on a 14-day police remand, Wahabullah was quoted as claiming that he and his adult children had received an edict from Almighty Allah through a “same dream” asking them to offer the sacrifice in order to avert a “disaster looming large on us”.

Brother claims area police conducted four raids on house but could not rescue victims

Indhar had seven sons and four daughters. He said he and his [surviving] sons sacrificed his three younger sons — Mahmood Ahsan, 4, Mahmood Asad, 3, and a newborn — and the daughters — Iqra, 18, Isra, 8, Sobia, 6, and Hajani, 5 — with a dagger (which has been taken into custody the police). The others slain by the suspects were Wahabullah’s wife, Ruqayya, 42, his eldest son Habibullah’s pregnant wife, Naseema, 19/21, and their two children, Nazia, 3, and one-year-old Ali Sher. Habibullah and his three brothers, Hizbullah, Kaleemullah and Majid, are in police custody for their alleged complicity in the gruesome offence. According to Wahabullah, he killed his wife and Naseema and the rest were killed by his three surviving sons. Majid was not accompanying him when the arrests were made. He was taken into custody the next day.

Although Wahabullah appeared happy and satisfied over the horrible act, his estranged brother, Mian Asad, revealed startling facts about the whole episode and accused the area police of not daring to “rescue the victims despite making no less than four attempts”.

Speaking to local reporters, Mian Asad said he was alarmed when came to know that Wahabullah and his sons were on their way to Adilpur [on Aug 19] and alerted the police. He said he knew that they intended to kill a daughter of his [Asad’s] former (divorced) wife. He said his former wife’s family and the area police were timely alerted and the suspects were nabbed.

Mian Asad also revealed that the Cantonment police of Pannu Aqil were approached many days before the incident with plea to rescue the “hostages” who had been confined to the house for one week and nobody was allowed to enter the house. He said Wahabullah had a pistol and he kept threatening the inmates as well as any visitor trying to go inside.

He said the police made four attempts, the last one a day before the incident, during the week but never dared to lay hands on Wahabullah, who every time threatened to shoot anyone trying to enter the house. He wondered why the police could not realise gravity of the situation despite being alerted about the lives of a large number innocent persons being in danger.

According to Mian Asad, Wahabullah’s neighbours stated that the suspects kept reciting some strange rhymes and playing music by beating some mettle pots on the fateful night but all this stopped at around midnight.

Meanwhile, Sukkur DIG Fida Hussain Mastoi told the media on Sunday that a thorough investigation into the incident was under way and the suspects were being interrogated. He said an inquiry into the role of the area police was also being conducted and departmental action would be taken if negligence was proved.

Regarding a post-mortem examination of the victims, Pannu Aqil taluka Hospital medical superintendent Salahuddin Ujjan said there was no evidence suggesting that any of the deceased was drugged before being killed.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1425813,8/9/18 6:53,Karachi police chief sent packing after officials found involved in witnesses’ harassment,"KARACHI: Inspector General of Police, Sindh, Amjad Javed Saleemi on Wednesday removed Karachi police chief Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar and posted Additional IG Dr Amir Ahmed Shaikh in his place.

The decision came amid reports that powerful quarters were unhappy over the role of Karachi police in an FIA-mandated money laundering case against Pakistan Peoples Party co-chairman Asif Zardari, his sister Faryal Talpur and many others.

New Karachi police chief Dr. Amir Ahmed Shaikh.

Besides some junior police officials, another senior officer, SSP East Mohammad Nauman Siddiqui, was also transferred by the IGP.

While officials remained tight-lipped over the development, sources at the Central Police Office (CPO) said that the action was taken in the light of the findings of a probe carried out on the directives of the Supreme Court.

On Aug 6, a three-judge SC bench headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar had taken up a suo motu case regarding fake accounts involving Rs35bn alleged money laundering. During the hearing, the FIA director general alleged that the Sindh police were harassing witnesses. The apex court ordered IG Saleemi to look into the matter and furnish a report.

Some officials say Mushtaq Mahar was ‘punished’ for political reasons; Amir Shaikh new police chief

The sources said that the IGP asked Additional IG Dr Aftab Pathan to conduct an inquiry into the allegations of harassment against policemen.

They said several policemen appeared before the inquiry officer at the CPO and ‘admitted’ that they stayed at the house of a woman, who is a witness in the money laundering case, for up to six hours, contradicting the account of a senior police officer who told the IGP that the police stayed for merely “10 to 15 minutes” at her house in Gulistan-i-Jauhar to serve the summons.

The sources said that the IGP expressed his extreme displeasure against the senior police officer for ‘covering up’ the incident.

AIG Mahar says he requested for transfer

While Mr Mahar had just completed his three-year term as the Karachi police chief, on Wednesday the IGP transferred him and posted Additional IG finance, logistics and welfare Amir Ahmed Shaikh in his place.

Mr Mahar told Dawn that he had already completed his three-year tenure as the Karachi police chief and only two days after the general elections he asked the IGP and the Sindh government to transfer him.

He was appointed in July 2015 as the city police chief. Two years later, he was transferred and posted as city traffic police chief. But he returned to his previous post in just five weeks.

A notification issued by the IG reads: “In exercise of the authority conferred vide para 96(c) of the judgement of Honourable High Court of Sindh dated Sept. 7, 2017 in C.P. (No. D-7097 of 2016 and C.P. D-131 of 2017), Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar, a PSP (BS-21), additional inspector general of police, Karachi range is transferred and directed to report to Central Police Office Sindh, Karachi.”

Another notification stated that Dr Amir Ahmed Shaikh — a PSP officer (BS-21) — was posted with immediate effect and until further orders as the Karachi police chief.

SSP East Nauman Siddiqui, a PSP officer (BS-19), was also transferred and directed to report to the CPO through another notification. Shikarpur SSP Jahanzeb Nazir Khan was transferred and posted as the new SSP East.

Controversy

However, controversy surrounded the IGP’s decision to send Mr Mahar, an officer of good repute, packing as those against the decision found it politically motivated.

They said that Mr Mahar was punished only for performing his duties as a police team had served notices at the houses of the suspects facing the Rs35bn money laundering case.

They added that the FIA did not have required force and they merely pasted notices/summons at the Bilawal House in Clifton and Ms Talpur’s house in Defence and just took its pictures.

They said that in compliance with the SC directions, the Gulistan-i-Jauhar and Gizri police forcefully served the summons to ensure their appearance in court in Islamabad in the case.

However, a senior police officer conceded that the police might “overdo” things in order to ensure compliance of the apex court’s order.

The senior officer said that instead of transferring the Karachi police chief an FIR could have been registered against such policemen for harassment.

He said senior police officials ‘resisted’ action against their junior fellows who were merely complying with the SC orders.

Meanwhile, the newly appointed city police chief said curbing street crimes and improving emergency response of the police to address citizens’ complaints would be some of his top priorities.

The senior officer said that instead of transferring the Karachi police chief an FIR could have been registered against such policemen for harassment.","['witnesses', 'senior', 'harassment', 'officer', 'sent', 'karachi', 'chief', 'transferred', 'involved', 'mahar', 'igp', 'ahmed', 'sindh', 'officials', 'packing', 'posted']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189f00b83e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0d52ba8a43.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/07/596d81454b9b8.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2018/08/5b6bbf7b4dbef.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2017/08/599ea42879c2a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/08/599ea42879c2a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2018/08/5b6ad489753f5.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21824a8678.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189916390d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2017/07/596d81454b9b8.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0ec56aad75.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd22283a73d3.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18a3ece187.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2018/08/5b6bbf7b4dbef.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f94d8916a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f4142e469.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24c3aad888.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2018/08/5b6bbc48bc66a.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24e90196c5.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2018/08/5b6bbc48bc66a.png,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Some officials say Mushtaq Mahar was ‘punished’ for political reasons; Amir Shaikh new police chief.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1425813', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Karachi police chief sent packing after officials found involved in witnesses’ harassment', 'description': 'Some officials say Mushtaq Mahar was ‘punished’ for political reasons; Amir Shaikh new police chief.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2018/08/5b6bbc48bc66a.png'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1425813', 'title': 'Karachi police chief sent packing after officials found involved in witnesses’ harassment', 'description': 'Some officials say Mushtaq Mahar was ‘punished’ for political reasons; Amir Shaikh new police chief.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2018/08/5b6bbc48bc66a.png'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2018-08-09 06:53:25', 'modified_time': '2018-08-09 09:14:08', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/1200/imtiaz-ali'}, 'author': 'Imtiaz Ali'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1508076,9/30/19 6:54,"50 women, 28 men fall victim to karo-kari across Sindh in six months","KARACHI: Amid so many challenges faced by the law enforcement agencies and the criminal justice system, killings in the name of so-called honour, or karo-kari killings, mainly in rural parts of Sindh, continue unabated as more than 70 people have lost their lives during the first six months of the current year, it emerged on Sunday.

However, investigations into majority of such cases remain inconclusive bringing no one to justice but have allowed acquittal of a few suspects.

Official figures suggested that some 78 people were killed from January to June 2019 in different parts of Sindh in the name of karo-kari leading to registration of 65 cases. However, more than 90 per cent cases were pending trial due to different reasons and in most cases the police probe had not reached to a conclusion.

Total 65 cases have been registered but no one convicted for killing in the name of so-called honour

“Among 78 victims, 50 were women and 28 men,” said a source citing the data. “Total 65 FIRs have been registered in different parts of Sindh for honour killings and charge sheets in 60 cases filed. Some 57 cases are still pending with no conviction in any case. However, three people have been acquitted during the process. In most cases the suspects are close relatives of the victims.”

The concern in the police hierarchy over the status of investigations into honour killing cases echoed in a recent meeting chaired by Inspector General of Police Dr Syed Kaleem Imam, who last month reviewed the progress made by police in their assignments related to karo-kari.

IGP seeks detailed report

The Sindh IG had asked investigators to prepare a detailed report on a case-to-case basis about the release and conviction in the honour killing cases across the province.

He also directed the officials concerned to ensure that there must not be any loophole left in the investigations and the same was also adequately pursued before courts.

In the same meeting, the DIG-Sukkur was asked to take on board all stakeholders and with their consultation a proposal be developed to help end the menace of karo-kari.

Despite being highly criticised by the authorities as well as human rights organisations, the heinous trend, usually termed a part of the rural system, continues unabated. Police, however, find it hard to investigate such killings effectively, as both aggrieved and accused parties usually belong to the same family or tribe.

“Honour killing is a social problem and has its roots in the tribal culture and a mindset where women are seen as subservient to men,” said DIG-Headquarters Abdul Khaliq Shaikh.

DIG Shaikh has been heading the recently established human rights cell of the Sindh police that operates as a supervisory body responsible for focusing and emphasising safeguarding human rights while primarily dealing with cases pertaining to vulnerable communities that include women, children, minorities and transgenders.

“A long-term solution lies in changing this mindset and empowering women in society in general. As far as the criminal justice response is concerned the police department has taken several useful initiatives to deal with the menace of killings in the name of so-called honour which included execution of a project on prevention of honour killings in collaboration with UNDP and a training module for police officers have been developed to sensitise them,” he added.

He said that a centralised human rights cell had been established in the Central Police Office (CPO) to monitor such incidents or cases and the IGP had got conducted a research study by senior police officers to assess the police response and identify ways and means to improve police handling of cases.

“However, there’s a need for greater coordination between prosecution, police and judiciary as prosecutors and judges need to be trained to understand peculiarities of murder cases where motive is [so-called] honour,” said DIG Shaikh.

Call for reforming criminal justice system

Both human rights organisations and legislators, however, believe that apart from the flaw in the probe and attitude of the families concerned, the police’s approach towards the ‘honour killing’ cases and overall criminal justice system need reforms.

They call for greater reforms in the laws and bringing the culprits to justice instead of blaming the culture for the brutal trend.

“In the first place, you have to treat all crime equally — if its murder then its murder,” said PPP leader Dr Nafisa Shah, who has a PhD degree in social and cultural anthropology from Oxford University.

Ms Shah’s 2017 book Honour Unmasked offers rich detailed ethnography on honour killing, sowing how the state and justice system and informal processes of redress are mutually implicated in providing a space for honour-related violence.

“When it comes to law related to this subject, it’s unfortunate these laws are quite vague. They are needed to be reformed. We witnessed some legal changes first during General Musharraf government and then during the last government of Nawaz Sharif. But it needs to address whole criminal justice and one can’t blame culture or trend just for an excuse.”

She said that the changes made in the laws during two different government to address the menace of honour killings should be counted effective if there was any decline in number of such cases but this could only be called as a step forward, not a solution.

“Since all cases fall in the domain of law, we need to look at the perspective of the law,” said Dr Shah. “We need to see that how are these cases dealt with? Whatever changes were made in the law, I believe these all were partial changes. We need to look and reform the criminal justice system for better and effective results.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1526751,1/7/20 7:05,"PM wants massive drive against drugs, child abuse","PRIME Minister Imran Khan addresses the launching ceremony of Zindagi App on Monday.—PPI

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday urged the provinces and other stakeholders to combat the menace of drugs and child abuse by launching a massive countrywide campaign against them to protect the youth.

“Drug addiction among school going children and child abuse are two big issues confronting our society which need to be addressed through collaborated efforts of the government, provinces, Anti-Narcotic Force, police and teachers,” the prime minister said while launching a mobile application called “Zindagi” (life) which can be used for lodging complaints against drug abuse and creating awareness among parents and teachers about how to protect children from the menace.

“Our mosques and ulema should also play their role in eradicating these menaces. Ulema can create awareness among people about the growing use of drugs in educational institutions in their Friday sermons,” he added.

The prime minister said he had got separate briefings from inspectors general of police (IGs) of Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and was shocked to know that a new synthetic drug called “ice” was being used by the pupils of expensive and high-profile schools as they were more vulnerable to the drug. “Once they [schoolchildren] use ice they fall prey to other drugs as well. There was a time when we heard there were drugs in universities. Now drugs are present in schools,” he added.

Prime Minister Khan said powerful mafias were behind unbridled drug abuse in the country and they always kept themselves safe from any action of the police and drug controlling authorities because of their money. “On my directives a raid was conducted by the police in KP but the drug pushers had fled before the raid because someone in the police had already informed them about the police action.”

He regretted that Pakistan was among top countries where child pornography was on the higher side. “People don’t like to talk about this issue due to shame but our government raised it as a national issue because it is an epidemic. In both these matters [child and drug abuses], mobile phones have aggravated the situation. We have decided to combat both these issues on an emergency basis,” he added.

However, the prime minister stressed that controlling the two menaces could not be the responsibility of only the police or any single department, but the whole nation should be united to combat these issues.

He said the Zindagi App was an effort to raise awareness among the parents and teachers about the danger of drug abuse and how to tackle it.

The app features a complete collection of drug awareness, drug prevention and treatment, rehabs locations, success stories and supportive community to help and meditate drug victims. It can be downloaded from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

On the occasion, a book aimed at creating awareness about drugs was also launched. Prime Minister Khan emphasised the need for introducing the book in all schools to increase knowledge and awareness about the issue.

Students meet PM

Prime Minister Imran Khan said the present government was striving to introduce a uniform curriculum in the country so as to eliminate current education-based discrimination in society. He said promotion of human resource and development was a big challenge in the presence of three different education systems.

He was talking to a delegation of students from Business Administration Department of Virginia University, who were currently on a visit to Pakistan to have first-hand information about the potential of business and tourism in the country.

During the interactive meeting, matters relating to challenges faced by the country, reforms agenda of the present government, positive aspects of Pakistani society, existing potential of the country in diverse sectors, economic challenges and future strategy were discussed.

Prime Minister Khan said Pakistan was bestowed by Allah Almighty with abundant resources, but unfortunately development process in the country got stagnant due to corruption and neglect of human resource promotion by the previous governments. “Pakistan was the fastest developing country in South Asia in the decade of 1960s, but the political philosophies of the decades of 1970s and 1980s not only led to blocking of industrial development but also inclusion of money and corruption in politics,” he added.

Mr Khan said he was fighting against what he called “mafia” which had been creating hurdles in the way of country’s progress, adding that the challenge before him was not only the elimination of corruption but also improving the education system. He said the present government believed in the protection of minorities’ rights and deemed them equal citizens. “Our religion Islam and the teachings of the Father of Nation give us the lesson of protecting minorities’ rights.”

About current regional situation, the prime minister said the Indian government’s policies based on the philosophy of RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) posed serious threats to the regional peace. “Oppressive policies of the Indian government have endangered the identity of Indians themselves and identity and existence of 500 million minorities living in India,” he said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1571280,7/27/20 7:07,Government College University VC in Lahore orders probe into sexual harassment case,"LAHORE: Following a sexual harassment complaint made on behalf of a student against a teacher of Physics Department of the Government College University, Lahore, the vice chancellor ordered an inquiry into the matter on Sunday.

A member of the Old Ravian Facebook group had posted screenshots and pictures of a teacher of the GCU Physics Department, and alleged quoting a student that she and her friends were repeatedly failed by the teacher in examinations and were also sexually harassed by him.

According to the Facebook post, the group member said he decided to speak on behalf of the student who alleged the teacher wanted to remain in contact with her and her friends.

In the post the teacher was accused of compelling the students to attend his video calls. It said that on Saturday, the teacher called one of the students who “decided to expose him” and took some screenshots in which he was “shirtless and apparently drunk”.

It says when the student turned off her Wi-Fi after taking the screenshots, the teacher started making calls on her mobile number and had sent messages asking her to attend the call.

The post includes call logs, messages and screenshots of video calls, demanding the Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Asghar Zaidi to take notice of the incident.

Meanwhile, the vice chancellor Prof Zaidi also received complaints about a faculty member of the university making inappropriate calls and messages to a female student and ordered an inquiry into the matter. For the purpose, he constituted a committee that also included a woman member.

He said that as a matter of principle harassment would not be tolerated at the GCU.

Prof Zaidi said a web portal (Vice Chancellor web portal) had been created by varsity since February 2020 for filing such complaints by students and staff.

He said the university would not further comment on this matter till conclusion of the inquiry.

He directed the probe committee to maintain the confidentiality of the matter and provide full protection to the complainant.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1583767,10/7/20 20:03,Mirpur police arrest son of former AJK chief justice for allegedly harassing female doctor,"Police in Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s (AJK) Mirpur city arrested the son of a former chief justice of the AJK Supreme Court, Chaudhry Ibrahim Zia, for allegedly harassing a woman for the past two years in Muzaffarabad, it emerged on Wednesday.

The arrest of the suspect, Arsalan Zia, who is a BS-17 ad-hoc employee in the Information Technology section of the AJK high court, was made at around midnight on an application filed by the victim’s father — an advocate who hails from the Kotli district — at around 11:15pm on Tuesday.

According to the complaint, a copy of which is available with Dawn, the victim, who studied medicine in Muzaffarabad from 2014 to 2019, lived in a hostel that was owned by the suspect’s father and built largely on the course of a water channel near the prime minister’s house.

The complainant alleged that in December 2018, his daughter noticed that the suspect would covertly take pictures of female students from the roof of the hostel, which he would visit on the pretext of checking the building's maintenance.

“After some time, my daughter started receiving calls and messages from different numbers by the suspect who would ask her to maintain relations with him,” he alleged, adding that on her refusal, the suspect started threatening her while boasting about the position of his father — then the serving chief justice.

The suspect would also chase her to and from the two teaching hospitals in Muzaffarabad in official vehicles with impunity and force her to take a ride with him, the complainant said.

According to him, since the suspect worked in the IT section, he had also hacked his daughter's social media accounts and copied her pictures and personal information to blackmail her.

“At least twice, he tried to bundle my daughter in an official vehicle — once in Muzaffarabad and the next time in Rawalpindi — but failed after she raised a hue and cry,” he said.

The complainant further said that his daughter completed her medical education in April 2020 and started a house job in Mirpur, but the suspect continued to harass her.

The suspect had been in Mirpur for the past few days but on Monday, he arrived at the hospital and threatened the woman in the presence of a senior doctor with death if she did not accompany him to contract marriage, the victim's father said.

He said that he had rushed from Kotli to Mirpur when a senior doctor informed him about the incident, in order to lodge a complaint with the police.

“My daughter is in a state of shock and depression. I want strict legal action not only against this guy who is her known tormentor but also his hidden colleagues,” he concluded.

After registering a first information report under sections 489H, 489 ZXD, 501(2) of Penal Code and section 11 of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Act, Mirpur Police took the suspect into custody.

Police sources said they believed that it was not an isolated incident involving one particular individual but a group of people harassing and intimidating women.

Police will scrutinise mobile numbers in the use of the suspect as well as his social media accounts to gather more information about such elements, the sources said.

Meanwhile, a senior Mirpur-based journalist claimed that the former chief justice had contacted some senior police officials, complaining that harsh sections had been incorporated in the FIR against his son.

Despite repeated attempts to contact DIG Mirpur Sardar Ilyas Khan and SSP Raja Irfan Salim, they could not be reached for comment.","['Tariq Naqash', 'Ibrahim S', 'One Nation', 'Marquis De Sade', 'Tahir A', 'Salam Shahid', 'Zeeshan Ahmed', 'Mumtaz Ahmed Shah', 'Noor Ahmad', 'Islamabad Diaries']","Police in Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s (AJK) Mirpur city arrested the son of a former chief justice of the AJK Supreme Court, Chaudhry Ibrahim Zia, for allegedly harassing a woman for the past two years in Muzaffarabad, it emerged on Wednesday.

http://www.dawn.com/news/760438,10/31/12 7:29,Chinese think tank urges end to one-child policy,"“China has paid a huge political and social cost for the policy, as it has resulted in social conflict, high administrative costs and led indirectly to a long-term gender imbalance at birth,” Xinhua said, citing the report. — File Photo by Reuters

BEIJING: A Chinese government think tank is urging the country’s leaders to start phasing out its one-child policy immediately and allow two children for every family by 2015, a daring proposal to do away with the unpopular policy.

Some demographers see the timeline put forward by the China Development Research Foundation as a bold move by the body close to the central leadership. Others warn that the gradual approach, if implemented, would still be insufficient to help correct the problems that China’s strict birth limits have created.

Xie Meng, a press affairs official with the foundation, said the final version of the report wil be released “in a week or two.”

But Chinese state media have been given advance copies.

The official Xinhua News Agency said the foundation recommends a two-child policy in some provinces from this year and a nationwide two-child policy by 2015. It proposes all birth limits be dropped by 2020, Xinhua reported.

“China has paid a huge political and social cost for the policy, as it has resulted in social conflict, high administrative costs and led indirectly to a long-term gender imbalance at birth,” Xinhua said, citing the report.

But it remains unclear whether Chinese leaders are ready to take up the recommendations.

China’s National Population and Family Planning Commission had no immediate comment on the report Tuesday.

Known to many as the one-child policy, China’s actual rules are more complicated.

The government limits most urban couples to one child, and allows two children for rural families if their first-born is a girl.

There are numerous other exceptions as well, including looser rules for minority families and a two-child limit for parents who are themselves both singletons.

Cai Yong, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, said the report holds extra weight because the think tank is under the State Council, China’s Cabinet. He said he found it remarkable that state-backed demographers were willing to publicly propose such a detailed schedule and plan on how to get rid of China's birth limits.

“That tells us at least that policy change is inevitable, it's coming,” said Cai, who was not involved in the drafting of the report but knows many of the experts who were.

Cai is currently a visiting scholar at Fudan University in Shanghai. “It’s coming, but we cannot predict when exactly it will come.”

Adding to the uncertainty is a once-in-a-decade leadership transition that kicks off Nov 8 that will see a new slate of top leaders installed by next spring.

Cai said the transition could keep population reform on the back burner or changes might be rushed through to help burnish the reputations of President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao on their way out.

There has been growing speculation among Chinese media, experts and ordinary people about whether the government will soon relax the one-child policy, introduced in 1980 as a temporary measure to curb surging population growth, and allow more people to have two children.

Though the government credits the policy with preventing hundreds of millions of births and helping lift countless families out of poverty, it is reviled by many ordinary people. The strict limits have led to forced abortions and sterilizations, even though such measures are illegal. Couples who flout the rules face hefty fines, seizure of their property and loss of their jobs.

Many demographers argue that the policy has worsened the country’s aging crisis by limiting the size of the young labor pool that must support the large baby boom generation as it retires. They say it has contributed to the imbalanced sex ratio by encouraging families to abort baby girls, preferring to try for a male heir.

The government recognises those problems and has tried to address them by boosting social services for the elderly. It has also banned sex-selective abortion and rewarded rural families whose only child is a girl.

Many today also see the birth limits as outdated, a relic of the era when housing, jobs and food were provided by the state.

“It has been thirty years since our planned economy was liberalised,” commented Wang Yi, the owner of a shop that sells textiles online, under a news report on the foundation’s proposal.

“So why do we still have to plan our population?”

Though open debate about the policy has flourished in state media and on the Internet, leaders have so far expressed a desire to maintain the status quo.

President Hu said last year that China would keep its strict family planning policy to keep the birth rate low and other officials have said that no changes are expected until at least 2015.

Wang Feng, director of the Brookings-Tsinghua Center for Public Policy and an expert on China's demographics, contributed research material to the foundation’s report but has yet to see the full text. He said he welcomed the gist of the document that he’s seen in state media.","['Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

Police claimed to have arrested the suspects, all said to be the children of KU employees, and booked them for allegedly harassing female students on the campus.

On Friday, the investigating officer produced them before the judicial magistrate (East) to seek their physical remand for interrogation and investigation.

However, the suspects moved an application, through their defence counsel, seeking grant of post-arrest bail.

The defence counsel opposed the IO’s request for police remand stating that they were underage and the case against them was without any merits.

He asked the judge to grant them post-arrest bail.

After hearing arguments from the state prosecutor, the judge granted bail to the suspects against a surety of Rs20,000 each.

The judge turned down the IO’s request for remand of the suspects, who were told to cooperate with the police during the investigation of the case.

On Thursday, the varsity administration had handed over the suspects, said to be residents of KU’s staff town, to the Mobina Town police after some students of the Institute of Business Administration (IBA), which is located on the KU premises, complained on social media of an alleged harassment and intimidation incident on the campus.

The matter surfaced on the night between Wednesday and Thursday, when an IBA student, Syed Shaheer Ali, shared on Facebook that he was harassed in KU while he was returning after dropping one of the female students at the IBA Girls’ Hostel.

He alleged that around 10 young men, aged between 10 to 16 years, surrounded him on four motorcycles and harassed him.

Mr Ali said he dropped the female student at the Girls’ Hostel at around 11.30pm and then he along with a female friend headed towards Maskan, when 10 people on four motorcycles suddenly appeared and surrounded his car, shouting to get out of the vehicle.

The male student said it was pitch dark at KU, with complete silence and “we were stuck around the bushes. I tried my best to hold my nerves and pressed the accelerator to full as I tried to run away”, he wrote on social media.

“As we ran and reached near IBA Boys Hostel, they again appeared and surrounded us forcing me to stop the car. That’s when they came to the car’s window banging and screaming Larki ko Bahar nikaal, Gaari Roukk, Bahar aa... [take the girl out, stop the car, get off].”

However, Ali said he managed to escape and informed the security guards on the Maskan gate of the varsity.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1108900,5/27/14 18:04,Woman stoned to death outside Lahore High Court,"LAHORE: A 25-year-old woman was stoned to death by her family outside the Lahore High Court on Tuesday in a so-called “honour” killing for marrying the man she loved, police said.

Farzana Iqbal was waiting for the High Court in Lahore to open when a group of around dozen men began attacking her with bricks, said Umer Cheema, a senior police officer.

Her father, two brothers and former fiance were among the attackers, he said. Iqbal suffered severe head injuries and was pronounced dead in hospital, police said.

All the suspects except her father escaped. He admitted killing his daughter, Cheema said, and explained it was a matter of honour.

Cheema said Farzana had been engaged to her cousin but married another man. Her family registered a kidnapping case against him but Farzana had come to court to argue that she had married of her own free will, he said.

Arranged marriages are the norm among conservative Pakistanis, who view marriage for love as a transgression.

Around 1,000 Pakistani women are killed every year by their families in honour killings, according to Pakistani rights group the Aurat Foundation.

The true figure is probably many times higher since the Aurat Foundation only compiles figures from newspaper reports. The government does not compile national statistics.

Campaigners say few cases come to court, and those that do can take years to be heard. No one tracks how many cases are successfully prosecuted.

Even those that do result in a conviction may end with the killers walking free. Pakistani law allows a victim's family to forgive their killer.

But in honour killings, most of the time the women’s killers are her family, said Wasim Wagha of the Aurat Foundation. The law allows them to nominate someone to carry out the murder, then forgive him.

“This is a huge flaw in the law,” he said. “We are really struggling on this issue.”","['Raj Patel', 'Daniel Shiger', 'Amir Mahmood', 'Tahir A', 'Joe Fl', 'Irfan Husain', 'Ganga Din', 'Syed Fahad', 'Calcutta Man', 'Muhammed Ali']","LAHORE: A 25-year-old woman was stoned to death by her family outside the Lahore High Court on Tuesday in a so-called “honour” killing for marrying the man she loved, police said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1530860,1/27/20 23:26,Man arrested for allegedly raping minor girl in Muzaffarabad,"A 23-year-old man was arrested and booked by the police on Monday for allegedly raping a minor girl in a peripheral village of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) capital, Muzaffarabad.

The alleged rape occurred in Majhotar Kelgran village in the jurisdiction of Panjgran police station on Friday evening shortly after the 12-year-old victim had entered her family's byre to tether a goat, said Station House Officer (SHO) Mir Muzammil.

Panjgran is located around 35 kilometres northeast of Muzaffarabad along the main Neelum valley road on the left bank of River Neelum, while Majhotar Kelgran village is located across the river.

The SHO said that the suspect, who lived next door to the victim’s house, followed the victim into the byre and raped her there.

The victim, according to her statement to the police, resisted and shouted but there was no one to rescue her, as her mother was not at home at the time.

The suspect threatened to kill her if she narrated the incident to anyone, the SHO said, quoting her statement.

According to SHO Muzammil, on seeing the victim in pain the following evening, her mother inquired the reason and came to know about her ordeal.

“They are a very poor family. The victim’s father is doing some odd job in Karachi and her elder teenaged brother studies in a college in Muzaffarabad,” the SHO said.

“Perhaps they were [initially] reluctant to visit a police station but did it on Monday on the insistence or suggestion of some people from their biradri (clan) or village … I consoled and assured them that police would do their best to dispense justice to them,” he added.

The SHO said the suspect was arrested from his village after police recorded the statement(s) of the victim and her mother.

“The suspect, on coming to know about the police raid, went into hiding and his family also tried to resist his arrest but we got hold of him,” he said.

On Monday afternoon, police official Chanzeb Kiani brought the victim to Shaikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahayan Hospital Muzaffarabad for medical examination which, according to a provisional report, established that she had been sexually assaulted.

“She is in severe pain,” Kiani told Dawn from the hospital.

SHO Muzammil said the suspect, who had quit school in grade V, had memorised the Holy Quran from a seminary in Bahria Town Islamabad and was acquiring religious education from a seminary in Karachi for the past six years.

He had come home around two months ago and was attending to his father’s small shop alongside their home.

The SHO said although the suspect had denied having committed any such offence, preliminary grilling substantiated that he was foreswearing.

He added that the police had registered an FIR against him on the basis of the provisional medical report.

“We have booked him under Section 10(2) of the Zina Act and Section 452 of the Criminal Procedure Code and will produce him before a judicial magistrate on Tuesday for his physical remand,” he said.","['Tariq Naqash', 'Gul Hasan', 'Naseem Altaf', 'Ibrahim S', 'Images Staff', 'Khurram Husain', 'F.S.

The SHO said although the suspect had denied having committed any such offence, preliminary grilling substantiated that he was foreswearing.","['minor', 'arrested', 'pain', 'man', 'muzaffarabad', 'raping', 'girl', 'village', 'suspect', 'provisional', 'station', 'sho', 'seminary', 'victims', 'allegedly', 'victim']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/11/5dd8bafd66a3e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189f00b83e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0d52ba8a43.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/11/5dc2400e1a672.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/09/5d845e84abd85.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/01/5e2f2b332a8e2.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/09/5d845e84abd85.jpg?r=560419867', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/11/5dd8bafd66a3e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/11/5dc2400e1a672.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21824a8678.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189916390d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0ec56aad75.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/01/5e2f2b332a8e2.jpg?r=1278650507', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd22283a73d3.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18a3ece187.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f94d8916a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f4142e469.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24c3aad888.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24e90196c5.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/01/5e2f2b332a8e2.jpg?r=1278650507,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'The suspect is a student at a seminary in Karachi and had returned to his village around two months before the incident.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1530860', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Man arrested for allegedly raping minor girl in Muzaffarabad', 'description': 'The suspect is a student at a seminary in Karachi and had returned to his village around two months before the incident.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/01/5e2f2b332a8e2.jpg?r=1278650507'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1530860', 'title': 'Man arrested for allegedly raping minor girl in Muzaffarabad', 'description': 'The suspect is a student at a seminary in Karachi and had returned to his village around two months before the incident.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/01/5e2f2b332a8e2.jpg?r=1278650507'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-01-27 23:26:58', 'modified_time': '2020-01-27 23:34:16', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/934/tariq-naqash'}, 'author': 'Tariq Naqash'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/846465/zardari-signs-bill-harassment-of-women-is-now-a-crime,3/10/10 0:00,Zardari signs bill: Harassment of women is now a crime,"ISLAMABAD, March 9 President Asif Ali Zardari signed on Tuesday the Protection Against Harassment of Women at Workplace Bill, 2010, aimed at providing a safe working environment.

The president signed the bill at a ceremony attended by some 100 women activists, parliamentarians and members of civil society organisations in the presidency.

He reiterated the government's commitment to ensuring equal rights for men and women in accordance with the Constitution.

“We have to create a Pakistan where the coming generations, my daughters, can be proud of the fact that they live as equals. We will make sure that those who wish to harm the ideology of the Quaid-i-Azam, which was for equality for men and women, shall not succeed,” he said.

The president, invoking the name of Benazir Bhutto, said “We shall do our utmost by the end of this tenure. All the rights that we enjoy as men shall be enjoyed by women as well.”He recalled the commitment made by Ms Bhutto at the Beijing Conference and in the CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, adopted in 1979 by the UN General Assembly) document, and urged the government to seek guidance from her vision to achieve gender equality.Mr Zardari recalled the struggle and sacrifices of Benazir Bhutto and said she was a symbol of strength, bravery and courage. “My wife was much stronger than me. She left a legacy for us to follow even she is guiding us from her grave.”

He said she coined the slogan “democracy is the best revenge” and said the whole philosophy of the Pakistan People's Party revolved around that phrase - that not revenge, but freedom is the revenge.

He mentioned how Ms Bhutto would have felt when she walked into Sukkur jail at the age of 21 as she tried to fight for her imprisoned father.

“Fighting like no other person I have ever seen. And throughout her life she made sure that the legacy which her father gave life for stayed alive.”

He said history might remember him as a person who was “living a woman's dream”. It was her dream that a woman in power would bring in the soft touch that the world needed amidst too much horror and said “what we need to emulate is gentleness, perseverance and the quality to bear pain”.

The president said both his sisters were members of parliament, while her two daughters would be back after completing their studies to serve the nation, along with their brother.

He paid rich tribute to the women who over the generations had strived for their rights since long and described them as “really a tribute to God's divine creation.”

He also lauded the role of women which they played in history and said all religions accord them due regard, dignity and honour.

“Let us mobilise the collective power of women to help make our country, the region and the world more tolerant and secure for all,” he said.

The bill aimed at creating a working environment for women free from harassment, abuse and intimidation, he added.

He thanked all those who supported the bill in both houses.

Mr Zardari said the struggle for the rights of women in Pakistan had been long and difficult.

“We believe in equal rights and equal opportunities for men and women,” he added.

“On this occasion I urge all ministries to get going and adopt the code of conduct within a month, as laid down in this act,” the president directed.

“I also urge the private sector to cooperate in the implementation of this act, in letter and spirit,” he said.

The bill was unanimously passed by the National Assembly on Jan 21 and by the Senate on Feb 26.

Shahnaz Wazir Ali, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Social Welfare, recalled the process of drafting the legislation.

The Alliance Against Sexual Harassment (Aasha), a civil society organisation, which has been working on the issue, has described the signing of the bill a milestone for women.

Aqsa Khan of Aasha said “This is a true partnership of citizens and the government. We want the government to ensure its implementation.”

She said “Pakistan now stands as a leading country in South Asia for having a specific legislation against sexual harassment at workplace.”

Dr Fouzia Saeed, a woman activist who remained engaged with the process for two years, said “The government has honoured its commitment for a progressive social legislation. This is a breakthrough and we expect continued support to other such laws to make society more civilised and accountable.”

She said in a statement that women activists were thankful to Shahnaz Wazir Ali, Sherry Rehman, Raza Rabbani, Senate Chairman Farooq H. Naek and senior leadership of the PPP. She said they were also very proud of members of the Awami National Party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement and many progressive parliamentarians of the Pakistan Muslim League-Q and the PML-N.

Overcoming years of conservative opposition, the National Assembly passed the bill to punish harassment of women at workplaces, though last-minute amendments extended the protection to men as an apparent compromise.

Punishment for the guilty, or violators of a code of conduct, will range from a censure to dismissal to an unspecified fine under the law.

The law defines harassment as “any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favours or other verbal and written communication or physical conduct of a sexual nature or sexually demeaning attitudes, causing interference with the work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, or the attempt to punish the complainant for refusal to comply to such a request or is made condition for employment.”

All organisations, including federal and provincial government ministries, departments, corporations, educational institutions, private commercial organisations and registered civil society associations, will be required to constitute inquiry committees of at least three members each - one of them a woman - to probe complaints and give their findings within 30 days to the competent authority concerned that will award recommended penalties.

Minor penalties will be censure, withholding for specified periods of promotion or increment and stoppage at an efficiency bar in the time-scale, other than fitness to cross such bar, and recovery of compensation payable to a complainant from pay or any other source of the accused.

Major penalties are demotion to a lower post or time-scale or to a lower stage in a time-scale, compulsory retirement, removal from service, dismissal from service, and fine, a part of which can be used as compensation for the complainant. “In case of owner (found guilty), the fine shall be payable to the complainant.”

An inquiry committee may recommend to an ombudsperson for appropriate action against a complainant whose allegations are found to be false and made with mala fide intentions while a party aggrieved by the decision of the competent authority may prefer appeal to the ombudsperson to be appointed by the federal or a provincial government.

Appeals against the decisions of an ombudsperson at the federal level can be made to the president and at provincial level to the governor concerned.

The statement of objects and reasons, accompanying the law, “is to create a safe working environment for workers which is free of sexual harassment, abuse and intimidation” with a view to enabling higher productivity and better quality of life at work.

“Sexual harassment is one of the biggest hurdles faced by working men and women, preventing many from working to get themselves and their families out of poverty,” the law says.","['Images Staff', 'Khurram Husain', 'F.S.

https://www.dawn.com/news/538239/honour-killing-and-islam,5/28/10 0:00,Honour killing and Islam,"THE feudal structure of our society follows its own barbaric rules in order to perpetrate the inhuman and unjust system for the benefit of the few at the top rung of the hierarchical ladder. No matter which name they go by, the number of atrocities committed in the name of honour run into hundreds every year.

The despicable custom has filtered down to all the social classes, urban and rural. The heinous crime is committed in the name of honour to cover up property disputes, to avenge an old and festering enmity; or, if a woman asks for divorce from an abusing husband; or, to defend a murderer who has killed a man and tries to cover it up by killing an innocent woman, accusing the victims of being karo kari, and like cases. The term implies adultery, an extra-marital affair or sex outside of marriage, or obscenity, especially in the case of minors.

A double murder is also committed if a man and a woman decide to marry of their own choice. In many cases the woman victim might be the murderer's sister, ex-wife or some other relative. Since the murderer also pretends to be the aggrieved party, he can twist the case in his own favour by pleading that his honour was soiled, and that he had no other recourse but to kill the offender! He often manages to get off with a light sentence, if any at all. Close relatives of the slain are also known to forgive the killer.

If, today, a husband finds his wife committing adultery with a man, it is considered acceptable in many Muslim countries for the husband to kill both the partners in the act, and most certainly the wife. But the Quran has a completely different story to tell. In li'an,the procedure adopted when a husband accuses his wife of adultery, but cannot produce four witnesses, he is supposed to go to the authorities and has to swear four times that what he is saying is the truth. SurahAl-Nur says “Those who accuse their wives of adultery and cannot produce four witnesses, except for themselves, they should swear an oath by God four times that they are telling the truth. And swear a fifth oath invoking the curse of God if he is telling a lie. The punishment can be removed from the wife if she swears an oath four times by God that the husband is lying. And a fifth oath that the curse of God should be upon her if he, (the husband), is telling the truth.” (24 6-9).

If she confesses or remains silent, she will be given the punishment fixed for adultery. If she chooses to swear that she is innocent, her word will be upheld against that of the husband, and they can undergo a divorce.

Based on the sayings of the Prophet (PBUH), the child born thereafter will be called the child of the mother, and will not in any way be connected with the father. If after this anyone calls the woman an adulterer, or the child an illegitimate issue, that person can be given the punishment of 80 stripes due to a slanderer, who will never be treated as a reliable witness again (see 24 4). Unless a person can produce four witnesses, he should not bring up such a charge in the first place. Traditionally, the woman killed for karo kari is not given a proper burial, nor is she buried in the community graveyard. No one is supposed to visit the grave even later. Here it would benefit us to look at a hadith of the Prophet. Once a woman confessed to having committed adultery. The Prophet sent her back four times trying to avert the punishment, but she was persistent. At last she was given the punishment. After that the Prophet asked that her funeral prayer be said and she be buried in the same manner in which any other Muslim is buried.

The problem will persist until concrete steps are taken to eliminate honour killing. It is imperative that we include, train and re-orient the police and the religious leaders such as the pesh imams and the qaris in the scheme for reform. The religious leaders must be convinced that this practice goes against the Quran and should be asked to teach people in their sermons and the children in madressahs what an unjust act and a heinous sin and crime this brutal murder is. If we start now we can hope that at least our next generation will become more humane in the matter.","['Nilofar Ahmed', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

Speaking to media personnel relatives blamed the PCB for the young sportswoman's death and added that the dismissal of harassment charges against Maulvi Sultan Alam and his subsequent damages claim worth 20 million rupees had disheartened Halima Rafique and driven her to commit suicide.

The relatives added that the 17-year-old drank acid during her fast which led to her death.

In June 2013, Rafique and four other girls had accused the management of the Multan Cricket Club (MCC) of sexual harassment.

At the time, a two-member committee investigated the allegations and recorded statements.

Three of the accusing cricketers had appeared before the committee and denied charges of sexual assault.

However, Rafique and another female cricketer who had made the accusations had not appeared before the committee.

The inquiry committee had recommended that all five cricketers should be banned from playing all forms of cricket for six months with effect from Oct 23, 2013.","['Event Horizon', 'Faisal Taquie', 'Noor Memon', 'Saad Zafar', 'Fida Sayani', 'Ali Hemani', 'Sunny Boye', 'Shafiq Khan', 'Ali Hassan', 'Shafiq Khan.']","LAHORE: Relatives of the seventeen-year-old female cricketer, Halima Rafique, who was found dead and later buried in her hometown of Multan, held Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) responsible for her death, DawnNews reported on Tuesday.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1578016,9/5/20 7:05,Supreme Court sees no honour in honour killings,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Friday observed that the killing of women in the name of honour had never been an honourable practice, saying such murders should not be categorised as honour killings.

“It will help deter such killings if the term ‘Ghairat’ is not used to describe them,” observed Justice Qazi Faez Isa in a judgement he authored while hearing a jail petition.

A two-judge bench headed by Justice Isa had taken up the jail appeal of Mohammad Abbas against the Sept 8, 2015 verdict of the Lahore High Court in the murder case of his wife, Saima Bibi.

Justice Isa regretted that not enough was being done to discourage crimes against women as extremism and violence have permeated through Pakistani society and it has been brutalised.

Justice Isa says not enough is being done to discourage crime against women

Mohammad Abbas was facing the allegation of killing his wife over suspected infidelity. Saima Bibi was the sister of Mohammad Asghar, the complainant who reported to police that his sister was killed by her husband. The crime was stated to have been committed at 1am on May 17, 2009 and an FIR was registered at the Baraghar police station, Nankana Sahib district.

Mohammad Abbas was tried by the sessions judge of Nankana Sahib who convicted and awarded death sentence to the accused for qatl-i-amd (murder) of his wife. He was also directed to pay compensation of Rs50,000 to the legal heirs of the deceased and in default of the payment he would face six-month simple imprisonment.

The high court, however, reduced the sentence of death to imprisonment for life because the accused had fired only once at the deceased.

The Supreme Court, however, dismissed the jail appeal on the grounds that there was no reason justifying the grant of leave as the trial court determined that the petitioner killed his wife while the high court upheld the conviction though reduced the sentence to life imprisonment.

Referring to honour killing, Justice Isa explained that it was inaccurate to translate Urdu word ‘Ghairat’ into English as ‘honour’, adding that the Urdu word did not have an exact English equivalent.

A more accurate translation of the trait of ‘Ghairat’ would be ‘arrogance’ and the one with such a trait is an ‘arrogant’ person.

Pakistan has one of the highest, if not the highest per capita honour killings in the world and predominantly the victims are women, Justice Isa regretted, adding that by stating that murder was committed on the pretext of ghairat (honour) the murderer hopes to provide some justification for the crime.

It may also elevate the murderer’s social status with those not familiar with what Almighty Allah commands in the Holy Quran, Justice Isa observed.

This is unfortunate, more so because there is no honour in such killings, Justice Isa observed, adding that the parliament was rightly concerned with the prevalence of such killings and enacted legislation to dissuade, if not stop, such crimes.

It did so by ensuring that offenders do not avail of the benefit of section 302(c) PPC, for which the maximum punishment is twenty-five years imprisonment but which does not prescribe a minimum punishment, Justice Isa recalled.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1580178,9/17/20 19:51,"WDD Punjab, UN Women launch implementation framework to support gender mainstreaming in govt departments","The Women Development Department (WDD) Punjab and UN Women Pakistan launched Punjab Women Development Policy (PWDP) 2018 Implementation Framework on Thursday with an objective to integrate gender focused activities in the workplans of all government departments and institutions to ensure gender mainstreaming in provincial planning.

The provincial government developed the PWDP 2018 to systematically eradicate all manifestations of explicit and implicit gender discrimination across all spheres of society and address the whole range of women development concerns and challenges in line with the spirit of the Constitution, Pakistan’s international commitments and priorities of the provincial government to pursue the goal of gender mainstreaming and women empowerment in Punjab.

The policy has seven key sectoral strategies, namely Women Political Empowerment and Rights Based Governance; Women and Education/Skills Development, Women and Health; Women Poverty Reduction and Economic Empowerment; Gender Based Violence; Women and Climate Change and last but not the least Women and ICT.

The implementation framework provides a set of activities, their monitoring and evaluation plan keeping within these strategic areas. The framework was finalised after a long process of individual and group consultations and validation workshops, repeatedly engaging with all 36 departments.

Minister Women Development Ashifa Riaz Fatyana, in her keynote address expressed her optimism that the framework will play a key role in changing realities in women’s favour in the province. She added that poor implementation is often the cause for lack of success of any policy. This document spells out roles and responsibilities and provides one platform to all departments in Punjab for measuring success and chalking a way forward.

Ambreen Raza, Secretary WDD, said, “This framework will bring us closer to our vision of a gender-sensitive Punjab, where women and men enjoy equity and equality in all walks of life; women and girls are able to fulfill their roles towards achieving and enjoying individual and collective well-being, development and prosperity without any explicit or implicit discrimination.”

Sidra Minhas, Consultant UN Women, presented highlights of the framework identifying gender disaggregated data collection, capacity building and awareness as key activities for all relevant departments.

Jacqui Ketunuti, Deputy Country Representative UN Women Pakistan, in her opening remarks, said, “It is a matter of great pride for us that, with the strong and capable leadership of the WDD, 36 provincial departments came together and endorsed the integration of activities in their workplans to ensure that Punjab can make progress on gender equality in the thematic areas of political empowerment, education, health, economic empowerment, gender-based violence, climate change and ICT. This is the first and largest such initiative for gender mainstreaming in the province.”

Saman Ahsan, Portfolio Manager EVAW, Governance & Human Rights UN Women Pakistan, said, “UN Women and Women Development Department form a natural alliance as we both work on same agenda of women empowerment and gender equality. The framework is one commendable result that came out of this collaboration.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1552827,4/28/20 5:16,Policing Covid-19,"THE coronavirus pandemic has assigned more responsibilities and roles to police. Globally, the police are making changes in operational strategies and reallocating whatever human and financial resources they have at their disposal. However, an effective response requires far more, including: additional funds, enlistment of volunteers, active communication strategies, optimum use of technology, drafting of SOPs, improved institutional coordination, and strengthening of community networks.

The enormity of the crisis has convinced governments to introduce stricter laws and regulations. To enforce lockdown, for instance, France planned deployment of 100,000 policemen and establishment of fixed checkpoints. In Italy, violators of the curfew face a three-month imprisonment or a fine of 206 euros. To monitor social distancing, Italy also approved the use of drones by police.

In Norway, a 20,000 kroner fine or 15-day imprisonment was announced for those breaking self-quarantine rules. Though Pakistan also introduced self-quarantine and isolation measures, Norway adopted all these with legal and administrative backup. Any Norwegian who travelled abroad in recent weeks has to self-isolate for 14 days, and anyone who has been in close contact with a confirmed Covid-19 patient must undergo self-isolation for two weeks. In Denmark, police send text messages to mobile subscribers as a reminder to abide by the instructions.

In the UK, police will be authorised to use force to send people back home to self-isolate during lockdown. The London Metropolitan Police requested officers who retired within the last five years to rejoin the force, either on a voluntary or paid basis. Those close to retirement have been instructed to delay their departure. In Pakistan, however, the majority of those who retire at the age of 60 face health complications, so it is difficult to replicate such initiatives here.

The police are in a better position to act as first responders.

Another concern is how to police the cyberspace. Malaysia and Singapore have clamped down on online misinformation about the coronavirus, and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commis­sion arrested some suspects for spreading misinformation about the outbreak.

The gravity of the situation in Pakistan suggests that, through criminal justice measures, self-isolation instructions need to be clearly specified. Without incorporating crisis management functions into the law, along with updated training modules and exclusive allocation, the police will be reduced to the status of a spectator or reporting agency.

Initially, the health crisis resulted in fewer crimes. However, in parts of Italy, the police warned the public to watch out for impostors knocking on doors and claiming to be Red Cross volunteers. In densely populated countries like India and Pakistan, if the coronavirus spell drags out, it may bring a surge in crimes.

Because the police has a presence in all areas, it is in a better position to immediately act as first responders. And since police stations are the basic functional apparatus of the state, citizens expect a lot more from them. The rural police stations may also be of great help in these times, but greater coordination between the health department and the police needs to be institutionalised.

Websites, email, helplines and SMS are effective tools to reach the public. All provincial police departments maintain websites, but like the centralised policing model, our websites are also over-centralised. Though a handful of police departments are running pages on social media, effective linkage requires interactive public-friendly police websites. During the ongoing crisis, for the first time, the Punjab Police started optimum use of its official website that will simultaneously improve public and media relations.

While law enforcement and public health is an emerging field, in developing countries, public health and policing are averse to collaboration. Participation of the police in such crisis could improve their image and highlight their humane face.

In Pakistan, there is hardly any effort by police organisations to document relief operations and review flaws in their working. During times of crisis, the police performs multiple functions, like rescue operations, protection of life and property, crowd management, security during relief distribution, security of rescue camps, managing traffic, and coordinating with other agencies. Since the police have regular interaction with the public, they are in the best position to infuse volunteerism among residents.

Numerical strength alone cannot yield dividends. There is a need for more comprehensive legislation, capacity building, training and equipment. The police must be financed and empowered in a manner that, before seeking help of civil armed forces, they should have the capacity to sustain the burden during the initial phase of a major crisis.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1288539/polish-lawmakers-overwhelmingly-reject-total-ban-on-abortion,10/7/16 6:36,Polish lawmakers overwhelmingly reject total ban on abortion,"WARSAW: Women take part in a nationwide demonstration on Monday to protest against a legislative proposal for a total ban of abortion.—AFP

WARSAW: Polish lawmakers voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to reject a proposal by an anti-abortion group that would have imposed a total ban on abortion, caving in to massive outrage by women who have been dressing in black and waging street protests across the country.

The mostly Catholic nation already has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, with abortion only allowed in rare cases — rape or incest, when the mother’s life is in danger or the foetus is badly damaged.

The proposal for further tightening the law came from a citizens’ initiative that gathered some 450,000 signatures in this nation of 38 million. It was supported by the Roman Catholic church.

But it was highly unpopular with most Poles, with people baulking at the idea that a teenage rape victim should be forced to have her baby, or that a woman whose health was badly compromised would be forced to carry to term. The proposal had also called for prison terms of up to five years for women who sought abortions.

With abortion already illegal in most cases, many women said what frightened them the most in the proposal was that it could have led doctors to be afraid to perform prenatal tests or that women who suffered miscarriages could start to fall under criminal suspicion.

Initially many members of the conservative ruling party, Law and Justice, supported the proposal. Two weeks ago a majority of lawmakers voted to consider it, sending it to a commission for further study. But the party backed away from it under massive social pressure, and lawmakers voted against it 352-58.

The outcome of the vote is a blow to the ruling party, which has a core of ultra-conservative Catholic voters that wanted to see further restrictions to the abortion law. But the party also came to power thanks to centrist voters and young people who were attracted by the party’s welfare programme, with its promises to help the poor and even out the vast economic differences of the post-communist era.

Many in that latter group have been taking to the streets in recent days, and opinion polls show that the party’s support has now fallen to its lowest point since it won elections a year ago. Now the party finds itself on the defensive after angering groups on all sides — women, its traditional opposition, moderates among its own electorate and religious conservatives.

Mariusz Dzierzawski, from the Stop Abortion committee, accused the ruling party leadership of “hypocrisy” for turning its back on his group’s proposal. Prime Minister Beata Szydlo vowed that her government will now take other steps to protect human life. She announced a new plan to earmark more money from the budget for families with disabled children and said it would begin an information campaign that would “promote the protection of life”.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1486846,6/8/19 7:17,Sexual harassment,"SEXUAL harassment encompasses many behaviours — assault and battery, stalking, unwanted physical contact or attention, undesired comments on a person’s dress or body, jokes and innuendoes about women or gender nonconforming persons, exposing and sharing sexual material, or using blackmail, threats, or offering benefits in exchange for sexual favours. Much of this array of offending behaviour is penalised by criminal, civil rights and tort law. But it was the #MeToo movement across the globe and in Pakistan that exposed the magnitude and ubiquitous nature of the problem. It was cathartic for some survivors, who felt silenced or let down by the justice system, to share their stories.

In Pakistan, the National Commission on the Status of Women found that 50 per cent of women they interviewed from the public sector had faced sexual harassment. To protect women in the workplace against this harm, and to enhance their safe participation in the workforce, parliament enacted the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act in 2010, which made it mandatory for all employers to form inquiry committees to investigate claims of sexual harassment.

In order to constitute sexual harassment under the act, the conduct must meet a two-pronged test. It must be unwelcome behaviour of one or more of the following kinds: sexual advances, requests for sexual favours, oral or written sexual communication, sexual contact or touching, and sexually demeaning attitudes; second, this behaviour must interfere with the employee’s work, or create an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, or be made a condition for employment.

A recent LHC decision interprets the law to cover all kinds of workplaces and work arrangements.

The definition of sexual harassment in Pakistani law almost mirrors the legal standard prescribed for the same by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In the 1970s and 1980s, American courts interpreted the law on sexual harassment, and framed it as a form of discrimination on the basis of sex and a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 1964 — an anti-discrimination employment statute.

A study that analysed 650 cases in US federal courts found judges adjudicated favourably in cases where the offending behaviour was against one person rather than women, involved physical contact, or where the communication was overtly sexual as opposed to non-sexual but sexist, demeaning or discriminatory. Two typical forms of sexual harassment accepted in American courts include quid pro quo harassment where an explicit request for sexual favours is made in return for economic or job-related benefits, and a pervasively hostile work environment claim where an employee must endure verbal or physical abuse as part of their employment.

The Pakistani statute defines sexual harassment to include both quid pro quo and hostile work claims. A recent Lahore High Court decision (Asif Saleem, 2019) outlines sexual harassment law in a few countries and interprets the act to cover all kinds of workplaces and work arrangements. This is positive and shows that our courts, emboldened by media coverage and advocacy, are willing to direct the evolution of this law in our own context.

The court discusses how the 2010 law is a manifestation of constitutional guarantees to women — equality (Article 25), full participation in national life (Article 34) and dignity (Article 14). It deliberates on how sexual harassment discourages women from employment and hinders their contribution. It dismisses the claim that women file such claims to ‘trap’ men.

To assess whether harassing behaviour constitutes an abusive or hostile work environment, the court cites the practice in some American courts that opt for a ‘reasonable woman’ benchmark. Women’s sensibilities about what constitutes a corrosive work environment may differ from men. It’s a fairer indicator and should be applied in Pakistan. In interpreting harassment as discrimination, courts could find that “sexually demeaning attitude” includes sexist comments, efforts to undermine women’s role in the workplace, belittle their work, or prevent their advancement and leadership.

Since sexual harassment is a form of discrimination against women, Pakistani institutions must eventually address the informal sector. The act was conceived for formal workplaces with standard employer-employee relationships. But most women in Pakistan work in non-traditional work settings such as agricultural, domestic and home-based work. They may approach the ombudsperson directly or file a criminal case. But both are impractical remedies due to socioeconomic constraints. Hence, the harm they suffer is double — traditionally, they’ve had no protection from labour laws, and sexual harassment laws provide only a tenuous coverage.

Feminist theorists have played a critical role in developing the concept of workplace sexual harassment. Catherine MacKinnon authored the groundbreaking Sexual Harassment of Working Women in 1979, recounting stories of sexually charged behaviour women had to put up with at work for decades. In the gendered workplace, it works as a tool to maintain female subordination and their status as outsiders, and to enforce masculine norms. Studies show even women in supervisory positions face sexual harassment, sometimes from those inferior or equal to them. The abuser weaponises harassment to ‘level’ the playing field. Gender nonconforming persons are also targeted, and sexual harassment becomes a way of policing gender.

Some feminists alert us to the moral symbolism in the requirement that the sexual words or acts be ‘unwelcome’. This connotes that some sexual behaviour at the workplace is not ‘unwelcome’, thereby allowing courts to scrutinise a victim’s character, past or otherwise, and shift blame away from the harasser. The requirement that the sexual conduct be ‘unwelcome’ is unfortunately part of the Pakistani statute as well.

In Pakistan, conversations around #MeToo have encouraged many to come forward with their stories. Women’s rights activists have to constantly recalibrate the debate — that harassment is not a rite of passage one must patiently tolerate in order to progress in one’s career; that the focus should be on the overwhelming harassment working women face, and not the few cases that may be frivolous; that sexual jokes and comments are not ‘men being men’ (tharak as normal) but indeed harmful and vindictive male gossip.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1490687,6/27/19 7:09,Dealing with child abuse,"THE abduction, rape and murder of eight-year-old Zainab in Kasur in January 2018 shook the entire nation out of its complacency in such cases. But hopes of a decline in child abuse, even after the hanging of the culprit seven months later, have not been realised.

The figure of 3,445 children who were sexually abused in 2017 has often been mentioned as an annual estimate. A chilling case recently reported involved 10-year-old Farishta. It exposed, in addition to a sex fiend’s brutality, the customary cupidity of the police. This only means that protection of children against sexual abuse, even if they are not killed, must remain high on the national agenda.

The federal government responded with a bill in the National Assembly, The Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Bill, to create an agency to deal with cases of missing children. The Assembly returned the bill to the mover on grounds of its vagueness. There is now a revised version. Vagueness apart, this bill was an extremely shoddy draft. The authors had taken incredible liberties with the English language and preferred verbosity to brevity.

Take the sentence “It is essential to legislate for an institutional response at the level of such areas in the federation as are not included in any province”. It could have been replaced with ‘It is necessary to provide for an institutional response in the federal territory’.

The seriousness of the matter demands that the government take whatever help it can from CSOs.

Besides, the bill is a hodgepodge of provisions only some of which could be part of the law, while many others should be in the rules. The penalty under sections 361-A and 369 of the Penal Code has been increased with the addition of hefty amounts in fine. An annexure lists 49 bits of information about the missing child to be gathered by the organisation. The table would have a better place in the rules because placing it within the law precludes the collection of information not included in it. It should have been put in the rules with the addition of a line ‘And any other information that may be considered necessary’.

Besides, opinion is divided on whether the bill and the agency to be created under it should be named after a victim, because it involves perpetuating the memory of one among the many equally wronged children.

The proposed law and the agency created under it are to be administered by the ‘National Commission on the Rights of the Child’. Where is this commission? If the reference is to the cell in the secretariat of the Wafaqi Mohtasib, that cell, despite the presence of a few dedicated persons, does not have the human and financial resources the task requires.

The seriousness of the matter demands that the government take whatever help it can from civil society organisations. While some of them are monitoring incidents of children’s abduction, rape and murder, we need more investigative studies such as Accountability for Rape: A Case Study of Lodhran, carried out by the University College, Lahore.

Statistics attached to the study show that the police submitted reports on 7,120 rape cases under Section 376 of the Penal Code in Punjab during 2016 and 2017. The number of cases decided was 5,814 and the number of convictions a mere 216 (3.7 per cent only). The districts that reported the highest number of rape incidents (and a poor conviction rate) are: Lahore, where 191 cases out of 418 were decided with three convictions; Rahim Yar Khan, 393 cases, with 370 decided and eight convictions; Bahawalpur, 355 cases with 286 decided and eight convictions; Khanewal, 355 cases, with 243 decided and nine convictions; Lodhran, 310 cases, with 252 decided and 16 convictions; and Faisalabad, 305 cases, with 330* decided and 14 convictions.

The districts reporting the lowest incidence are: Jhelum, 19 cases, with 32* decided and one conviction; Mianwali, 23 cases, with 27* decided and two convictions; Attock, 23 cases, with 36* decided and three convictions; Chakwal, 36 cases, with 34 decided and two convictions; Khushab, 39 cases, with 45* decided and one conviction; and Narowal, 44 cases with 46* decided and six convictions.

[ * The cases decided included some filed earlier than 2016. The total number decided over the two years was 9,154, while there were 7,120 new cases. The victims include small girls and older women, but that doesn’t matter while determining the course of the law.]

Let the experts determine the causes of variation in cases of rape in the Punjab districts. What can be noted at first sight is that the incidence of rape cases could be proportional to the degree of development in a district.

The study offers plenty of food for thought to lawmakers, police and prosecutors regarding the failure to punish rapists. It finds that in 85pc of acquittals the reason was the resiling of witnesses. After a brief review of laws applicable to rape cases, the study points out the causes of the poor conviction rate: a rape case takes on average 560 days to decide as against the stipulated period of 90 days; delayed filing of FIRs; delays in medical examination; inconsistencies in the victim’s statements; conduct of witnesses (relatives and strangers); questionable methods of medical tests; violence; cases of married women; and variations in the age of a minor. Many recommendations have been made and merit serious consideration.

New research should also cover the social factors that contribute to abduction and rape. For instance, what can be done to reduce the population of street children? Will compulsory schooling help? Can improved housing for the poor prevent them from telling their little ones to spend the day in the streets?

A key finding in most rape studies is that children are unusually vulnerable at schools and madressahs and many of the culprits are members of victims’ families or known to them. Stricter control of educational centres and essential sex education for children and their mothers are fundamental to strategies to protect the nation’s precious children from the most horrible cycle of abduction, rape and murder.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1494208,7/15/19 12:55,Pakistan's silent suicide problem,"Families cover up what happened to their loved one. And taboo prevents all discussion.

Updated 28 Apr 2020

Between 15 to 35 people end their lives in Pakistan every day.

That's as high as one person every hour.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that in 2012, the rate of suicide in Pakistan was 7.5 per 100,000 people. In other words, around 13,000 people killed themselves that year.

In 2016, the estimate was 2.9 per 100,000 i.e. over 5,500 ended their lives. Experts say the number of people dying is likely somewhere between the two figures, but the truth remains hidden.

This project hopes to end the silence by giving those who have suffered space to share their stories; by providing expert commentary and by providing access to a few resources the country has to offer those seeking help.

Trigger warning: The content that follows contains stories of suicide and suicide attempts, which may trigger some readers. Please proceed with caution and contact your mental health advisor in case of a crisis.

Suicide survey

To better understand the trends and context surrounding suicide in Pakistan, Dawn.com published an online survey in December 2018, asking respondents to anonymously share their views and stories about suicide. The non-scientific survey was published on the website and shared on social media, reflecting views of a segment of Dawn.com's readership, as captured in the respondent demographics outlined below.

The responses — 5,157 in total — provide a unique starting point to exploring the issue.

A few findings include:

38% of respondents said they personally know someone who has taken their own life.

43% said they personally know someone who has attempted suicide.

45% said they have thought about suicide but never acted on it.

9% said they have tried to end their lives.





1. Respondent demographics

A majority of those who took the survey are between 18-40 years old, male (72%), and from the three major cities.

3. Do you know someone who has attempted suicide and survived?

Over 40% said they knew someone who had survived a suicide attempt.





4. Have you ever tried to end your life or thought about ending your life?

Respondents were evenly divided between those who have tried or thought of suicide, and those who have not. An additional 9% said they have tried to take their life.





5. Has someone ever spoken to you about having suicidal thoughts?

45% said they have had someone speak to them about feeling suicidal.





6. To what degree might the below causes lead someone to commit suicide?

Over half of respondents considered mental illness and financial troubles as 'high likelihood' reasons for suicide. Divorce was seen as having the lowest likelihood of resulting in suicide.





7. Which of the below describe your opinion of suicide? Select all that apply.

A low 8% of respondents considered suicide an immoral act. However, almost a quarter considered it a sign of weakness. The most common opinion was that suicide is, 'A way to escape pain'.





8. What barriers prevent a suicidal person from seeking help? Check all that apply.

The two barriers to seeking help that ranked highest are, 'Feeling like nothing will help' and, 'Lack of social support', followed closely by, 'Embarrassment or social stigma'.





9. Please select all that apply: Seeing a mental health professional is...

The most common opinion from the statements is that seeking professional help is, 'Not accessible for most people'.

Losing our son

By Atiya Naqvi

Our son Emad died of a suicide on May 18, 2018 in Boston. He was working his dream job as a soccer coach in Boston. He had two FIFA licenses in coaching and was full of dreams and plans about his future. Emad was known for his wit and quirky humour and he was the life of a party amongst his very large circle of friends.

Emad with his mother, Atiya Naqvi, on his 21st birthday.

Our trip to Boston in a few hours is a harrowing blur of a long never ending flight where at times even the simple act of breathing was difficult. I was sure that my son had been a victim of foul play and so I and my husband were just grieving the injustice of our son losing his life just when everything seemed so promising and rosy.

However, once we got to Boston we were handed the note left behind by our son. It was clearly written in Emad’s own writing stating that this was a voluntary suicide and that he had left a video for his parents and two siblings on his phone to explain his reasons for ending his life.

Emad has left an almost two hour long video where he talks about his reasons for committing suicide.

He spoke about his teenage years when he was fat, when he was an average sports man, and an average student. He said he was always an A-grader but never an A-starrer. He says he felt he never made us proud and he was always someone who scraped through life in general. He said he always covered up his inadequacies with a wiseass attitude. He cited many examples of when he felt less than the others and every time we as parents were supportive of him he felt even worse for not being better than he was.

Emad as a coach with his players.

He went on to say that he started to feel different once he started to work as a soccer coach and changed his undergraduate major to pursue a career in soccer coaching. He said that he began to like himself and that he enjoyed the life he was now building for himself.

At the same time he couldn’t believe a mediocre person like him could achieve all that he had and so there had to be something wrong, which needed to be ended.

He ended the video by saying that he didn’t believe he was good enough, and that his current life of success and achievement was an illusion. He didn’t want this illusion to end and so he wanted to end his self-described “mediocre” life.

He was calm and loving throughout the video; there was no anxiety or fear on his face or in his demeanor. It was almost like a FaceTime conversation, except our beloved Emad was on longer on the other end of the phone. He couldn’t hear us sob or see the shock and devastation on our faces, he was gone — taking all his misguided beliefs of self-condemnations with him without realizing his worth.

In the months following my son’s passing I, his mother and a clinical psychologist, am now left with questions and no concrete answers.

A part of me died with Emad that day. As any mother would tell you, surviving your child’s death is a hell with no escape.

I struggle to think what the hardest part of my life is since my son left our world. The mornings when my eyes open to realize there is another interminable day ahead, my nights with no sleep till sheer exhaustion overtakes me, my responsibility towards my other two children, fear and self-doubt about myself as a mother, psychologist…. I could go on.

There is no end to this agony; at times I don't even want it to end as this is all I am left with.

In those dark hours, I turned to my training and then my faith. My training as a psychologist reconnected me back to my faith. After about three months of feeling utterly adrift in a dark space I returned to restructure my life. I read all I could about afterlife and grief, from a religious, psychological and spiritual perspective. I tried to accept my new reality without a fight, and replaced my WHY with a WHAT.

The new reality had no sleep, so I filled my nights with reading, praying and meditating. I worked on my own mental and physical health as best as I knew how. My friends and family were loving and supportive beyond imagination.

Emad at home with his family.

My life became about spending time with my husband and children. We valiantly tried to focus on Emad’s life and the person he was, instead of merely focusing on his last unfortunate choice. Each one of us tried to honour Emad’s life by devoting a part of our lives to carry his legacy.

My husband started Coach Emad Football Academy for underprivileged, but extremely talented children of Lyari. My daughter who is studying literature in Italy opted to write her thesis about death as she had experienced it. My youngest son joined his dad in organizing football matches at school levels to raise funds for the academy.

And I am raising awareness about suicide and depression by speaking openly about it in an environment where suicide is still a taboo topic. I am also in the process of starting support groups for grieving mothers so that broken and lost women like me can find ways to reconstruct our lives.

I have reflected long and hard on What happened to Emad and what might have been missed by me.

Where did we as parents go wrong? What are the causes of youth around the world caving into depression and suicide?

Emad never gave any signs of depression or even mood swings. He was always upbeat, helpful, and generally a very “good boy”. Yet all he believed was that he was just “not good enough”, he didn’t want to live the rest of his life as a mediocre person.

I feel it is very important for us as parents to start talking about OUR inadequacies. Let us do away with the dogma of perfectionism, competitiveness and overachievements and have an honest conversation about what roles and expectations we are creating.

We as parents have a language of validating achievements of our children and not the children themselves. The bars of achievements are getting higher and higher every day. The school systems are result-oriented and the average students slip through cracks unseen and unheard. These are the legacies that our youth are dumped with for the rest of their lives to carry. It is a heavy burden.

It is time to change the mindsets and language of us parents and our school systems. We have to look around our immediate environment of family, friends and colleagues and ask what kind of interaction did I have today? What did I see, hear and feel in each interaction? We simply cannot afford to know anything without experiencing it.

Each one of us will have to take responsibility for our interactions and communications in all our relationships that we care for. Let us take responsibility for our intrapersonal, interpersonal, professional and social interactions.

As a starter, if every parent, teacher, a friend is paying close, interested attention with empathy and compassion to those around us perhaps it might be easier for someone like Emad to open up and say he feels less than the others. Perhaps if the environment around our young people is less expectant, less judgmental they might not feel as if no matter what they do they haven’t made their parents proud.

The world is now a global village; there are unlimited opportunities of happy, healthy options of life. These options can seem out of their reach because our children are raised and educated mostly by adults of limiting beliefs.

Our next generation will benefit from growing in loving, acceptable environments in their homes, schools, workplaces and society in general so that they can make informed choices about their lives. They must have the space to make mistakes so they can learn; and our role can be to encourage, guide and support them to make newer and better choices.

Let us open a dialogue about uncomfortable aspects of ourselves without shame. Let us be brave and begin by holding genuine, trusting communications within our environment. It is time to stop pretending or wanting to be perfect. Let us work with Love and acceptance with the imperfect as our creator does with us.

Underlying many stories is a deep sense of isolation and shame, of suffering in silence, of fear of seeking help.

Dr's note

Murad Moosa Khan, Professor of Psychiatry at Aga Khan University

When Atika first contacted me for this project and explained she wanted me to review and comment on the testimonials in the section below, I didn't think it would be too much of an effort for me. After all, I have been practising psychiatry in Pakistan for more than a quarter of a century and had seen every type of mental disorder, of both genders, of all ages, from all sorts of backgrounds and from all parts of the country. And as suicide is my area of interest, one that I had been studying and researching for over 20 years, it would be interesting as well.

Little did I know what I was about to tread upon would be a window to the internal emotional struggles that so many Pakistanis are going through, without recourse to help. There were many who had no access to mental healthcare, others hesitated to seek help for fear of stigma, yet for others it was unaffordable.

The stories in the posts are extremely powerful and tell us what people in the highly complex and convoluted society of Pakistan are going through.

The testimonials are likely from the relatively well educated, English speaking, middle to upper-middle-class sections of the society. But reading about their struggles also gives us a clue what the not so well off in our society must be going through, with poverty, illiteracy, large family size, lack of space, drug use, unemployment and domestic violence all impacting their emotional health in ways one cannot even comprehend.

There are stories of bullying, of physical and sexual abuse, of rape, of domestic violence, of a toxic family atmosphere, of mental distress and of course, of self-harm and suicide. It is surprising how many of the more than 3,000 responses that were received, had either thoughts of suicide, had carried out self-harm acts themselves or knew of someone in their family or circle of friends, who had died by suicide.

Underlying many of these stories was a deep sense of isolation and shame, of suffering in silence, of fear of seeking help due to stigma or being judged.

The stories tell us how, under the veneer of socio-cultural and religious values, all kinds of ills — from rape to betrayal to bullying and drug use — exist in an ostensibly sanitised society. They tell us how the lack of education (not only literacy), of an organised health system and of law and justice put so many young Pakistanis at risk and affecting their mental health. The stories also tell us about the lack of mental health services in the country, the poor training, and poor ethical and professional standards of many of our mental health professionals and of the shame and stigma attached to seeking help for mental health problems.

The stories also tell us about the incredible resiliency of many Pakistanis, as they fight against insurmountable odds of the society and, at times their families, to not only survive but progress in life as well.

There are many unsung heroes in this country. Some are among those who have written in.

For years, we have witnessed neglect of social development in the country; of housing and transport, of health and education, of law and order, of justice. This has resulted in a population that is highly mentally distressed, with extremely high levels of stress. Some of this stress is played out on our roads, in our homes, in extreme kinds of behaviours including suicide and terrorism.

There is an urgent need to address the many ills in this society. We need to address the upstream factors such as social factors as well as downstream factors such as more and better mental health facilities, including suicide prevention activities. This is a human rights issue.

The people of this country deserve it.

Suicide does not happen in a vacuum. There is a 'suicidal pathway' that people get on, which may start weeks or months before the event.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1525185,12/30/19 7:16,View From The Courtroom: Confidentiality about victim’s identity in child abuse cases essential,"The sexual assault on a minor boy of 10 allegedly by a seminary teacher in Mansehra district has resulted into a public outcry on social media with people demanding exemplary punishment to the perpetrator.

The local police have so far arrested four persons, while the prime suspect named Shamsuddin is still at large. The victim, who received critical injuries because of multiple assaults, has presently been under treatment at the Ayub Medical Complex, Abbottabad.

The local police in Mansehra have also sealed the said seminary where around 120 students were admitted.

Apart from social media, the print and electronic media have also been covering this incident. However, in certain cases the media organisations have been violating confidentiality regarding the identity of the victim and had not only mentioned his name and addresses, but also aired the footages showing him hospitalised in bad shape.

Presently, there are several laws and ethical codes which prohibit disclosure of identity of a rape victim, including children.

Certain amendments were made in Pakistan Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure through the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Offences Relating to Rape) Act, 2016. Through the said Act section 376-A was inserted in PPC prohibiting disclosure of identity of victim of rape.

Under this provision, whoever prints or publishes name or any matter which may make known identity of victims against whom an offence of rape is alleged or found to have been committed shall be punished up to three years imprisonment and shall also be liable to fine.

The said provision provides certain exceptions in parenting and publication, including: by or under order in writing of officer-in-charge of the police station or police officer making investigation into such offences acting in good faith for the purpose of such investigation; or, by or under order of court; or, by or with authorisation in writing of the victim: or, by or with the authorisation in writing of natural and legal guardian of the victim where the victim is dead or a minor or of unsound mind.

Another law having provision related to confidentiality of a rape victim or a child victim of sexual abuse is the Press Council of Pakistan Ordinance 2002. The said Ordinance provides an Ethical Code of Practice. Rule 14 of the Code provides: “In the case of sexual offences and heinous crime against children, juveniles and women, names and identifying photographs shall not be published.”

Under Section 15 of the ordinance, whoever publishes or circulates any matter in contravention of the Ethical Code of Practice or directions of the Commission of Inquiry or Press Council may; require him to publish an apology promptly on the page specified by the Commission or the Council, as the case may be; Issue him a warning to be carried or circulated by the newspaper or news agency concerned promptly and prominently; and ask other newspapers to publish or news agencies to circulate the decision, in case of non-compliance of the decision by concerned newspaper or news agency and recommend to the competent authority to suspend the publication for a specific period not exceeding seven issues or recommend cancellation of the declaration in the event of persistent non-compliance.

For electronic media a Code of Conduct is provided in the Pakistan Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) Ordinance.

Section 8 of the Code of Conduct relates to coverage of incidents of accidents, crimes and violence. Section 8 (5) states: “Extreme caution shall be exercised in handling themes, plots or scenes that depict sex offence and violence, including rape and other sexual assaults.

Sub-section (6) of section 8 provides: “Identity of any victim of rape, sexual abuse, terrorism or kidnapping or such victim’s family shall not be revealed without prior permission of the victim or victim’s guardian where victim is a minor.”

Furthermore, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa the KP Child Protection and Welfare Commission Act was enacted in 2010. Section 24 of that law deals with publication of name of a child involved in any proceedings.

“No report in any newspaper, magazine or news sheet of any assessment regarding a child under this Act shall disclose the name, address or school or any other particulars, which lead to the identification of the child nor shall any picture of the child be published: Provided that for reasons to be recorded in writing, the authority holding the assessment may permit such disclosure, if in its opinion such a disclosure is in the interest of the child,” sub-section (1) of section 24 states.

Sub-section 2 provides that any person contravening the provisions of sub-section (1) shall be punished with fine which may extend up to Rs10,000.

A major flaw in this provision is that it does not include electronic media and is applicable only to newspapers and magazines.

Apart from domestic legislations, there are also Guidelines of International Federation of Journalists for reporting on issues related to children.

The Guidelines state that journalists and media organisations shall strive to maintain the highest standards of ethical conduct in reporting children’s affairs and, in particular, they shall avoid programming and publication of images which intrude upon the media space of children with information which is damaging to them; consider carefully the consequences of publication of any material concerning children and shall minimise harm to children; guard against visually or otherwise identifying children unless it is demonstrably in the public interest; avoid the use of sexualised images of children; use fair, open and straightforward methods for obtaining pictures and, where possible, obtain them with the knowledge and consent of children or a responsible adult, guardian or career, etc.

A known child rights activist, Imran Takkar, said that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and other relevant authorities should take notice of these violations regarding disclosing identity of victims of sexual abuse. He said that violating the confidentiality was not only unethical rather also illegal and in violation of different laws.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1371109,11/17/17 16:03,"PTV current affairs director sacked after allegations of harassment, misuse of authority","Pakistan Television (PTV) on Friday sacked its suspended director of current affairs, Agha Masood Shorish, following allegations of sexual harassment and misuse of authority by multiple staffers at the state-run broadcaster.

A total of five inquiries had been initiated against Shorish, including three for sexual harassment. PTV's 14 producers had also filed a complaint against him in the Islamabad High Court, and the issue was also taken up in the National Assembly.

Shorish, who was suspended three months ago for negligence, had continued to receive his salary and all other benefits during his suspension period. He also officially retired around a decade ago after reaching the age of superannuation.

The executive also reportedly used PTV's legal resources to defend himself in the court even though the organisation was not a party in the case.

The Information Ministry issued a notification for his termination after participants of a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi decided to remove officers who were bringing a bad name to state-owned organisations, were posted even after retirement or had caused financial harm to them, sources said.

Tanzeela Mazhar, a former PTV employee who was among the main complainants against Shorish said in a tweet on Friday: ""Finally, [the] darkest chapter of harassment, corruption and nepotism is closed. Thank you everyone who stood by us to make this happen.""

She thanked PPP lawmakers Saeed Ghani and Shazia Marri, and multiple TV anchors for their support.

Marri had moved a calling attention notice regarding complaints by Mazhar and her fellow anchor Yashfeen Jamal earlier this year in the NA upon which the State Minister for Information Marriyum Aurangzeb had said that an unbiased committee would investigate the matter.

Mazhar had resigned from PTV later, since she said she could not keep drawing a salary without being given work by the PTV.

“I resigned because the man in question was reinstated,"" Tanzeela Mazhar had told Dawn.com earlier.

""Even though our contracts were renewed, we were not being given air time. To take a government salary but not work was unacceptable to me,” she had said.

“When I raised my voice, people responded with [degrading] comments about women, and our character and personal lives, without understanding that what we do in our private lives is a private matter,” Mazhar said while speaking of the reprisals to a social media campaign she ran against the man in question.

“I plan to raise awareness about what harassment is, as most people do not take it seriously until a person has been beaten up or raped,” Mazhar added.","['Shakeel Qarar', 'Waqas Ahmad', 'Saeed Uz Zaaman', 'Ejaz Khan', 'Siva D', 'Abdul Rahman Khan', 'Salman Syed', 'Naseer Ahmed', 'Rafia Sukhera', 'Azam A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/313916,7/29/08 0:00,Women police station exists in name only,"ISLAMABAD, July 28: Pakistan’s first women police station inaugurated by late Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in Islamabad on January 25, 1994 today exists in name only. It was destined to.

It was a good initiative but like many other social schemes, it was launched just to carry out an ""order"" - without proper ground work. Neither any legislation nor a Standard Operating System was framed regarding the jurisdiction and work of the police stations.

Nor any serious efforts were made to induct women in the police department. The first batch of female constables was recruited only in 1995.

Women police stations were supposed to provide the persecuted women in our conservative, male-dominated society a safe way to report their grievances to police.

That such stations were needed was widely agreed as woman victims feel uncomfortable discussing rape and other abuses with male police. It also opened a window for women discriminated against in education, employment and legal rights.

But the good scheme fell flat as no female police personnel were trained for the professional tasks, not even for the first women police station.

A woman sub-inspector of police had to be appointed SHO of the symbolic police station opened in Islamabad when the rules required an officer of the rank of inspector or above in the post.

Similarly only a police officer of the rank of inspector can investigate the complaints and cases filed with the police. Since no female officer of that rank existed, all the cases filed with the Islamabad women police station were investigated by male police officers, defeating the very purpose of setting up women police stations.

After carrying on the charade for 14 years, the city police hierarchy formally ordered the women police station last October to stop registering cases. When it closed its register on October 31, 2007, the station had registered 69 cases in the year.

About 140 policewomen are still on the city police rolls - 33 serving in operations department, 12 in traffic department and the remaining in the diplomatic missions' protection wing.

Their deployment at places frequented by VIPs and foreigners suggests they are there to project a ""modern"" image of Pakistan.","['Munawer Azeem', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1590201/main-suspect-in-kashmore-mother-daughter-gang-rape-killed-by-accomplice-during-encounter-police,11/13/20 22:30,"Main suspect in Kashmore mother, daughter gang-rape 'killed by accomplice during encounter': police","The main suspect in the Kashmore gang-rape incident, who was arrested a day earlier, was killed on Friday by his accomplice in an alleged 'encounter' in Kashmore district near the RD-109 area of the Sindh-Balochistan border, police officials told Dawn.com.

According to Larkana Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Nasir Aftab, the main suspect, Rafique Malik, was ""killed by the firing of co-accused Khairullah Bugti while he was taken to point out a hideout of his co-accused"" in the jurisdiction of Bakhshapur Police Station.

Bugti was later arrested along with the ""rifle after exchange of firing"", DIG Aftab told Dawn.com via text message.

A day earlier, police had arrested Malik for allegedly subjecting a woman and her minor daughter to rape for two days after duping the former with a job offer in Kashmore district.

At the time, police had said they had arrested the suspect using a trap while an accomplice was still at large.

On Friday, DIG Aftab said that during interrogation, ""the accused Rafique Malik disclosed a secret hideout of the remaining accused Khairullah Bugti at a local dargah near Bakhshapur.""

""As soon as the accused Rafique Malik along with police reached at the spot, the co-accused Khairullah started firing in which Malik died and co-accused [was] arrested with weapons,"" the DIG added.

False promise

Malik was suspected of raping a mother and her five-year-old daughter for two days after duping them into travelling to Kashmore from Karachi.

Both the victims hail from Karachi, according to Kashmore police. The woman had met Malik at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) in Karachi nearly a week ago, when he had ""promised the woman that he would get her a job at Kashmore Toll Plaza and she readily agreed”, a policeman said.

The woman arrived in Kashmore over the past weekend and met Malik. Two days later, she approached Kashmore police, alleging that he had raped her after she reached his residence, and he then handed her over to another man — Khairullah Bugti — living near the Sindh-Balochistan border. That man also allegedly raped the woman, according to a police officer.

The woman told police that the suspect held her minor daughter hostage, saying he would only let her go when she brought him another woman from Karachi. According to police, the suspect also gave her some money to cover her travelling expenses.

The trap

Kashmore police then devised a ploy to nab the suspect.

“Our ASI (assistant sub-inspector) Mohammad Bux Buriro persuaded his wife to talk to the suspect over phone which she did. Then the woman from Karachi and the ASI’s daughter waited in a park in Kashmore where the suspect was scheduled to meet them,” said Kashmore Station House Officer (SHO) Akbar Channa.

As soon as the suspect arrived there, police apprehended him, according to the SSP. He then led police to a cattle pen where he had kept the young girl. “The girl told police that he had subjected her to criminal assault,” the police officer said.

He explained that the trap was arranged and police needed a woman for this purpose so the suspect would be tricked into thinking the victim had brought another woman as he had desired. “Otherwise it would have been difficult to lay hands on him,” he said.

A case was registered against the two men on Tuesday on the complaint of Kashmore police under Sections 376 (punishment of rape), 344 (wrongful confinement for ten or more days), 420 (cheating) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code. Besides the two suspects, one unidentified person was also nominated in the case by police.

Later on Thursday, SSP Kashmore Amjad Ali Shaikh had said that Bugti had also subjected the woman to rape but spared her daughter.","['Mohammad Hussain Khan', 'Imtiaz Ali', 'M.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1371275,11/18/17 6:58,US troops told to ignore child abuse in Afghanistan,"WASHINGTON: The US Department of Defence has advised American soldiers to ignore child sex abuse in Afghanistan as a culturally acceptable phenomenon, says a Pentagon report.

The department’s “cultural-awareness training for US personnel deploying to Afghanistan … identified child sexual abuse as a culturally-accepted practice in Afghanistan,” says a report the Pentagon’s Inspector General’s office released on Thursday afternoon.

The Inspector General, however, said that his review did not lead him to a specific command or policy guideline that “expressly discouraged personnel from reporting incidents of child sexual abuse”.

But in some cases, US military personnel deployed in Afghanistan told that “nothing could be done about child sexual abuse because of Afghanistan’s status as a sovereign nation”. They were also informed that it was not a priority for the US command to discourage such practices and it was best to “ignore the situation and to let the local police handle it”.

Controversy erupted last year after a New York Times report alleged that the Pentagon had prevented US troops from reporting when Afghan police and militia officials sexually assaulted children. The report claimed that some US troops were punished when they reported the abuse.

The Pentagon rejected the report as incorrect but US lawmakers instructed the inspector general to investigate the matter and send a report to Congress.

The IG’s report noted that the US Army and Air Force training do not discuss paedophilia in Afghanistan, but Navy and Marines do. The Navy training manual “advises readers to control and overcome any frustration caused by cultural differences that they may experience during their deployments,” while the Marines were told “to be mentally prepared to encounter this attitude, and to ‘move on’.”

Also, several current or former service members told investigators they were told to ignore the behaviour.

They were told that if they witnessed child sexual abuse, “they should let the local officials or police know and not interfere with the locals,” the report said. “The interviewee said that the reason given as to why not to interfere was due to maintaining cooperation with the Afghans”.

Another interviewee told investigators that the chain of command didn’t care until The New York Times reported on the issue.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1588201,11/2/20 13:17,"Underage marriage: 13-year-old Arzoo recovered after SHC orders, says Wahab","Arzoo, a teenage Christian girl who was allegedly abducted before being forcefully converted and married to a Muslim man, has been recovered, Sindh government spokesperson Murtaza Wahab announced through a tweet on Monday evening.

Speaking to Dawn.com, acting Karachi police chief Additional IG Arif Hanif confirmed that the 13-year-old girl had been recovered safely and her purported husband had also been arrested.

The city police chief said the girl would be sent to a shelter home as per the directions of the Sindh High Court (SHC) while the suspect would be presented before the court on Tuesday.

Earlier in the day, the SHC had ordered the police to recover Arzoo and shift her to a shelter home.

""The judge has ordered the girl be recovered by police and relevant agencies and shifted to a shelter home. Next hearing fixed for Thursday morning [November 5]. My lawyer has informed the court that an intervener will be filed on my behalf,"" Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari said in a tweet.

Activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir — who is part of the legal team fighting the case on behalf of Arzoo's parents — also confirmed the development, adding that the SHC had directed that the girl be produced before the court at the next hearing. Speaking to Dawn.com, he said the court in the meantime has ordered that a medical test be conducted to determine the girl's age.

The court noted that issues to be addressed are the girl's age, whether she was forcibly converted and if her marriage is legal, he said.

""I trust the Sindh government and the police would use all resources at their disposal"" to recover Arzoo, he said.

""To save our children, the government, judiciary, lawyers, civil society and the media should all be on the same page. We all need to play our respective roles effectively,"" he said.

""Glad both the Sindh government and the federal government want to pursue #JusticeForArzoo. There is a lot to learn from the injustices committed in this case first by the accused and then by our governance system. With both governments on board hope this case will become ground for renewed focus on child rights,"" he added.

Sindh government spokesperson Wahab added that the court had issued the directives on an application filed by the provincial government.

Sindh Governor Imran Ismail said Arzoo's case would be solved according to the law. ""There can be no compromise on cases involving underage marriage,"" he said while meeting representatives of minority communities at the Governor House.

The alleged abduction of 13-year-old Arzoo last month had sparked protests from human rights groups against her purported forced conversion and underage marriage with a Muslim man.

According to the first information report of the case registered on his complaint, Arzoo's father Raja stated that on October 13, he and his wife went to work while their son Shahbaz had gone to school. The complainant said his three daughters, including Arzoo, were present at their home in Railway Colony when he received a call from a relative, who told him that Arzoo was missing from the house.

Raja said he reached home and contacted their neighbours, but could not trace his daughter. He subsequently lodged a case regarding the abduction of his daughter against unknown persons at the Frere police station.

Arzoo's family members earlier this month told Dawn that her purported husband Azhar lived in a house opposite theirs along with his family and he was at least 45-years-old. ""The rascal who abducted her has prepared fake papers to show that she is 18-years-old,” her mother said.

Police had booked Syed Ali Azhar, the girl's alleged husband, and arrested his brothers, Syed Shariq Ali, Syed Mohsin Ali, and a friend, Danish, for allegedly abducting the underage girl, purportedly forcibly converting her and marrying her to a Muslim man.

On Saturday, a judicial magistrate had dismissed an application filed by Arzoo's family pleading to send her to a shelter home. Arzoo's father had filed an application under Rule 5 of the Child Marriages Restraint Rules read with Rules 8, 9 and 10 of the Child Marriages Restrain Act, 2013 and Section 100 of the criminal procedure code.

Nasir had argued that girl was 13, therefore, the provisions of the Sindh Child Marriages Restrain Act had also been incorporated in the matter by the investigating agency.

He had argued that the relevant documents concerning the victim's age had already been provided by the complainant to the investigating officer and the same were showing her age as 13 years.

Nasir had contended that further stay of the victim with suspect Azhar would amount to an offence punishable under Section 376 (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 375(v) (rape: with or without her consent when she is under sixteen years of age).

He had said that the complainant was not even asking for the custody of the victim, as he had no objection sending her to a shelter home for DNA testing and other requirements for the investigation.

The investigating officer in the case, Inspector Shariq Ahmed Siddiqui, had stated that the victim had appeared before the SHC and was sent under the protection of the SHO of the Preedy police station in compliance with the court's Oct 27 order.

He said he had called in verification of the victim's B-form, which as per the National Database and Registration Authority, was genuine.","['Dawn.Com', 'Imtiaz Ali', 'Vivek Lahore', 'Peer Baba Khwajaji', 'Iftikhar Husain', 'Surya Kant', 'Nitin Saini', 'M.

The special court would work at the Lahore Judicial Complex with an additional district & sessions judge as its presiding judge.

Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, Chief Justice Shah regretted that the Supreme Court had in 2013 clearly issued direction for the establishment of such courts but the matter was delayed.

The CJ said women were the most vulnerable members of society as one of every three women in Punjab was victim of violence –physical, mental or domestic.

He admitted that the traditional courts failed to dispense justice among women in the society. He said the women had not been provided a friendly environment and a sense of protection in courts.

“We have to care about our mothers, sisters and daughters,” the CJ added.

Now, he said, victims (women) of violence would be able to defend their cases in a protected environment and could record statements in a separate room on video link. He said: “We have not changed any system but adopted a modern mechanism.”

Justice Shah said soon a special court to deal with children-related cases would also be opened. He also called for a supportive role from the legal fraternity to make the special court a success.

He said training courses for judges on gender sensitivity had already been commenced at Punjab Judicial Academy.

Justice Sardar Shamim, Justice Alia Neelum, Registrar Khurshid Anwar Rizvi, Lahore District & Sessions Judge Abid Qureshi, Lahore Bar Association President Chaudhry Tanvir Hussain and representatives of Asian Development Bank were also present at the event.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1049079/judge-strikes-down-smoking-ban-in-ny-state-parks,10/12/13 7:05,Judge strikes down smoking ban in NY state parks,"NEW YORK, Oct 11: A US judge has ordered an end to a smoking ban imposed in public parks and beaches across New York state last February.

The ruling applies to 179 parks across the state, as well as beaches, sporting grounds, picnic spots, camping areas and historic sites run by the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.

A New York-based group, Citizens Lobbying Against Smoker Harrassment (C.L.A.S.H), had challenged the ban, on the grounds that parks had exceeded their authority.

New York State Supreme Court Justice George Ceresia ruled in their favour, declaring that the state parks agency had “extended their reach beyond interstitial rulemaking and into the realm of legislating.” C.L.A.S.H on Thursday welcomed what it called a vindication of individual freedoms.

“This is putting the prohibitionists on notice that, despite their ugly war being waged on adults who choose to smoke, they are not entitled to a free-for-all in governing when it comes to this segment of society,” said its founder Audrey Silk.

It has been illegal to smoke in bars, restaurants and work places in New York state for the last 10 years.

In New York City it is also illegal to smoke on public beaches, parks and public swimming pools since 2011.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1377377,12/18/17 21:50,15-year-old maid allegedly assaulted by employer in Karachi,"A 15-year-old domestic helper was allegedly tortured by her employer in Bahadurabad area in Karachi where she has been working for the past one-and-a-half years, police and her father said on Monday.

The girl was working as a domestic help at the house of a local builder in Kokan Society located on Alamgir Road.

District East SSP Dr Samiullah Soomro told Dawn that police on Monday received an application by the girl’s father, through a courier service, in which he alleged that his daughter had been assaulted by the house owner.

The senior officer said that the family has not formally approached the police to get a first information report (FIR) registered, so a medical examination of the girl was yet to be done in connection with ascertaining the veracity of the allegations.

SSP Soomro said that around four months ago the house owner had moved a complaint before Bahadurabad police station, alleging that his house helper had stolen over Rs80,000 but he did not get the FIR registered.

Subsequently, both the parties agreed to ""settle"" the matter without the intervention of the police, he said, adding that parents of the girl had taken her away following the settlement.

However, on Monday, the girl’s father alleged before the media that the house owner had threatened and compelled him to sign on blank papers in the presence of police.

The girl's father said that when he brought his daughter to their home in Qayumabad her health condition started deteriorating, whereas, she, according to her father, disclosed that she was subjected to criminal assault by the house owner.

The employer also allegedly administered injections to her and the signs of administrating injections were visible on her hands, the father claimed.

The victim's father further clarified that he did not approach the police directly because he did not expect justice from them as he had already been threatened in the presence of several policemen to get the issue “settled.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1493337/boy-girl-gunned-down-for-honour-by-family,7/11/19 6:53,"Boy, girl gunned down for ‘honour’ by family","GUJRAT: A boy and a girl were allegedly gunned down for honour by the father and two other suspects from the girl’s family in Rajjar area of Sarai Alamgir Sadar on Wednesday.

The girl was said to have an affair with a boy from the same village against the wishes of their families and they both had fled to Karachi a few days ago. However, her father convinced them that the family had forgiven them and they should return home.

When the two returned, the girl’s father Muhammad Anwar Jutt along with Ihsan and Zaraat allegedly gunned down the couple.

Police shifted the bodies to the Kharian Tehsil Headquarters Hospital for autopsy, while three suspects were detained and an investigation started.

MURDER CASE SOLVED: Police claimed to have resolved the murder case of an expatriate Pakistani, as his wife turned out to be his killer to marry another man in Mararian village.

Asad Gujjar, a spokesman for Gujrat police, said that Sajjad Shah had lodged a complaint with the police on July 9, saying that his nephew, Yasir Shah, had recently returned from Saudi Arabia. A few days later the nephew’s wife Sana Liaqat told the family that Yasir had died of a heart attack.

However, he suspected that his nephew had been murdered. Police later detained Sana, who confessed during investigation to have killed her husband through asphyxiation after intoxicating him on June 11. She added that she loved another man, who along with two accomplices had helped her in the killing.

Police registered a case against the suspects and arrested those nominated in the case. Now, police will approach a local court for exhumation of Yasir’s body to conduct an autopsy so that the cause of death could be ascertained.

Samples from the body will be sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency for analysis.

“The Government of Pak­istan extends due respect and courtesies and expects that the foreign envoys conform to the established diplomatic norms and principles,” the FO stated while rejecting the Afghan foreign ministry’s assertion of “mistreatment” of its envoy.

The Afghan foreign ministry had earlier alleged that its Ambassador in Islamabad Atif Mashal was summoned by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and conduct of “the entity’s personnel” was in “contradiction with diplomatic norms and principles”. The Afghan foreign ministry had not mentioned when the incident took place.

The war of words between Islamabad and Kabul over the alleged harassment of diplomats began on Sunday when Pakistan government said that officers and staff of Pakistan embassy in Kabul were “obstructed on the road and the embassy vehicles were also hit by motorcycles while going towards the embassy”. The consular section of Pakistan embassy later suspended its services.

Afghan Charge d Affaires was summoned to the FO for conveying “serious concerns” over the safety and security of the personnel of Pakistan’s diplomatic missions in Afghanistan.

The latest FO statement pointed towards continuing harassment of Pakistani diplomats and embassy staff as it said the incidents had been happening for the past few days.

“We urge the Afghan authorities to take immediate steps to ensure safety and security of the personnel of Pakistan’s diplomatic Missions in Afghanistan,” the FO added.

The Afghan foreign ministry’s statement had earlier pledged to “seriously investigate” the alleged harassment of Pakistan embassy personnel and offered assurance to provide safety to them.

https://www.dawn.com/news/841598,2/11/09 0:00,Police Order revisited,"POLICE Order 2002 was introduced with much gusto. Its avowed purpose was to reinvent the police so it could prevent and detect crime more efficiently and maintain public order. The central idea was to transform the police department into a professional, service-oriented force that would be accountable to the people.

After six years of half-hearted implementation, the future of Police Order 2002 has become uncertain. Certain circles are arguing that the order should be repealed and the system made to revert to its original status. Interestingly, the move to rescind the law is not supported by insightful debate or deliberation on its efficacy or flaws. Instead, the focus appears to be on backdoor manipulation.

Politics is the root cause behind the move to repeal Police Order 2002 and we would be well advised not to fall for this deliberate diversion. Any decision on retaining or abolishing the Police Order in part or in toto has to be made keeping in view administrative considerations and the usefulness of its provisions. The sensible course would be to identify existing problems and address those issues through legal channels in accordance with the law of the land.

It may be helpful to look at the salient features of Police Order 2002. Under the order, the police establishment was reorganised separating investigation from the operations branch, which may not have been the ideal option. It laid down procedures for the appointment and removal of a provincial police officer on merit and gave him financial powers as an ex officio secretary to the provincial government, enabling him to decide matters expeditiously without stumbling over bureaucratic bottlenecks.

It gave security of tenure to the chiefs of police in districts, capital cities and provinces so they could not be removed arbitrarily. Public safety commissions and police complaints authorities were set up to ensure public participation in policing. It is a pity that these provisions were not implemented in their entirety. However, the district police officer was effectively freed from the general direction and control of the meddlesome district magistrate.

It would be appropriate to objectively evaluate the working of the new police system. To what extent has it achieved its declared objectives and what are the pitfalls in the system? This assessment must be carried out in a fair and impartial manner if the aim is to create a professional police organisation that can successfully meet the challenge of controlling law and order. Changes should not be suggested merely to serve the vested interests of a particular group.

It is argued by proponents of the old system that the force under the new Police Order has become too autonomous and there is no institution to check its unbridled authority. The fact is that the new law puts more stringent checks on the police. They are accountable within their own hierarchy, to the elected nazim, the judiciary, the public safety commissions and the Public Complaints Authority. Furthermore, there are penal provisions for misconduct.

The bureaucracy and the politicians want to assume control of the police. Much of the clamour for rolling back the new police laws is motivated by this consideration. The question we need to ask is this is the driving force a desire to check police excesses and make

the force accountable for its conduct, or do the critics simply want to gain control over the police for ulterior motives?

Under the Police Act 1861, the district superintendent worked under the general direction and control of the district magistrate (DM). The bureaucracy exercised immense influence because of this provision. A district magistrate or his subordinate executive magistrates never succeeded in checking the reprehensible behaviour of the police. On the contrary, they provided legal cover to police excesses. Ordinary people suffered immensely because of this complicity between the local police officer and local executive magistrate.

Subordination of the police to the DM is against the universally accepted principle of separation of powers. Under the previous system, the police, magistracy and prosecution were controlled by a DM. This resulted in lack of transparency and objectivity.When the government of the day wanted to arm-twist a certain political group, the police would round up its members on the DM's orders. The Sub-divisional District Magistrate (SDM), acting on the policy laid down by the DM, would grant physical remand and refuse bail. The prosecutor would push the case in compliance with the directions of the same officer and an amenable magistrate would award punishment. This made for a travesty of justice.

In all fairness it has to be acknowledged that all is not well with the current police system either. The public has not experienced discernible change with the enforcement of Police Order 2002. There has been no decrease in crime and police behaviour has not changed. Still, a failure to deliver the goods does not mean that the new police system was inherently flawed.

The failures we see can be attributed primarily to hasty and incomplete implementation. The system was changed overnight without preparing the ground for a drastic overhaul. It should have been done in phases and supplemented with training and other initiatives. Secondly, not all the provisions were implemented. For instance, the new law gave the provincial and district police chiefs security of tenure. This was never put in place. Citizens' bodies including the public safety commissions were not made functional in most cases. The Public Complaints Authority could never take off.No system is perfect and what we have at present is not without its flaws. Nor was the previous system unblemished. But this does not mean that the solution lies in blindly reverting to the old set-up. Instead of placing the police under the control of the bureaucracy, police reforms should try to make the force accountable to the public, rid it of political interference, introduce meritocracy, modernise policing methods and introduce operational independence.

Provisions of law that have hampered police working, like the watertight compartmentalisation of the operations and investigation branches, need to be done away with to ensure smooth working, coordination and interdependence of the two branches of police.The focus of the reforms should be the police station which is the basic unit of the organisation. The public perception about the police is shaped by the treatment citizens receive at the police-station level. Respect for human rights, crime prevention and detection, overall service delivery and better police-community relations can only be achieved if the police stations are effectively reformed. Bureaucratic control is not likely to achieve this.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1402150,6/23/18 14:21,When is the right time to start talking to children about sexual abuse?,"The writer is a clinical psychologist and has worked for 19 years with children and adults in Pakistan especially on trauma and violence.

Age-appropriate communication with children about child sexual abuse is among one of the key protective measures that adults can undertake.

The implications of not giving age-appropriate information and transferring skills to children can be very damaging.

Silence on this issue can perpetuate further abuse, and leave children suffering over long periods of time for something that can be stopped with timely intervention.

Having worked in Pakistan with both child and adult survivors of sexual abuse, I observed that individuals who were provided basic body protection information as children or timely support by adults after an incident reported fewer clinical complications than those who disclosed abuse for the first time during therapy.

An oft-asked question is about when, what and how to broach this subject with children so that they are not left feeling scared and overwhelmed.

What is the right age to start the conversation?

Having conducted awareness sessions with children of all ages, I found that the more comfortable, open and engaging an adult was, the more comfortable a child became in speaking and openly asking questions.

Children as young as three years old can learn basic age-appropriate information and skills. The right information about body safety and the opportunity to practice skills for dealing with potentially abusive situations are two important aspects of an effective awareness programme for children.

Children aged 3 to 5 years need to learn the basics, i.e. the difference between a good, bad and secret touch; the role of feelings in determining this difference; what to do and most importantly which adult to tell.

Confidently saying ‘no’, shouting out for help, talking to a trusted adult are some of the skills practiced with children.

Stories through books, puppets and cartoons can further reinforce this information.

For children aged 5 to 7 years, basic information about bodily rights, private parts, difference between safe and unsafe situations, assertive communication skills and practice of skills through role-plays should be additionally covered.

An important thing taught to children is to identify more than one person who they can talk to, just in case an adult is unavailable or is unable to believe them. This helps build a support network for children.

Since anyone can be an abuser, with most being someone that the child knows, the emphasis of information should be on the abuse itself, regardless of who the person is.

For children older than 7 years, some myths should be clarified. For example, children should know that abusers are rarely strangers or that boys can also be sexually abused, or that abusers do not always physically threaten children but lure through affection and gifts.

What kind of information should be shared?

Various forms of abuse including vulnerability through cyberspace should be shared with children. Teenagers, for example, should be provided additional information about consent and respect in relationships.

Children with special needs should not be left out of these discussions, since evidence indicates them being more vulnerable to sexual abuse.

Being vigilant and aware of the adults around the child and their nature of interaction with them can be a helpful and protective measure, especially for those with mental disabilities.

Most importantly, no matter what the age, children need to be clearly and repeatedly told that the fault for the abuse does not lie with them, even if they have accepted gifts, enjoyed the abuser’s company, or could not say ‘no’, etc.

Building children’s overall self-esteem, providing them opportunities to express their opinions and think critically can be considered as important foundations for the work on body protection for both girls and boys.

The importance of two-way communication

Providing information through open, two-way communication that allows children to share their views and feelings about the issue is extremely critical. This allows adults to find out what children already know and what needs to be clarified.

When adults give this information in the form of a lecture, or in a manner where children sense that the onus of responsibility for preventing abuse lies on them, there are more chances that they will not disclose such incidents.

Explore: Keeping quiet on sexual abuse is hurting your children

Adults may not always be around and children may not always be able to speak to adults due to feelings of shame, fear, helplessness, and their relationship with the abuser.

Always try and take out time to talk to children about their day-to-day activities, their feelings, their challenges and achievements.

This can further create an overall atmosphere of trust and confidence enabling them to talk about difficult issues.

How to identify signs of sexual abuse in children

There is no single indicator of sexual abuse, since abuse can be of many different forms and may affect children differently.

However, any sudden change in a child’s behaviour, academic performance, sleep, appetite or emotions, for which no other reason can be found, should alert an adult to the possibility of sexual abuse.

In addition, age-inappropriate sexual information, sexual acting-out with peers, toys, adults, and inexplicable bruises or marks on the body should also be investigated.

Related: Tackling child sexual abuse: awareness, identification and prevention

Adults often feel anger, guilt and helplessness at a child’s disclosure of abuse. Blaming the child, scolding her for not revealing the issue earlier or asking her to not discuss or forget about it are unhelpful and detrimental responses.

Sensitive and effective ways to respond to a child’s disclosure of the abuse include listening openly, appreciating and not blaming the child, and normalising the feelings evoked by abuse.

Necessary steps for ensuring the child’s safety should also be taken. For example, helping him develop a safety plan in case he comes across the same situation, confronting or reporting the abuser, and blocking access of the abuser.

This becomes complicated when the abuser is related to the child. However, calling out on the abuse and taking safety measures are essential.

If critical thinking, values, self-confidence and life skills are essential for children’s personality, then bodily safety and protection should be seen as part and parcel of that development.

While the need for effective laws, sensitive reporting and response mechanisms in Pakistan cannot be denied, it would be negligent not to do our bit by empowering children through basic safety and protective measures.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1533984,2/12/20 7:00,Sindh police law,"POST 18th Amendment, some quarters have questioned the status and validity of Police Order (PO) 2002 as a strictly provincial subject, which has lacked perspective of ground realities. Historically, federal law-enforcement authorities have remained active in maintaining peace in Karachi, which is why evaluating police law exclusively through the prism of provincial autonomy doesn’t seem appropriate. In a country where criminal law, evidence law and the senior police leadership (PSP) primarily belong to the federal structure — owing to internal security challenges and resource constraints faced by the provinces — it is difficult to clearly demarcate federal and provincial domains.

Even prior to the ongoing Rangers-led operation in Karachi, the city depended on federal reinforcements. Likewise, KP and Balochistan sought federal financing for law-enforcement projects such as conversion of ‘B’ into ‘A’ areas, raising the Balochistan Constabulary and the integration of forces of former Fata into the KP police.

In May 2019, the Sindh Assembly passed an amended bill; as per Article 116 (2A) it was forwarded to the governor. Following Article 116(2-B), the governor returned the bill for reconsideration to the Assembly. In June 2019, it was reconsidered, passed and forwarded to him. Since the governor did not assent within the 10 days specified in Article 116(3), the bill was deemed as passed.

The new law is known as the Sindh (Repeal of the Police Act, 1861 and Revival of Police Order 2002) Amendment Act 2019, and contains several flaws, eg the adopted law merged the previously exclusive public safety commissions and complaints commissions as a single entity. Meanwhile, Article 4 defines 22 duties of the police, including assistance to victims — but without increasing financial allocation, capacity building, and accountability; such an exhaustive list will remain an ideal. Then, Article 8 requires police departments to be organised on a functional basis, but the new law dropped the idea of ‘police accountability’ incorporated in Article 8 (2-E) in the original PO 2002. Naturally, without accountability, policing will face a public trust deficit.

How will the logical end be achieved without restructuring the police?

The inherited colonial policing model primarily catered to rural needs, although PO 2002 tried to address issues confronting both rural and urban policing. To meet urban challenges, PO 2002 introduced the concept of Capital City Police (CCP), but the recently adopted law omitted it. For big cities, Sir Oliver Gilbert Grace and Justice Cornelius recommended the commissionerate system in 1950 and 1962, which ensured functional autonomy of the police chief and improved public safety. The police committee headed by Aslam Hayat in 1985 also advised restructuring policing on the lines of a commissionerate system; they believed it would improve decision-making, response and accountability within the police. However, the adopted law seems averse to the needs of metropolitan policing.

In pre-independence Kolkata, the Calcutta Police Act, 1866, provided a way for a commissionerate system. Till independence, the city had 16 police chiefs; and after independence, 26 police commissioners were rotated. Now, Kolkata is the 15th most populated city in the world while Karachi is placed at 11. For Calcutta, the imperialists realised the need for an exclusive commissionerate system, but owing to an intense romance with the colonial-rural policing model, we seem to be enamoured of the status quo. This is apparent in the newly adopted law which has ignored the specific needs of command, operations, capacity building and public safety.

Although the National Action Plan says that the ongoing operation in Karachi will be taken to its logical end, how will that logical end be achieved without empowering and restructuring the police?

The adopted law amended the composition and selection process for members of the provincial and district public safety commissions, and the police complaints commissions. In the original PO 2002, the district public safety commission had eight to 12 members; half the members are to be district councillors, while the remaining are independent members. In the adopted law, one-third are to be elected members of the national and provincial assemblies; one-third district councillors; and the remaining independent members. Historically, district councils remained under the political influence of the party in power.

The enormity of internal security threats warrant that the law incorporate and address the needs of the CCP and reconnect the Sindh police law with the national public safety commission and National Police Bureau. To make the police true custodians of public safety, their composition needs to be amended in a way so that a balanced approach is attained while the IGP is empowered so that he has the exclusive authority to compose his team.

Police told journalists that on Sept 21 a resident of Qandeel Bala village in Madyan filed report that his son took his animals for grazing but he was found dead, hanging from a tree.

“My son took his animals for grazing to the nearby fields in the morning but he did not come back till evening. We went after him and a neigbour informed us that my son’s dead body was hanging from a tree,” said SSP Mohammad Nazir while quoting the father of the murdered boy.

He said that police rushed to the spot after registration of the report and collected evidence with the help of which they arrested some people including a prime suspect. During the initial investigation the prime suspect, a relative of the murdered boy, confessed to his crime, he said.

The SSP said that FIR was registered against the accused under section 302, 377, 53CPA and further investigation was underway from him. He said that 86 murder cases were reported by police in the current year and 75 of those were traced while nine other were untraced.

“We traced the culprits in the nine untraced cases and arrested all the accused in the cases,” he said, adding that the three major cases of robbery were also traced in which the culprits were arrested with recoveries.

The official said that unawareness and lack of responsibility on the part of parents were major causes of sexual harassment and violence. He urged parents to take care of their children and fulfill their responsibilities in that regard.

He said that 86 murder cases were reported by police in the current year and 75 of those were traced while nine other were untraced.","['murder', 'held', 'arrested', 'traced', 'man', 'ssp', 'sept', 'took', 'suspect', 'assault', 'cases', 'report', 'son', 'boy', 'prime']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189f00b83e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0d52ba8a43.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d005917e0.jpg?0.8785461548197806', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1793dc4884.jpg?r=1459847184', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21824a8678.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd179607e531.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189916390d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0ec56aad75.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd22283a73d3.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18a3ece187.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fc7833a64a3a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd17990224f6.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f94d8916a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f4142e469.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24c3aad888.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24e90196c5.jpg', 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}",TRUE,http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'SWAT: Police claimed here on Wednesday to have arrested a man, who killed a 13-year-old boy after sexually ...', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1581289', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Man held over boy assault, murder', 'description': 'SWAT: Police claimed here on Wednesday to have arrested a man, who killed a 13-year-old boy after sexually ...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1581289', 'title': 'Man held over boy assault, murder', 'description': 'SWAT: Police claimed here on Wednesday to have arrested a man, who killed a 13-year-old boy after sexually ...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-09-24 07:17:45', 'modified_time': '2020-09-24 07:17:45', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/391/the-newspaper-s-correspondent'}, 'author': ""The Newspaper's Correspondent""})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1560469/gender-inequalities,6/1/20 7:51,Gender inequalities,"THE coronavirus pandemic is anti-feminist. This seems a strange statement given that evidence suggests that men are worse affected by Covid-19. But in terms of broader social and economic considerations, the pandemic globally is expected to set women back decades. Pakistan’s deeply entrenched misogyny means we’re unlikely to do eno­u­­gh, if anything at all, to stop this backward slide.

The pandemic affects women at multiple levels, starting with significant health imp­acts. Health workers — 70 per cent of whom worldwide are women — are among the most vulnerable to being infected by Covid-19. But the health toll for women extends beyond the coronavirus itself. Previous health crises, such as the Ebola epidemic, have shown that resources are typically diverted to lifesaving health measures from women’s health and reproductive services. The UN has already highlighted that Covid-19 will disrupt its programmes providing family planning support and countering female genital mutilation and child marriage, resulting in millions of unwanted pregnancies, higher maternal mortality rates for years to come, and millions more girls being cut.

The Covid-19 crisis has also put the spotlight on the frequency and intensity of do­­mestic violence around the world — the UN Population Fund in April estimated a 20pc increase in violence during a three-month lockdown period. One can only imagine how much higher this figure would be if accounting for permissive societal attitudes towards domestic violence in countries like Pakistan.

The immediate effect of the virus on women will be in terms of workforce participation. Societal expectations globally means women will be likelier to give up or be fired from jobs as they take on additional caring responsibilities for out-of-school children, the elderly and sick along with mounting housework. Sadly, in patriarchal societies such as ours, this trend will not even be perceived as problematic.

There are sad reminders of how deeply rooted misogyny is.

It doesn’t help that women’s current positioning within the global economy will force them to opt out faster than men. The ILO reports that globally women represent 40pc of total employment, but make up 57pc of the cadre of part-time workers; 69pc of low earners are women. In South Asia, over 80pc of women who don’t work in agriculture are in informal employment, including domestic work and piece-rate manufacturing jobs. These are the workers most likely to lose their jobs and fail to qualify for government job protection schemes.

Women in formal employment also dominate in sectors worst-hit by the pandemic: air travel, tourism, retail, hospitality, catering. Citigroup last month estimated that globally, 220 million women are in sectors vulnerable to massive job cuts.

This does not mean that women’s economic contribution is expendable. Citigroup has also estimated $1 trillion could be lost from global growth as a result of women falling out of the workforce. The cost will be palpable in places like Pakistan, where the labour underutilisation rate for women pre-pandemic was already as high as 80pc, and where the IMF has estimated GDP would increase by one-third if women’s labour participation equalled that of men.

The world — especially emerging economies like Pakistan — cannot afford the in­­e­v­itable gender inequalities and pay gap that will result from this pandemic. That’s why development agencies are urging governments to take a gender-sensitive appro­ach to managing the pandemic and its economic consequences. This means focusing on saving jobs in the health, education and hospitality sectors (that employ women) and not only in male-intensive sectors such as construction.

Governments are also being asked to extend support to informal, part-time and seasonal workers, who are mostly women, and revisit maternity, flexible working, and sick pay policies, which could help retain women in employment.

This is asking a lot in a country where the prime minister recently sat silently by while a cleric blamed immodest women for causing the pandemic by eliciting God’s wrath. Or where in March the Aurat March was accused of obscenity. Or where parliamentarians routinely use sexist and threatening language to address their peers.

Two social media scandals this week have been sad reminders of how deep-seated Pakistani misogyny is. One especially disgusting meme suggests that a property tycoon will give a model who has filed harassment charges against his daughters a plot in a residential development — the accompanying image is that of a grave. Another Twitter firestorm depicts rape as a punishment for adulterous women. Such casual references to gender-based homicide and sexual violence seem acceptable in our public sphere, and indicate the low stature of women in our society. The socioeconomic ravages of the pandemic layered over entrenched patriarchy threaten to designate women as a permanent under-class. Will our government take action to prevent this?

https://www.dawn.com/news/1506224,9/20/19 7:04,Seven children are abused daily in Pakistan: report,"LAHORE: From January to June in the current year, 1,304 cases of sexual abuse of children have been reported by the media in the country, which means that at least seven children are abused daily, reveals in a report released by a child rights organisation, Sahil.

According to the report released at the Lahore Press Club on Thursday, the data from January to June in 2019 reveals that 729 girls and 575 boys became victims of sexual exploitation. The cases under major categories included 378 of abduction, 139 of rape, 153 of sodomy, 46 of gang rape, 88 of gang sodomy whereas 12 boys and four girls have been murdered after sexual abuse.

In 2018, there were 3,307 such incidents reported to police, 39 cases were not reported and 56 cases were not registered. Around 430 cases were reported by newspapers with incomplete information.

In Lahore only, there were 50 incidents reported last year while nine children had been abducted and 12 reported missing from January to June 2019. January to June data gave grim numbers as it included five incidents of rape, seven of sodomy, three of gang rape and five of gang sodomy.

Ansar Sajjad Bhatti, the senior regional coordinator of Sahil, said there were other incidents in which three boys and as many girls were murdered after gang rape, sodomy and rape, 186 children were found missing from their homes while there were 40 cases of early child marriage and one case of Vani.

The most common perpetrator of the child sex abuse was an acquaintance with the victim and the victim’s family. Out of a total of 1,304 cases, 614 cases were such where the abusers had acquaintance with victims or victim’s family. In all, 142 cases were reported in which strangers were involved in abusing children.

Most victims (414) were between 11 and 15 years old, followed by 5 to 10 years old (171 cases), and 16 to 18 years old (117 cases). The youngest age group one to five years old had the least number of cases (75). In 401 cases, the age of victims was not mentioned in newspapers.

In total, 203 children have been abused in their own places, 300 at an acquaintance’s place, four in a haveli, 12 in a madrassa, three at their workplace and 162 in open places, including fields, streets and forests. Punjab had the most cases of sexual abuse (652), followed by Sindh (458), Federal (90), KP (51), Balochistan (32), AJK (18) and GB (3).

Mr Bhatti said Sahil’s recommendations included an awareness campaign for protection of children from child abuse, introduction of a new legislation and a guarantee of implementation of enforced enactments, as well as a comprehensive rehabilitation/support system for the victims. He said messages of self-protection should be included in the school curriculum while a provincial plan of action against child sexual abuse and exploitation must be drafted by the government.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1532268,2/3/20 23:23,"3 Pakistanis, Macedonian man charged for allegedly holding migrants to ransom","Authorities in North Macedonia have filed criminal charges against three Pakistanis and a Macedonian man for allegedly imprisoning a group of migrants and holding them to ransom, officials said on Monday.

The prosecutor’s office said the men were believed to have behaved in a “particularly degrading and cruel” manner to the 12 migrants, including two minors, from India, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

They were allegedly detained for two weeks in October in a house in the country’s north. The four suspects were arrested last year but the arrests were announced on Monday.

According to the prosecution, the suspects “caused [the migrants] to lose their sense of time, gave them food only once a day and physically abused them”. They also allegedly demanded money from their prisoners’ relatives in other European countries and threatened to kill the migrants when they asked to be freed.

One migrant managed to contact relatives who reported the case to Serbian authorities, who in turn informed police in North Macedonia, the prosecutor’s office said.

The three Pakistanis were arrested and are in custody pending trial. If convicted, they face up to eight years in prison. The Macedonian national, who owns the house where the migrants were allegedly being held, has also been charged and is under house arrest.

North Macedonia is a key stage on the route many migrants take through the Balkans towards prosperous European countries after illegally entering neighbouring Greece — mostly on small smuggling boats from Turkey.

On the Greek island of Lesbos, where most of the boats arrive, migrants clashed with police on Monday during a protest over severe overcrowding at the local Moria camp and delays in Greece’s asylum procedure.

Riot police used tear gas to disperse several hundred protesters who had planned to march from the camp to the island capital of Mytilene, about 5 kilometres (3.1 miles) away. No arrests or injuries were reported.

Also on Monday, police in Cyprus said they safely escorted to the coastal town of Larnaca a boat with 87 Syrian migrants that had left from the Turkish port of Mersin and was spotted by radar off the island nation’s southeastern tip.

The 61 men, 10 women and 16 children were taken to a reception centre outside the capital Nicosia.","['A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1457784/steps-urged-to-control-gender-based-violence,1/16/19 7:12,Steps urged to control gender-based violence,"PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Commission on the Status of Women has condemned the murder of a ninth grader girl and stressed the need for a comprehensive approach to combat gender-based violence.

In a statement here on Tuesday, KPCSW expressed grave concerns over rise in murders of girls and women in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other provinces.

It said that the rising trend of rape and killing of minors required urgent action on part of relevant departments.

The KPCSW said that 51 women had been murdered, 21 committed suicide while nine had been assaulted between July and December 2018.

“In the first two weeks of January 2019, there have been eight cases of murder and rape of minors,” it added.

The statement said that sexual violence was seldom reported as the victims were either silenced in the name of honour or killed by their own families.

“These are grave violations of human rights and can only be combated by addressing the root causes of such crimes -- gender inequality and discrimination. The effective and timely implementation of laws is a prerequisite of justice,” it added.

KPCSW recognises the efforts of KP police in tracking the culprits on the priority basis, the efforts of media to highlight such cases and the struggle of civil society organisations to create awareness among people and work with government to eradicate such violence.

“However, the entire system starting with reporting, prosecution, sentencing, shelters and post shelter integration requires strengthening,” said the statement.

It said that a comprehensive approach involving relevant government departments along with the government commissions for children, information and right to services as well as civil society was must to work on a practical roadmap for arresting and reversing those trends.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1532136/dubai-consulate-seeks-action-against-companies-allegedly-involved-in-human-trafficking,2/3/20 7:11,Dubai consulate seeks action against companies allegedly involved in human trafficking,"ISLAMABAD: The Consulate General of Pakistan in Dubai has written to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment seeking action against nine companies allegedly involved in trafficking people from Pakistan to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The letter was written in response to complaints by Pakistani citizens living and working in Dubai. Signed by Community Welfare Attaché Saulat Saqib and available with Dawn, the letter informed the FIA that Pakistani citizens have filed applications against companies and agents that they claim are running fake companies in the UAE.

“They issued fake offer letters and visa approvals and charged huge amount from the applicants for their jobs in UAE,” it said.

The letter added: “It is requested to look into the matter and take necessary action for redressal of grievances of the applicants as per rules and procedure, under intimation to this mission.”

Letter to FIA, Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment sent in response to complaint by Pakistani citizens living, working in Dubai

The companies mentioned in the letter include Loyal Force Security, Al Nasir Al Byad Security, Najam Al Falak Security, NAS Security Services, Nokta Technical Services, Red Falcon Facility Management and Jehlam Technical Services.

The issue is very sensitive because a large number of Pakistani citizens suffer at the hands of fake agents, PTI MNA Ali Awan from Islamabad told Dawn.

“As I have been in the travel agency business for two decades, I am well aware of the miseries of the people who spend their life savings to travel abroad and in the end are deprived of everything,” he said.

“A number of Pakistanis are hired on promises that they will be get handsome salaries, medical, residential and other facilities, but after reaching they are shocked to see that none of the promises are fulfilled. Some Pakistanis even find that the companies that hired them practically do not exist,” Mr Awan went on.

To a question, he said that the PTI government was in the process of introducingan automated system that people can use to verify the status of recruiting agents. He said there was a list which mentions which agents “are reliable and which are not trustworthy”.

FIA Deputy Director Immigration Sajid Khokhar said that the agency has set up an Anti-Human Trafficking Cell that is involved in finding agents who deprive citizens of their money.

“Whenever a complaint is reviewed, not only are cases registered against the agents or recruiting agencies but strict action is also taken as no one can be allowed to recruit Pakistani citizens and then leave them on their own in the UAE or any other country,” he said.

In response to a question, he said that people cannot be stopped at airports as they travel on genuine visas and it is not possible to confirm whether the company they are going to work for exists.

“We work as a check post and only check the documentation. However zero tolerance is shown whenever such complaints are received,” he said.

The letter was written in response to complaints by Pakistani citizens living and working in Dubai.
Signed by Community Welfare Attaché Saulat Saqib and available with Dawn, the letter informed the FIA that Pakistani citizens have filed applications against companies and agents that they claim are running fake companies in the UAE.
The issue is very sensitive because a large number of Pakistani citizens suffer at the hands of fake agents, PTI MNA Ali Awan from Islamabad told Dawn.
Some Pakistanis even find that the companies that hired them practically do not exist,” Mr Awan went on.","['action', 'agents', 'seeks', 'fia', 'consulate', 'pakistani', 'involved', 'trafficking', 'companies', 'human', 'fake', 'citizens', 'travel', 'response', 'security', 'allegedly', 'letter', 'dubai']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/02/5e379efec5cb7.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd29e77ecee6.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2eaf72ea17.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e4d6d7c0e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd22283a73d3.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1a195e7829.png?r=620371018', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/02/5e379efec5cb7.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24c3aad888.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24e90196c5.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/02/5e379efec5cb7.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': '“We work as a check post and only check the documentation,"" says FIA deputy director.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1532136', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Dubai consulate seeks action against companies allegedly involved in human trafficking', 'description': '“We work as a check post and only check the documentation,"" says FIA deputy director.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/02/5e379efec5cb7.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1532136', 'title': 'Dubai consulate seeks action against companies allegedly involved in human trafficking', 'description': '“We work as a check post and only check the documentation,"" says FIA deputy director.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/02/5e379efec5cb7.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-02-03 07:11:51', 'modified_time': '2020-02-03 09:29:19', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/263/ikram-junaidi'}, 'author': 'Ikram Junaidi'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1113127,6/16/14 17:55,Britain bans forced marriage,"LONDON: British legislation banning forced marriage came into effect on Monday, with those found guilty of the largely hidden practice facing up to seven years in prison.

The law applies not only within Britain but also makes it a criminal offence to force a British national into a marriage abroad, as many youngsters are flown out to weddings in their ancestral homelands, particularly in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.

Nearly two-thirds of the cases dealt with by the government's Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) relate to Britain's South Asian communities.

Campaigners welcomed the new laws as a “huge step forward”, while the government hopes they will protect potential victims.

A practice wrecking the lives of unknown thousands of British-born youths, forced marriage has been increasingly exposed in the last decade.

“Forced marriage is a tragedy for each and every victim, and its very nature means that many cases go unreported,” said Home Secretary Theresa May.

“I am proud to say that the UK is already a world leader in the fight to stamp out this harmful practice with the government's FMU working hard to tackle this terrible practice in the UK and overseas.

“Today's criminalisation is a further move by this government to ensure victims are protected by the law and that they have the confidence, safety and the freedom to choose. “Last year, the FMU dealt with some 1,300 cases, 18 per cent of them men.

Forty per cent of victims were aged 17 or under; three quarters were aged under 22.

Officials fear the number of victims coming forward is just the tip of the iceberg.

Meanwhile charities say few leaders with influence in their communities are prepared to take a stand, for fear of losing their support base.

The cases related to 74 different countries, although 43 per cent were linked to Pakistan, 11 per cent to India and 10 per cent to Bangladesh.

Other countries with multiple cases included Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iran and Tunisia.

The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said children as young as 12 had contacted them about forced marriage, with the numbers calling up two-thirds in the last year.

The charity's Ash Chand called the new law “a huge step forward which we hope will deter those plotting against their own children.

“Many young people who call our ChildLine service about this issue are frightened, concerned and feel control of their lives is being wrenched from them. “","['Salim A', 'Moiz Omar', 'Mohammad Akhtar', 'Hani Abidi', 'Dr Abdul Shakoor Bhatti', 'Dr. Sehar Khan', 'Gerry Carman', 'Usman Khalid', 'Jude Allen', 'Sharjeel Bin Afzal']","LONDON: British legislation banning forced marriage came into effect on Monday, with those found guilty of the largely hidden practice facing up to seven years in prison.

According to a statement issued by the FO spokesperson, Dr Mohammad Faisal, ""serious concerns"" were conveyed over the safety and security of the diplomatic personnel working at the embassy.

""The Afghan Cd’A was informed that the officers and staff of the Embassy of Pakistan were being harassed over the past two days. They were obstructed on the road and the Embassy vehicles were also hit by motorcycles while going towards the Embassy,"" said the statement.

The Cd'A was reminded of the Afghanistan government's responsibility, as a party to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities 1961, of ensuring ""safety, security and freedom of movement to all members of the Mission.""

The Cd’A was reminded that being party to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities 1961, it is the responsibility of the Government of Afghanistan to ensure safety, security and freedom of movement to all members of the Mission"".

He was asked to relay Pakistan's concerns with Afghan authorities and to urge them ""to immediately investigate these security violations and harassment incidents"".

It was also requested that a report in this regard be shared with Pakistan and that measures are taken to guard against the recurrence of such incidents in the future.

Later in the day, a notification was issued by the Embassy stating its decision to halt operations.

""Due to security reasons, Consular Section of the Embassy of Pakistan, Kabul will be closed from tomorrow, Monday, November 4, until further intimation,"" said the press release.

The incident comes a few weeks after Afghanistan closed its consulate in Peshawar for an indefinite period to protest the removal of its national flag from a disputed area known as Afghan Market.

The FO, in its response had regretted Afghanistan's decision and asked the government to review it. It had also rejec­ted the allegations raised by the Afghan government related to the disputed property.

It explained that the issue about the market was between a private citizen and a purported bank from Afghanistan. It pointed out that a court had decided the matter in favour of the private citizen in 1998.

Last year, at least 280 children were filmed being sexually abused by a gang of 25 men who used the hundreds of videos they produced to blackmail the youngsters' parents.

Most of the victims who are from Husain Khanwala village near Kasur are less than 14-years-old.

Their families had also been blackmailed by the gang since 2009.

The abusers allegedly tried to extort money from parents of victims, selling clips of the videos locally for 40 rupees each if they did not pay up.

A property dispute allegedly brought the issue to the surface.

Activists working to fight child sex abuse in Pakistan said the problem was widespread but difficult to quantify because victims were often unwilling to speak out.

According to a Dawn newspaper report, in recent years, more and more families in Pakistan have dared to speak out against sexual abuse of their children.

But the fight against predators remains in its infancy.

Powerful taboos, gaps in legislation and a lack of awareness continue to fuel a phenomenon that remains hidden, yet deeply embedded within society.","['Dawn.Com', 'Imran Gabol', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

Activists working to fight child sex abuse in Pakistan said the problem was widespread but difficult to quantify because victims were often unwilling to speak out.","['remains', 'child', 'videos', 'pakistan', 'case', 'atc', 'kasur', 'abuse', 'imprisoned', 'speak', 'sex', 'victims', 'convicts', 'life']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'http://i.dawn.com/large/2016/04/5714f41d0e7bd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd329902b790.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/01/569dd6c6a06a9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2015/08/55c998003c5f3.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2015/08/55c8cb1b76dc0.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2015/08/55c8cb1b76dc0.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2015/08/55c998003c5f3.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2016/01/569dd6c6a06a9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg'}",TRUE,http://i.dawn.com/large/2016/04/5714f41d0e7bd.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Both the convicts were also ordered by court to deposit a fine of Rs0.3 million each.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'http://www.dawn.com/news/1252888', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Kasur child abuse case: Two convicts imprisoned for life by ATC', 'description': 'Both the convicts were also ordered by court to deposit a fine of Rs0.3 million each.', 'image': 'http://i.dawn.com/large/2016/04/5714f41d0e7bd.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'http://www.dawn.com/news/1252888', 'title': 'Kasur child abuse case: Two convicts imprisoned for life by ATC', 'description': 'Both the convicts were also ordered by court to deposit a fine of Rs0.3 million each.', 'image': 'http://i.dawn.com/large/2016/04/5714f41d0e7bd.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2016-04-18 19:55:44', 'modified_time': '2016-04-18 20:36:05', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/2505/imran-gabol'}, 'author': 'Dawn.com | Imran Gabol'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1263763,6/9/16 14:06,Hurried funeral for Lahore 'honour killing' victim,"LAHORE: An 18-year-old girl murdered by her mother for marrying the man of her choice was discreetly buried before dawn Thursday by her in-laws, as activists and politicians condemned Pakistan's latest gruesome honour killing.

Zeenat Bibi was set on fire Wednesday in a low-income neighbourhood of Lahore. None of her relatives sought to claim her body, police said Thursday, leaving her new husband's family to bury her charred remains in the dark in a graveyard near the city.

“There was a peace and calm in the area during the funeral prayer and burial,” the officer in charge of the local police station Sheikh Hammad Akhtar told AFP.

Akhtar said the husband, 20-year-old Hasan Khan, had launched a complaint in the killing against his bride's mother, Perveen Bibi, who is in police custody.

The victim's family told AFP how Perveen ran into the street after the murder and began beating her chest, shouting: “People! I have killed my daughter for misbehaving and giving our family a bad name.”

An AFP reporter said Zeenat's family home was closed and locked Thursday.

Neighbour Muhammad Asghar said the family had left, adding: “Why have they gone when everybody is coming to share their grief?”

Hundreds of women are killed in Pakistan each year for so-called “honour”, but it is rare to hear of such atrocities being carried out by women.

Khan said on TV that the couple had eloped, but he had reluctantly allowed Zeenat to return to her family home after they promised they would hold a celebration and not harm her.

Police have also detained one of Perveen's sons-in-law, and are searching for another of her sons. Investigators said they were still awaiting the official results from a post-mortem report.

Rights activists condemned the killing Thursday as Senator Sherry Rehman called for the federal government to detail the steps it was taking to prevent such violence.

“Women continue to face violence in the most atrocious form despite the prevalence of legislation against such acts,” Rehman told the Senate Thursday.

That a family could turn against their own child “shows that there something flawed in law and society”, said Hina Gilani, a human rights activist in Lahore.

“Anybody, whether father, mother, can do it because they have the satisfaction that they can get away with it,” she said.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif vowed to eradicate the “evil” of honour killings after a documentary highlighting the issue won an Oscar in February, but no fresh legislation has been tabled since then.

Last week 19-year-old Maria Sadaqat was tortured then burned alive for refusing a marriage proposal from a school principal's son in Murree.

In April a young woman was strangled and then her body set ablaze because she helped a friend elope in Abbottabad, another case that sparked revulsion.","['Rashid Khan', 'Fudayl Ahmad', 'Iqbal Rangoonwala', 'Imtiaz Ali Khan', 'Bilal S.', 'Srimanta Majumdar', 'M.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1383652,1/18/18 7:23,Child protection,"The writer is an advocate of the high court, practising in Lahore.

THE abduction, rape and murder of little Zainab has not only robbed one family of a child but has also ravaged this country. She was not the first child we failed to protect.

Child abuse, particularly sexual violence, is one of the most pressing social issues facing our nation. Such crimes are tragic reminders of the failure of the state, and call for a complete overhaul of our intent towards child protection.

The majority of the child abuse cases in Pakistan are registered under the Zina Ordinance, 1979, which prohibits all forms of illegal sexual intercourse including rape. The Punjab Suppression of Prostitution Ordinance, 1961, the Sindh Children Act, 1955, and the Punjab Children Ordinance, 1983, all cover some forms of child abuse.

Read: Is it fair to blame Kasur police alone for failure to track down culprits behind incidents of rape, murder?

In 1990, Pakistan ratified the UN Conven­tion on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), committing itself to implement the convention’s provisions through harmonised policies, legislation and plans of action, and to report progress to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child every five years.

After revelations of a child pornography ring in Kasur in 2015, 20 people were arrested in connection with the criminal scandal. At the time, only rape and sodomy were punishable under the law. As a result, several new provisions were added to our legislature to strengthen our child protection framework.

Let little Zainab be the last child we fail as a state.

The first amendment to the Pakistan Penal Code in relation to child abuse in 2016 criminalised sexual assault against minors, child pornography and trafficking. Sexual assault is now punishable by up to seven years in prison (previously, only rape was criminalised), and child pornography (previously not included in the law) is punishable by seven years in prison and a fine of Rs700,000.

Prosecution for rape has also benefited from recent amendments. Sections 164(A) and 164(B), inserted into the Code of Criminal Procedure in 2016, enable authorities to obtain and use DNA evidence. Section 161(A) also guarantees a rape victim the right to legal representation.

Despite a complex framework, the legislative tools we have at our disposal have not been utilised effectively, and have thus far failed to deter perpetrators of violence against children. While further specialised legislation is needed, as the situation stands, our biggest failure in protecting our children is not lack of legislation but lack of its enforcement.

The depravity that leads to such crimes occurring, especially considering the circumstances of Zainab’s case, calls for further action. The preamble to the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, introduces the act “to provide for the prevention of terrorism, sectarian violence and for speedy trial of heinous offences”. Based on these goals, it is high time that rape and sexual violence against children were added to Section 6 of the ATA so that it may be prosecuted with the same vigilance given to perpetrators of acts of terror.

The DNA profile of all citizens should be included in the Nadra database.

It is also necessary to properly train judicial officials and law-enforcement agencies. According to Human Rights Watch, “Even a well-drafted law is unlikely to achieve its objectives in the absence of a trained and accountable police force, adequately staffed probation departments, judges that are familiar with the applicable domestic law and international standards, and facilities that are designed for the guidance and care of juvenile offenders.”

The juvenile justice system also requires attention.

The age defining a child should be brought up in accordance to what is prescribed internationally. Secondly, there should be equal treatment for children regardless of gender — as for zina crimes, female victims should no longer be punished for an abuse inflicted upon them. Thirdly, there should be stricter punishment against perpetrators of sexual violence against children. And, as per Article 39 of the UNCRC, the government should take all necessary measures to promote the psychological and physical recovery of child victims. Currently, rehabilitative measures are underdeveloped, if not non-existent. There is an urgent need to establish such facilities throughout the country.

There must be an overhaul of the system at every level so that the authorities are not only successful in recovering children, but also in catching and punishing culprits. The crimes against Zainab reflect the absolute failure of the police, expose the lack of foresight in our legislature, and have resulted in the public losing all faith in this government.

If we wait much longer to effect concrete change, we will also lose faith in ourselves. The fate of young Zainab, loving daughter, thoughtful sister, cherished granddaughter, passionate student — human being — should be etched in our collective conscience. Let her be the last child we fail as a state.

Usually women, who bear the brunt of pregnancy and childbirth, have the least say in the decision making process but do want at least to have a choice in the matter.

The Population Council of Pakistan (PCP) data shows that more than 50 per cent of married women do not want a second child. Between 1990-91 and 2006-07, the proportion of women who wanted to limit their family size increased from 40 per cent to 52 per cent, and those in urban areas preferred smaller families.

But Pakistan’s legal system does not give women the control over what is such an important decision. The Section 338 of the PPC says, before the foetus organs are formed, the offence is penalised by imprisonment for 3–10 years. After organs are formed, compensation (diyat) is imposed. Imprisonment may also be imposed.

Abortion is only permissible for saving the life of the mother or providing her ‘necessary treatment’ (until the organs of the child have formed, following which only the life exception applies).

Whether it is a pre-marital teenage pregnancy, with the young girl at the mercy of social stigma, or it is a rape survivor who has been unfortunately impregnated – the choice to lose the foetus during the early weeks is not allowed, unless situation is dire. In many cases as a result girls have even taken the last resort as was the case of one 16-year-old Marium in 2001, who had a choice between giving birth to a baby and face ostracism, or to kill herself. She chose the latter.

But while the law does not allow abortions so easily, during a study the PCP discovered that about 890,000 abortions are taking place nationally. These are only the reported cases. More than half are being performed by quacks. The study shows that 696,000 women with post-abortion complications visit health facilities annually for post abortion care.

On the other hand the Millennium Development Goal 5 calls for a 75 per cent reduction in maternal mortality and universal access to reproductive health by 2015. But in Pakistan, this MDG along with several others, seem to remain as unresolved as ever.

Another study in January 2012 showed that proportion of total abortions carried out by untrained personnel had risen from 44 per cent to 49 per cent between 1995 and 2008. This paradoxical link between illegalisation and an increase in abortions is explained by the fact that those countries that have restrictive abortion laws tend to invest little in family planning and reproductive health measures. This results in higher unwanted pregnancies and resultantly more surreptitious abortions.

The 2012 overall rate of women treated for abortion-related health complications in both the private and public sectors is only 15 in 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 49. The lowest rate is in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and not because of contraception, but because of forced pregnancy terms. Also with the increase in population, the health sector is overburdened and treatment rate decreased from 7 to 6 per 1,000 women of reproductive age.

Those working within reproductive health sectors have been shouting themselves hoarse about giving more leeway to the woman who must make a decision about whether she can bear the child or not. This is an important decision.

However, moral values established in Pakistan’s patriarchal system have led the general population to believe that if abortions are allowed, there will tend to be more irresponsible pregnancies. This is completely untrue.

First of all the majority of women seeking such services are married, above 30 years and are usually uneducated and residents of rural areas with five children or more.

Dr Anila Warsi, who is a reproductive health expert, says the entire problem lies in the lack of family planning. “Because of this, there are unwanted pregnancies and dangerous terminations, which is acting as a burden on the public health system,” she says. “But where campaigning is concerned, the future seems bleak.

“People must understand the basic problem is not abortion, although I myself do not condone irresponsible pregnancies. But if they are so scared of even sex education how can they begin to think of abortion as a choice?”","['Xari Jalil', 'Hakim Abdul Bari', 'A Sheikh', 'Syeda Sara Batool', 'Haroon Rooha', 'Images Staff', 'Khurram Husain', 'F.S.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1398648,3/31/18 10:28,"Pakistan, India agree to end envoys harassment","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and India on Friday agreed to address complaints of harassment of diplomats in accordance with the bilaterally agreed 1992 ‘Code of Conduct’ on treatment of diplomatic and consular staff in each other’s country.

The agreement was announced through a statement simultaneously issued by the Foreign Office and the Indian Ministry of External Affairs.

The statement reads: “India and Pakistan have mutually agreed to resolve matters related to the treatment of diplomats and diplomatic premises, in line with the 1992 ‘Code of Conduct’ for treatment of diplomatic/consular personnel in India and Pakistan.”

The discussions between the two countries had begun after Pakistan recalled its High Commissioner Sohail Mahmood for consultations following a spike in incidents of harassment of Pakistani diplomats in Delhi. India, meanwhile, too had been complaining about the treatment of its diplomats in Islamabad.

It is said that over 50 incidents of harassment of Pakistani diplomats and their families took place between March 7 and 23. It turned ugly when the children of Pakistani diplomats while on way to their schools were stopped and harassed.

Both countries will adhere to 1992 Code of Conduct on treatment of diplomatic staff

India, meanwhile, claims to have sent 15 note verbales to the Foreign Office to protest over alleged maltreatment of their diplomats in Pakistan.

The harassment of Pak­istani diplomats had incre­ased after security agencies in Islamabad insisted that the employees of a private contractor working on Indian High Commission’s residential complex get security clearance. This requirement was misread in Delhi as coercive and agencies there started harassing Pakistani diplomats.

The discussions on addressing each other’s complaints had significantly progressed when High Commissioner Mahmood last week returned to New Delhi. His visit to Ajmer Sharif for attending the Urs of Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti became possible because of the flexibility shown by the host after behind-the-scenes talks.

Similarly, in Islamabad, Indian diplomats after a long break attended the March 23 Joint Services Parade.

After Mr Mahmood’s return to Delhi, the foreign secretaries of Pakistan and India met the high commissioners of the other side in their capitals and reached this agreement. The agreement, multiple sources confirmed, had been finalised a couple of days before its formal announcement when Indian High Commissioner Ajay Bisaria met Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua. Bisaria is currently visiting Lahore.

High Commissioner Mahmood had met Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale in Delhi.

Code of conduct

The 1992 Code of Conduct was signed by then foreign secretary Shaharyar Khan and his Indian counterpart J.N. Dixit for “smooth and unhindered functioning” of each other’s diplomatic missions and consular staff and to ensure that the privileges and immunities of the diplomatic and consular staff and premises were not violated.

The 12-point code of conduct provides for guaranteeing dignity and personal inviolability of diplomatic and consular personnel posted in each other’s country; avoidance of intrusive and aggressive surveillance, harassment, threatening, tailing of cars and trespassing on residences; safety and security of the diplomatic and consular staff and their families and unhindered working of the local domestic staff engaged by diplomats at their residences; no harassment and questioning of visitors; inviolability of official and private vehicles of the diplomatic and consular staff; respect for religious, social and cultural sensitivities of the host state; and the strength of missions and the procedure for issuance of visas to diplomatic and consular staff.

The code of conduct describes the process for dealing with complaints and cases of breach of diplomatic protocols by the diplomats and consular staff. It also envisages facilitation for media personnel.

SIX years after Hafiz Saeed Rehman went missing from Sariab Road Quetta, the police dug up a grave to look for him. The High Court ordered that a body be exhumed because Quetta police, after giving half a dozen other explanations for his disappearance, had started saying that Hafiz Saeed had been killed. His father Allah Bakhsh Bangulzai who has been campaigning for his son’s release for nine years, didn’t believe the police. “I knew it wasn’t his grave, I knew my son wasn’t dead,” insists Allah Bakhsh, who runs a small grocery store near his house. Allah Baksh Bangulzai’s faith wasn’t just the faith of a father who can’t bring himself to believe that his eldest son might be dead. He had seen with his own eyes the body that was buried in that grave. Nine year earlier looking for his newly disappeared son Allah Baksh had done the rounds of the mortuaries. “They showed me two bodies,” says Allah Baksh. He had a really good look. “They were both my son’s age. One boy had his throat slit. Another one had his legs cut off just below his knees. I was relieved neither of them was my son.”

Hafiz Saeed became one of almost 1300 disappeared Baloch citizens whose families have been holding almost a perpetual vigil for their release. They travel from distant villages and towns to hold three-month-long protest camps outside Islamabad and Karachi Press Club but our press usually ignores them. When Voice of Missing Baloch Persons recently held a rally to mark one thousand days of their protest, no TV channels covered it.

After his visit to the local morgue, Allah Baksh was convinced that his son was alive. For next six years Allah Baksh’s son kept making fleeting appearances in various reports, official documents and court hearings. Once it was admitted in Balochistan High Court that he was in the custody of our intelligence organisations. Once he was told that his son had been sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment because he was a terrorist. Then the high court was told that he was doing his time in Gujranwala jail. But after six years of running up down the country and knocking at every one’s door Allah Baksh stood besides a grave waiting for a body to be exhumed, certain in his heart that it wouldn’t be his son.

Hafiz Saeed left his home on the evening of July 4, 2003. It was a Friday and there had been a huge bomb blast in the area. Forty people died in that blast and soon after a curfew was imposed. “He came home after his maghreb prayers, got on his bicycle and left,” remembers Allah Baksh. He repeats the same details over and over again as if he has missed something and if he can remember the exact sequence of events, he’ll find out where his son is right now. “There was a curfew in our part of the city, the curfew started at 6pm and Hafiz left home at 6.15.” Six years of searching his memory and he still has no answer why his son left home just after the curfew came into effect. “May be he thought if you are on a bicycle nobody will bother you. May be he didn’t know that a curfew has been imposed. I don’t know what he was thinking.”

Hafiz Saeed was 25 when he disappeared. He was an obedient and bright son. He had done his Hifz-i-Quran by the age of 15. He went on to do his matric privately. He was teaching other children Hifz-i-Quran at Iqra School. He was the eldest in the family and was engaged to be married a year after he disappeared.

With his madressha background, his teaching job, his beard and his shalwar above his ankle, a lot of people, specially the security forces, tend to jump to the conclusion that Hafiz must have been somehow involved with some religious cult, some jihadi organisation. “He never did any of those things. After finishing his teaching work at school, he came straight to my shop in Gharib Abad and helped me out. He had cousins who were also madressah teachers. Sometimes they visited. I never heard anything political. He was very pious, yes, but he was a straight boy. He was the eldest of my children, he was close to me. I would have known.”

Hafiz Saeed didn’t return home that night. “My son had never not spent a night at home. I got worried. I started looking.”

Hafiz Saeed and his family had no personal enmity. His father assumed that Saeed had been picked up by the law-enforcing agencies for violating the curfew. He thought about kidnapping for ransom but told himself that who would expect a ransom from someone as poor as him. He registered an FIR, did the rounds of the hospitals and asked everyone he could.

“Fifteen days later a man came looking for me,” says Allah Baksh. “He came on a motorbike, introduced himelf as Yasin from MI.” Yasin from MI asked Allah Baksh if his son Hafiz Saeed was involved with any Jihadi organisation. “I told him that he wasn’t involved with anyone or anything except his teaching and my shop.” The man on the motorbike assured Allah Baksh that MI will investigate and if he was with any of the law-enforcing agencies, he’ll be released.” For next three months Allah Baksh kept looking but didn’t hear anything from anywhere. He filed a petition in the high court. The petition has been going on for eight years, now, but not once has he seen a glimpse of his son despite various orders by the court saying that a meeting should be arranged between the missing person and his family. He has not had any kind of contact with his son during this time.

In the intial hearing a statement submitted on behalf of the ISI said that Hafiz Saeed had been arrested after he was injured in the bomb blast and he was being interrogated. Crime Branch also confirmed in a separate report that Hafiz Saeed was in the custody of ‘sensitive agencies’. The high court instructed that a meeting be arranged with the family. The meeting never happened. Instead Crime Branch submitted another report, this time saying that Hafiz Saeed wasn’t in the custody of ‘sensitive agencies’.

Allah Baksh wrote letters to President, to Chief Justice but never heard back. For 11 months he sat in a protest camp outside Quetta Press Club. For all these years there was no sighting, no news of his son but he didn’t give up.

Then out of the blue a list surfaced in Quetta High Court in 2009. There were 13 missing people on it. They were all supposed to be serving time in jails. Hafiz Saeed was on it. According to the list he had been court martialled and sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment. The report said that he was in Gujranwala jail.

Allah Baksh managed to contact HRCP who sent one of its people to Gujranwala jail. The jail authorities said they didn’t have Hafiz Saeed. Allah Bakhsh went back to the high court and this time police filed a submission that Hafiz Saeed had actually been killed in that blast and buried.

By now Hafiz Saeed had been suspected of being involved in the blast, suspected of being injured in the blast, and now six years later his family was being told that Hafiz Saeed had actually died in the blast. Allah Baksh reminded the court that his son had left home four hours after the blast happened. High court ordered a DNA test. Police were basically saying that one of the bodies that they had shown Allah Baksh six years ago was his son’s. “I had had a good look at those bodies,” Allah Baksh again gives a graphic description of the slit throat and decapitated legs. “That wasn’t my son.”

Before they exhumed the body that wasn’t his son’s, they gave him some clothes and asked if he recognised them. “These clothes didn’t belong to my son. After he became a Hafiz-i-Quran he never wore a shirt with buttons. But just to make sure I took these clothes to show his mother. And she also said that these were not his clothes.”

The body was exhumed and as Allah Baksh had predicted it wasn’t his son. He was relieved. But not for long. He says that secretly he envies people who have found the bodies of their loved-ones. “They have buried them and now they mourn them,” he says. “All I can do is wait.”

And while he waits, Allah Baksh can’t stop thinking of the events of that fateful evening. “What I don’t understand is that he came home after offering his maghrib prayers. There had already been a bomb blast. Then he took his bicycle and went out. There was curfew outside. I don’t know why he went out.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1341457,6/24/17 7:12,Police told to add honour killing sections to attempted murder case,"ISLAMABAD: The National Commission on Human Rights (NCHR) has directed the capital police to incorporate honour killing sections in an FIR registered against a man for opening fire on his teenage cousin in the Nilore village in order to prevent the chance of pardon or settlement within the family.

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) on June 14 drew attention of the NCHR towards the attempted honour killing.

A letter sent by the HRCP to the NCHR stated that on June 9 a girl, aged between 16 and 17, was shot thrice allegedly by her cousin in the Nilore village.

It said seven months ago the father of the girl, who belonged to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and was settled in Nilore, decided to marry her off to a man much older than her.

However, the girl left her home with a boy belonging to a local community.

Four days later, the couple was caught at Khanna Pul and brought back home.

The girl was beaten and locked up inside the home. On June 9, the letter claimed, the girl’s cousin shot her and fled.

National Commission on Human Rights (NCHR) issues direction to prevent chances of pardon or settlement within family

Her father filed an FIR with the Nilore police the same day but the accused could not be arrested.

The victim is under treatment at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims).

On June 15, she was operated upon and a bullet which had pierced into her throat was removed successfully. She has now started communicating with her family through writing and also recorded her statement with the police.

On Thursday, NCHR Chairman retired Justice Ali Nawaz Chowhan along with members from Islamabad, KP and Balochistan heard the case at its head office. Police officers and doctors from Pims briefed the commission about the case.

Pims medico-legal officer Dr Naseema said when the victim was brought to the hospital she was in a very critical condition but now she was a bit stable and her condition improving.

Justice Chowhan said honour killing was totally against human rights and freedom and liberty of a person and such acts should be condemned by the public at large and there should be strict punishments for the offenders.

He directed the police to add the specific sections of the law relating to honour killing to the FIR to prevent the chances of pardon or settlement within the family.

The police assured the meeting that the sections would be added and added that efforts were being made to arrest the suspect.

Raja Qaiser Ghaffar, the chairman of Union Council 7 (Pind Begwal), told Dawn that three bullets were shot at the girl: one entered her throat, the second hit her chest and the third pierced her ribs.

“It seemed a pre-planned attempt of murder because after the incident efforts were made to hush up the incident. On the other hand, police were also not pressed to arrest the suspect,” he said.

On the other hand, he added, the girl in her written statement claimed that her cousin tried to kill her and she did not want to forgive him, he said.

“I am against underage marriages. The girl was only 16 and was being married to a man as old as her father. I believe that no girl should be married against her will. Moreover, girls less than 18 years of age should not be allowed to get married,” he said.

“In the rural areas around Islamabad, honour killings or attempted honour killings are not infrequent. Something needs to be done about this.

“Whenever such an incident takes place, the state should intervene and the victim should be placed under the state guardianship. This is the only way to prevent inter-family and inter-community compromises in which the victim is simply disregarded,” Mr Ghaffar said.

Inayatullah, an official of the Nilore police, told Dawn that though the incident had taken place in the heat of the moment police had decided to take strict action against the suspect.

“The father of the suspect was called to the police station on Thursday and he promised to produce the suspect after Eidul Fitr. However, it is a family issue and sooner or later it will be settled,” he said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1452696,12/21/18 7:03,Art exhibition highlights various aspects of gender-based violence,"— White Star

ISLAMABAD: The works of 10 young artists highlighting various aspects of gender-based violence were exhibited on Thursday in a show titled Silence Allows Violence – Breaking Silence through Art.

The exhibition was held at the Pakistan National Council of Arts as part of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, and inaugurated by Shirakat – Partnership for Development and MenEngage Alliance Pakistan.

Shirakat Executive Director Bilquis Tahira introduced the organisation and its role as the secretariat of the MenEngage Alliance. She said: “Shirakat uses creative approaches to change the attitudes and behaviours that lead to gender-based violence and inequities. We have found that arts, culture and sports are very strong mediums to change the mindsets that reduce the risk of gender violence.”

The exhibiting artists used various mediums to depict their perception of women’s strength, role and potential while others highlighted the restrictions and repressive practices that have found space in society.

Sadia Atif said that all the artists were “breaking the silence through our art to stop violence and to stop the silence around violence”.

She added: ‘My theme is to highlight and stop sex selective abortion where the girl child is terminated as boys are preferred. If there is no girl, there is no woman, no society, and eventually no boy.”

Another exhibiting artist, Numaira Javed, said she tried to show the importance of women in society.

“I believe there is a whole world inside a woman and she should carry on as she wants without being affected by society. Her thoughts are like butterflies that add beauty on earth and this beauty can only be effective if her thoughts are free and her creativity is not restricted,” she went on.

“I think it is time we should stop talking about violence against a specific gender, I think we should talk about violence against humanity. Art is a celebration of life, and if we are creating something we should be sensitive enough to understand that the most important things that we need are love, peace, tolerance and diversity,” artist Raza Shah said.

Jean-Francois Cautain, ambassador of the European Union, said at the exhibition: “For me, gender based violence, especially violence against women, is the darkest side of patriarchy. This is not specific to Pakistan but Pakistan also has a way to go before achieving gender equality and we are working on that with our partners.”

“In any country artists are visionaries. They are the people who are looking beyond the limits of society; they are trying to break the barriers and boundaries. Congratulations to the artists on what they have created, I am very impressed by what I have seen. I hope that people come to see the exhibition and men and women are inspired and engaged by it,” he said.

Canadian High Commissioner Wendy Gilmour said: “Violence against women and girls is a problem that affects all of our societies, not just Pakistan, not just South Asia. Activities like the 16 Days of Activism and this art exhibition remind us there is so much that we have to do on these subjects.

“One in three women and girls experience violence over the course of their lifetimes so we have to work with our boys and men while they are young so they realize the role they have to play to stop gender-based violence. It is only through women’s participation in public life, in political life, in industry, in all spheres, in the army, in the police, that we will ensure that there is space for women and safety for women in our societies.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1367292,10/31/17 2:37,Harassing women,"The writer is an author.

The incident of the Karachi-based Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) doctor who was reportedly fired/suspended after sending filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy’s sister a Facebook friend request has ignited our very own mini Harvey Weinstein scandal.

Ever since Chinoy tweeted about the incident on Oct 23, people have been debating whether the doctor should have faced such action, whether Chinoy abused her star power in order to protect her sister, and whether what he did genuinely constitutes sexual harassment.

Let’s clear up a few misconceptions, especially about what sexual harassment is. We have a horror of even thinking about the subject, and prefer to suppress it rather than confront it. This is a global reflex, but now it’s time to overcome it and think hard about what we’re doing to women every day in our own country.

Sexual harassment isn’t just vulgar comments to a woman walking by on the street, or the sleazy man at work forcing himself onto his colleagues or subordinates. It is also unwanted personal attention in everyday situations.

According to the University of Michigan Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Centre, harassment can be “Letters, telephone calls, visits, pressure for sexual favours, pressure for unnecessary personal interaction and pressure for dates where a sexual/romantic intent appears evident but remains unwanted”.

People may claim that a Facebook friend request is an innocent attempt at social connection, but an emergency room doctor has no business sending a Facebook friend request to a woman he’s treated in the ER.

Not only does this violate medical ethics and codes of conduct, but it violates the patient’s personal information and goes against the recommendations of many medical boards on social media and doctors. The British Medical Association, for example, states very clearly that doctors should not be Facebook friends with their patients.

It’s part of the system to doubt women.

Strangely, while discussing this on Twitter and Facebook with friends and colleagues, I encountered dozens of men and women defending the doctor, insisting that what he did was not harassment, and that Chinoy was defaming the country by having spoken out about the doctor’s misconduct.

Even after it emerged that he was under warning from the administration for previous episodes of misconduct, and that AKUH had come to its own decision about firing/suspending him, these men and women continued to defend the doctor and slur Chinoy and her family.

But this kind of defensive behaviour is no surprise to anyone who studies gender interactions and is familiar with the issue of sexual harassment. People may claim to be very confused about what sexual harassment is, but the issue goes beyond simple ignorance.

It’s simply a part of the entire system to doubt the woman who says she feels harassed, pick apart her accusation and label it ‘not really harassment’, and defend the predator as ‘a nice guy’ or a victim of a witch hunt.

Sexual harassment can be blatant or subtle, but the result is that it creates a hostile environment for women, in which they become psychologically affected and unable to do their job. In the case of a patient, the doctor’s office or emergency room transforms from a safe space in which she entrusts her life to the doctor’s care into yet another minefield where she has to defend herself against unwanted attention — the doctor holds power over the patient, no matter what their classes outside the emergency room.

Not only is initiating an unwanted Facebook friend request highly inappropriate for a doctor, it can provoke feelings of stress, trauma, and anxiety in a patient who has just been through a medical emergency.

A Facebook friend request may seem trivial, and this is one of the main arguments men and women defending the doctor have been putting about: it was just a friend request, it was harmless, just block it, ignore it, move on.

But as women we get hundreds of these a day and have to waste our time and energy rejecting them, changing our privacy settings, and protecting ourselves online in a way men never have to even think about. Instead of minimising the constant harassment of these messages, why not listen to women for a change tell you how annoying, intrusive, and stress-inducing this unwanted attention really feels, without suggesting that she should just get off social media if she can’t deal with it?

Finally, you should examine your motives when defending the actions and intentions of an alleged repeat offender.

The tech website Tech Crunch spoke to a woman CEO, Joelle Emerson about this phenomenon. She said: “People who defend harassing behaviour do so because they have engaged in such behaviour themselves. Or they defend individuals accused of this behaviour because they believe them to be generally ‘good people’. Or, as a rule, they just don’t believe women.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/716076/forced-marriage-threat-made-to-ngo-women-2,5/5/12 23:15,Forced marriage threat made to NGO women,"MANSEHRA, May 5: Former Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal MNA from Kohistan Maulvi Abdul Haleem on Saturday warned women working in nongovernmental organisations against entering his district and said violators of the warning would be forcibly married off to locals.

“I issued a decree during Friday sermon that getting education for degrees by women is repugnant to Islamic injunctions because if a woman gets degree, she may use it for job, an act which Islam doesn’t allow in absence of mehram (close relatives),” he told reporters here.

Mr Haleem said: “If women working in NGOs enter Kohistan, we won’t spare them and solemnise their nikkah (marriage) with local men.”

Maulana Haleem, who remained MNA during the Musharraf regime, said if a woman got education and used it for job, then it was against the teachings of Islam.

“That’s why girls are not going to schools in Kohistan and girl schools are used as cattle pen,” he said.

The ex-MNA, who was once a mufti at Darul Uloom Haqqania, Akora Khattak, and also taught top clerics Maulana Samiul Haq, Maulana Anwarul Haq, Maulana Nizamuddin Shamazai, said he was not opposed to NGOs and would ensure complete protection of their male staffers in Kohistan.

He said if NGOs wanted to work for women’s development, they should spend money for the purpose through government departments.

“We won’t let them (NGOs) influence our women in the name of empowerment and financial support through women workers of NGOs,” said the ex-MNA, who remained the district chairman in Kohistan during the General Ziaul Haq regime.

He said he issued a decree in the past in favour of poppy cultivation and trade and continued to believe so.

“I also rose up against the unjustified slaughtering of animals by Jehanzeb Khan, the ruler of the formerly Swat state, at his birthday. Kohistan was part of the state of Swat at that time. Even he (ruler) put me behind the bars but I didn’t withdraw the decree,” he said.

The ex-MNA said killing of women in the name of honour was a ‘local custom and religious practice’ in Kohistan.

He said if someone witnessed female members of his family roaming with ghair mehram (other than close relatives), he could kill her without producing four witnesses,” he said.

Meanwhile, a man was killed and his father and two brothers critically wounded on Saturday when their rival tribesmen attacked their house in Palis area.

A dispute over the ownership of a water reservoir was blamed for the Narng Shahkhail attack on Badakhail tribesmen.

The dead included Azizur Rehman, while the injured were his father, Mohammad Asghar, and his brothers, Mohammad Essa and Abdul Quddos, whose condition was stated be critical at a local hospital.

The Palis police lodged an FIR and began investigation.

Last year, four people were killed and three injured when Badakhail and Narng Shah-khail tribes exchanged heavy fire over the same dispute.","[""The Newspaper'S Correspondent"", 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

The bill will go before a parliamentary committee as early as Thursday, said Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who is an increasingly influential member of her father's ruling party.

The government has faced mounting pressure to pass the law against murders carried out by people professing to be acting in defence of the honour of their family.

The law would remove a loophole that allows other family members to pardon a killer.

The brother of social media star Qandeel Baloch has been arrested in connection with her strangling death and told a news conference he was incensed by her often risque posts on social media.

Some 500 women are killed each year in Pakistan at the hands of family members over perceived damage to “honour” that can involve eloping, fraternising with men or any other infraction against conservative values that govern women's modesty.

Maryam Nawaz said the government wanted to pass the law unanimously and had been negotiating with religious parties in parliament.

“We have finalised the draft law in the light of negotiations,” she told Reuters in an interview.

“The final draft will be presented to a committee of joint session of parliament on July 21 for consideration and approval.”

Maryam said once the parliamentary committee approved the bill, it would be presented for a vote in a “couple of weeks” before a joint session of parliament.

A spokesman for Jamaat-i-Islami, one of the two major religious parties in parliament, said his party would not oppose the bill.

The country’s other main religious political party, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, could not be reached for comment but it has only a small number of seats in parliament.

Both religious parties have traditionally opposed legislation empowering women.

The upper house of parliament passed the bill in 2015 but it lapsed after the government failed to put it up for a vote in the lower house because it was preoccupied with legislation aimed at tackling security problems and economic reforms.

A senior government official told Reuters all major parties were now backing the bill and it was likely to be passed in a few weeks by a joint session of parliament.

“The prime minister is taking personal interest,” added a second official and close aide to Sharif.

“You will see in coming days more will be done, big changes will be announced.”

In a rare move, this week the government became a complainant in the police case against Qandeel's brother accused of her murder, designating it a crime against the state and thereby blocking her family from forgiving their son.

Right to forgive

Qandeel had long divided opinion with her social media photos and posts.

She was unapologetic about pushing the boundaries of acceptability for women and changing “the typical orthodox mindset” of her audience.

Many viewed her as a disgrace to cultural values while others hailed her as a “feminist icon”.

She ran into political controversy last month after her “selfie” photographs with Mufti Qavi went viral, leading to him being fired from the Ruet-i-Hilal committee.

After her death, Mutfi Qavi told media that her murder should serve as an example for others who tried to malign the clergy.

Qavi is being investigated for her murder along with Qandeel's two brothers.

Although government officials appeared confident of backing for the bill in parliament, it could still face resistance.

The influential Council of Islamic Ideology, which advises the government on the compatibility of laws with Islam, warned that it would not support any law that removed the forgiveness loophole, even though the council considers honour killings a crime.

“Islamic law and the Quran say that the right to forgive or punish lies first and foremost with the victim's family,” said council spokesman Inam Ullah.

“So if this bill is trying to completely take away that right from the family, then of course that is against Islamic teachings. The state cannot completely take away that right from the family.”

The religious parties and the council hold significant influence over public opinion and the government fears a backlash if any law passes without their approval.

“This mentality — that you can get away with murder in the name of honour — it has to be done away with,” said Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, whose documentary on honour killings “A Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness” won an Oscar this year.

The seminar ‘16 days of activism against gender-based violence’ was organised the other day by the US Consulate Alumni Network Pakistan at the Shangla campus of the University of Swat.

Abdul Wasi, the organiser, said the seminar was part of a campaign launched by the US against gender-based violence throughout the world to record a protest against the menace.

Islamia, a female student from English department, urged the government to ensure equal opportunities to both the genders in getting higher education.

Huzaifa, another student, said the violence against women was because of lack of literacy. He said he could play a role to educate the rural people of Shangla that they should wage struggle for stopping violence against women.

Dr Tahir Ali, the campus coordinator, called for avoiding harassment of women at workplace and according respect to them.

Guest speaker Saqib Iqbal urged the students to play their due role in creating awareness among the public against gender-based violence.

At the end, awards were given to the students for their performances.

POWER OUTAGES: Residents of Alpuri tehsil have resented the excessive power loadshedding.

Residents of Alpuri, Lilonai, Kotkay, Koz Alpuri, Mota Khan and other areas told reporters on Saturday that they had been facing prolonged power outages for a month now.

They lamented that the provincial government had banned sale of firewood for domestic use. The locals demanded of the Pesco chief to rationalise the duration of loadshedding as they paid the bills on time.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1409636,5/24/18 6:55,Forced marriages,"CONTROLLING women’s sexuality to uphold antediluvian notions of family honour is a common motivation for forced marriages that end in violence, rape and even murder.

On Wednesday in a landmark judgement, a British court found a mother guilty of deceiving her teenage daughter into travelling to Pakistan and forcing her to marry a much older man.

Even more horrific was that the man in question was the same maternal relative who had raped her on a previous visit to Pakistan.

Only aged 13 at the time, she had to undergo an abortion to terminate the resultant pregnancy.

The verdict finally sends a strong message that victims’ voices will be heard and that there are consequences for those who coerce them into marriage.

Despite a 2014 law criminalising forced marriages in the UK (even those conducted abroad involving British nationals), few cases are reported.

This is attributed to complex, patriarchal family structures that traverse countries, and make it difficult to seek help if the upshot is that parents could go to jail.

Because many girls from diaspora communities are taken abroad during school vacations to get married, teachers and even airport staff are instructed to watch out for signs of distress.

The fear is real.

Refusal to obey parents in such matters can attract the ultimate retribution.

The recent murder of Sana Cheema, an Italian-Pakistani tricked by her family into travelling to Pakistan to be married, is a case in point.

According to the UK’s Forced Marriage Unit, Pakistan, with 439 cases, ranked the highest among the top four ‘focus’ countries in 2017, followed by Bangladesh, Somalia and India.

The adherence to such oppressive practices is linked partly with the high prevalence of arranged marriages among second and third generation Asian immigrants with spouses from their country of origin.

This trend has encouraged ghettoisation and impeded integration for decades.

Coupled with poor employment prospects, a lack of language skills and education among immigrants — especially among Pakistanis and Bangladeshis who come to the UK through such arranged marriages — the result is further socioeconomic isolation from the mainstream.

Clearly, instituting strategies to foster multiculturalism is essential but the British government must do more to address the underlying reasons that perpetuate imported misogynistic practices.

A forced marriage is not a cultural matter but a criminal offence that must be investigated, even if collaboration from other governments is necessary, so that those at risk are protected.

A forced marriage is not a cultural matter but a criminal offence that must be investigated, even if collaboration from other governments is necessary, so that those at risk are protected.","['british', 'uk', 'pakistan', 'parents', 'married', 'forced', 'marriage', 'marriages', 'travelling', 'family']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/03/58c174558cfc1.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2018/05/5b0522c3f1f6b.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2017/03/58c174558cfc1.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd329902b790.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/2012/06/forced_marriages_116.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2018/05/5b0522c3f1f6b.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg', 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}",TRUE,http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Refusal to obey parents in such matters can attract the ultimate retribution.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1409636', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Forced marriages', 'description': 'Refusal to obey parents in such matters can attract the ultimate retribution.', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1409636', 'title': 'Forced marriages', 'description': 'Refusal to obey parents in such matters can attract the ultimate retribution.', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2018-05-24 06:55:31', 'modified_time': '2018-05-24 07:21:59', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/2677/editorial'}, 'author': 'Editorial'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1243924,3/6/16 17:11,Woman burnt alive in India 'honour killing',"JAIPUR: A woman was burnt to death by her brothers for marrying a man belonging to a different caste, police said Sunday, in the latest incident of a so-called honour killing in India.

Rama Kunwar, 30, had eloped with her lover eight years ago and returned to her village in western Rajasthan state on Friday, hoping her family had forgiven her for marrying against their wishes.

But her still enraged brothers barged in as she was visiting her in-laws' house and dragged her outside before setting her on fire as other villagers watched.

“She thought that her parents would now accept her but as soon as her brothers came to know that she was in the village, they rushed to that house and dragged her out,” Brijran Singh, a senior administrative officer of Dungarpur district, told AFP.

“She cried for help but no one came to rescue her. They also conducted the funeral on the same night to destroy evidence,” he said.

Kunwar's mother-in-law however alerted the police who reached the spot and doused the funeral pyre in order to collect evidence.

One of Kunwar's brothers and six other men have been arrested. Authorities are still searching for an unspecified number of suspects, Singh added.

Honour killings – where couples are targeted because their families or communities disapprove of their relationships – have been carried out for centuries in India, especially in rural areas.

They are carried out by close relatives or village elders to protect what is seen as the family's reputation and pride in a hereditary-based caste system.

India's Supreme Court in 2011 ruled those involved in honour killings should face the death penalty.","['Kamal Pasha.', 'Ali', 'Ca', 'Haque Parast', 'Indian Wolfie', 'N K Ali', 'Abdulla Hussain', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman']","JAIPUR: A woman was burnt to death by her brothers for marrying a man belonging to a different caste, police said Sunday, in the latest incident of a so-called honour killing in India.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1541742,3/18/20 6:59,Rampant child abuse,"EACH year, the child protection advocacy group Sahil announces its findings on the scale of the abuse that children endure in this country; the data is collected by looking into newspaper reports on the sexual abuse of children (including rape and attempted rape), child marriage, and abducted and missing children. In its most recent statement, foraging through 84 newspapers, Sahil noted that a disturbing 2,846 cases were reported across the country in the previous year. In other words, approximately eight children were subjected to abuse each day of 2019, with more than half being girls (54pc). Prior to that, the figure was even higher at a staggering 3,832 in 2018 — the same year the body of young Zainab Ansari was found in a garbage heap in Kasur; she had been brutally raped and murdered by her captor. The incident sparked protests and demands for accountability across the country. To some degree, it also changed the way we think about the issue of sexual abuse of children, and finally led to the passage of the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Bill by the National Assembly and the Senate in recent weeks. While these figures may send a chill down the spine, they are likely only scratching the surface, as many other cases go unreported. It is only in recent years that a culture of talking about sexual abuse and exploitation has been encouraged in Pakistan, and that too only in certain sections of society. Many other stories will never see the light of day. It may even shock the more naive and insulated amongst us to learn about the exact scale of the problem, or about the capacity for evil in ‘ordinary’ people.

Children are one of the most vulnerable groups in any society, lacking the vocabulary, clear understanding, and often the support they need to confront their abusers. From a young age, they are taught not to question authority — the adults in their midst — and often suffer alone, suppressing whatever horrors they are made to endure in silence. Many abusers are from within the family, or close to the family members, earning and abusing their trust. In Sahil’s most recent data, the majority of children that were subjected to abuse were between the ages of six and 15, but there were some even under the age of one. Let the horror of that figure sink in.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1574682/second-death-in-two-weeks-polio-claims-14-year-old-boys-life,8/16/20 7:50,Second death in two weeks: Polio claims 14-year-old boy’s life,"LAHORE: A second polio-related death was reported in the city within two weeks after a 14-year-old boy died of the crippling disease at Mayo Hospital.

Talha of Ravi Town had died on July 27, two days after he was declared a suspected case of polio. The National Institute of Health (NIH) and the Punjab health authorities confirmed it on Saturday while officially notifying the death.

Earlier, 26-month-old Muhammad Ali had died of the disease at Children Hospital on July 14, an official privy to the information told Dawn.

This was the third death from polio in Punjab, which was also confirmed by the provincial government in a statement issued late on Saturday.

One of his immediate contacts also found infected with virus

The official said that all four limbs of Ali were paralysed and he had suffered a stroke which led to his death.

He was also a resident of Ravi Town, a health department spokesman, told Dawn.

He said Talha’s death was officially confirmed after health teams traced two minor girls, who were his immediate contacts, and found one of them infected with the same virus.

Referring to the NIH report, the spokesperson said that when Talha was shifted to the Government Said Mitha Hospital here on July 25, doctors declared him a suspected patient of poliovirus.

“The child was fine till he developed fever along with vomiting followed by gradual weakness of both the lower limbs,” the report reads.

It stated that the boy was later notified as suffering from Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) with provisional diagnosis of Guillain Barre Syndrome, the most common cause of AFP in healthy infants and children.

He was shifted to Mayo Hospital where his condition became critical due to difficulty in breathing and the weakness in upper limbs progressed, the report further stated. Talha was then shifted to the Covid-19 intensive care unit and placed on a ventilator where he died on July 27.

Meanwhile, health teams managed to trace the immediate contacts of Talha -- Noor Fatima and her younger sister from Ravi Town. The NIH report stated that Noor Fatima was fully immunised and had received the last dose of polio vaccine on March 18; the girls did not have a significant travel history. It, however, confirmed that she carried the poliovirus in her body, while the test reports of her sister were awaited.

Earlier on July 9, a six-month-old boy had succumbed to the disease in Taunsa Sharif.

Polio campaigns had remained suspended for three months due to Covid-19. However, the Punjab polio programme in-charge, Sundas Irshad, said in a statement on Saturday: “As a response, polio campaigns have been restarted to save more children from the virus. Monthly campaigns will ensure that the virus is eliminated this year.”

She urged parents to get their children vaccinated.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1475494,4/12/19 6:55,Mindset needs to be changed towards gender-based violence: minister,"ISLAMABAD: Law enforcement and the judiciary need to be sensitised and society’s mindset needs to be changed towards gender-based violence, Minister for Human Rights Dr Shireen Mazari said on Thursday.

At a seminar, she said the government is committed to ensuring an equal environment for all and to ending gender-based violence.

She said that in addition to effective implementation of existing laws, new legislation to protect the rights of every citizen – women and children in particular – from domestic violence is on the cards as well.

The minister also claimed the state of human rights in Pakistan is far better than many other countries.

Dr Mazari was speaking at an event titled ‘Striving to Protect and Uphold Equal Rights for All: A Public-Private Drive to End Gender Based Violence’ organised by the Islamabad police and Rozan.

Minister of State for Interior Shehryar Afridi was also present.

The seminar aimed to generate discourse on action required to end gender-based violence and to share steps taken by the police to deal with the issue.

Dr Mazari told participants that the government is committed to providing all possible support to survivors of violence.

“Besides implementing laws, there is a need to change the society’s mindset to end the gender based violence. Our ministry is working on creating awareness about the laws, especially for sensitization of public,” she said.

She said gender-based violence in a central issue and needs to be tackled as a priority. She added that increasing violence against marginalised groups requires a sensitised and professional police force, and praised the Islamabad police for professionalism and for their performance.

She said the police perform their duties for the public’s safety and security and urged people to respect them.

Dr Mazari said minorities are being given their own personal laws, saying that the Hindu divorce and marriage law already exists and a Christian divorce bill will be presented in parliament soon.

She added that steps are being taken for the welfare of the transgender community and to ensure the implementation of the transgender law.

A separate ward has been set up for transgender patients at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, she said, and they are receiving treatment free of charge and without any inconvenience.

She added that a domestic workers bill has already been approved by cabinet and will be presented in parliament soon.

Bilal Colony SHO Fardad Shaikh said that gas was apparently left open in the home in Sector 5-D near Dua Chowk and owing to the leakage, the home was filled with gas. The officer said that the family were asleep at around 2.30am and when the owner woke up in the morning and lit a matchstick for smoking, it triggered an explosion. As a result, the house caught fire.

Seven persons suffered burn injuries and they were taken to a hospital, where one of them, identified as Mazhar Adil, 8, died.

The SHO said that the condition of two or three other persons was also stated to be critical. He said that all the victims belonged to the same family.

The injured were identified as Fasiur Rehman Adil, 7, Syeda Ghazi Adeel, 13, Syed Adil, 35, Nosheen Adil, 30, Saba Ateeq, 25, and Saif Ullah Adil, 12.

The police called the Bomb Disposal Squad to ascertain the nature of the explosion. The bomb experts in their report stated it was an incident caused by gas leakage. The police said that it was regular gas as no evidence of a cylinder explosion was found at the spot.

BDS official Abid Farooq told the media that it appeared that the gas leakage took place at night, with gas filling the house. He said the explosion caused substantive damage to the two-storey building.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1515863,11/10/19 6:57,THE STRANGE CASE OF THE SILENT WOMEN,"In conversations surrounding the 'forced conversions' of Hindu girls, the voices of the girls are missing

‘Forced conversions’ of young girls is an emotive issue within the Hindu community of Sindh. Those accused claim that ‘young love’ is being misrepresented by the community, the media and activists. But those who know the whole truth are often not speaking...

Last year Hari Lal’s house in Daharki, a city in Ghotki district, was echoing with the sound of laughter and the cranky fights of his daughters Reena and Raveena on the eve of Diwali. Diyas illuminated the small courtyard where the sisters had drawn intricate rangoli patterns, after carefully choosing each colour. But this year, Diwali at the Lal home is devoid of colour. In March, Lal maintains, his daughters were kidnapped during the festival of Holi.

“Today our day started with crying,” Lal tells Eos. The 50-year-old cannot help but remember Reena and Raveena on every special occasion.

Lal had made headlines earlier this year when a video of him — helplessly slapping himself while crying outside the Ghotki police station, asking the police to do something to recover his daughters — went viral online. Lal was not alone. Reportedly over 2,000 Hindu men and women from nearby villages and towns had joined him in demanding justice for Reena and Raveena, blocking the highway for three consecutive days.

The incident became a flashpoint about the issue of forced conversion of Hindu girls. Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal-Bhutto Zardari met with Lal and his son Shaman Das, and assured them that all efforts would be made for the recovery of the girls. Prime Minister Imran Khan took notice of the incident. Even Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj directed the Indian high commissioner in Islamabad to send her a report about the incident.

“In the past 200 years, not a single Hindu has been converted to Islam forcibly,” Mian Mithu claims. “All those men, women, girls and boys, whether they belong to the Hindu community or any other community, come to us to change their religion out of their own choice,” he says.

But it was all for nothing. In April, the Islamabad High Court found that the sisters from Ghotki were not forcibly converted to Islam. A medical test showed that Lal’s claims that Reena and Raveena were minors were also incorrect.

Some now use the ruling as an example of how the issue of forced conversions of Hindu girls in Sindh is blown out of proportion.

But Lal refuses to accept that his daughters married the two Muslim men, Safdar Ali and Barkat Ali — both of whom were already married with kids — out of their free will. His son, Shaman Das, alleges that the strings of what happened to his sisters were being pulled by the pir of the shrine Bharchundi Sharif, Mian Abdul Haq, more commonly known as Mian Mithu.

Mian Mithu, a former PPP member of the National Assembly, is infamous for his involvement in cases of alleged forced conversions. In 2015, when Imran Khan asked Mian Mithu to join Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), the PTI chairman faced so much backlash from the Hindu community that he had to distance himself from the pir. The PPP had earlier denied Mian Mithu a ticket when he first came under the spotlight in 2012 because of accusations of forcefully converting a Hindu girl, Rinkle Kumari. The conversion, Mian Mithu had claimed, was not forced.

The religious leader found himself in the news yet again in September this year. He made headlines when he reportedly led a large number of people who took to the streets in protest to an alleged incident of blasphemy. In a rare move, Mian Mithu recently called a press conference in Karachi, clearly in an attempt to clear his name.

THE MIAN MITHU SHOW

Mian Abdul Haq alias Mian Mithu

The Karachi Press Club is bustling with energy on a Tuesday. Reporters chatter away before the man of the hour, Mian Mithu, takes his seat facing the audience. He looks calm. He is wearing his signature cone-shaped white cap and a grey kameez. His white beard and calm demeanour give the impression of someone who is very sure of himself. Joining Mian Mithu is his 30-something son, Abdul Malik, and another associate.

“I have nothing to do with the Ghotki violence. In fact, my sons and nephews tried to control the mob, which was charged over an incident of blasphemy committed by a Hindu school principal,” Mian Mithu says.

He and his followers had nothing to do with the vandalism of the Sacho Satram Das temple, he maintains. Instead, he insists, some organisations are trying to defame him.

But Mian Mithu is not just here to talk about the recent riots in Ghotki. He wants to address another accusation against him that keeps resurfacing: forced conversions of Hindu girls.

“In the past 200 years, not a single Hindu has been converted to Islam forcibly,” he claims. “All those men, women, girls and boys, whether they belong to the Hindu community or any other community, come to us to change their religion out of their own choice,” he claims. “They are not forced to convert.”

Going back to the case of Rinkle Kumari, he proudly shares that Faryal Bibi (the Muslim name of Rinkle Kumari) has recently completed reading the Quran and has returned to Pakistan after performing Umrah. She currently teaches the Quran to children at the madressah, he says.

Mian Mithu clearly wants to position himself as a saviour of love. He says that he supports newly converted Muslims, even Hindu women who are entering the religion after falling in love with a Muslim man. This is something Mian Mithu has apparently been doing for years.

According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), in 2018, more than 13 Hindu girls were abducted and married off to Muslims without the consent of their families. But members of the Hindu community say the number is higher.

Back in 2013, when he was a local member of the national assembly, he had invited the press to his residence on the outskirts of Daharki. Reporters and photographers had travelled from Karachi to see Kiran Kumari, another young woman who had supposedly fallen in love and eloped with a Muslim boy.

Kiran had narrated her and Shabbir Ahmed’s love story in great detail. She told the captivated audience of journalists that she and Ahmed had come to Mian Mithu’s residence a day before Eidul Fitr, where she embraced Islam and married the love of her life. Mian Mithu had told the media that he gives shelter to eloping couples because it is his “duty” to provide them security.

Six years later, Mian Mithu repeats the same lines at the Karachi Press Club. “There is no force in religion, but there is also no bar on helping those in need,” he declares.

“Once non-Muslim converts, the first thing that they need is shelter and a source of livelihood,” he says. “Yes, I support those who are in need, but they convert out of their own free will,” he says, at the crowded news conference at the press club.

FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD

Away from the cameras and prying journalists, 18-year-old Radha* walks on a narrow pathway passing through green fields. She is waving a small stick in her hands. She looks like any other young woman in her village in Umerkot district. Radha is wearing a colourful choli and gharara and her arms are full of white bangles. Suddenly, she stops and points to the fields where her life changed forever. “There,” she says, pointing the stick in her hand to the exact spot where she was playing when she was kidnapped by a man named Ali Nawaz, when she was 16.

“He kidnapped me from the fields in the evening and took me to some house,” she says. It was at this house that the teenage girl was raped multiple times.

Radha’s father Vinesh* petitioned the Sindh High Court against the kidnapping of his daughter. He had found out that his daughter was being kept in a village near the Sarhandi shrine, in Mirpurkhas division. Soon the court-ordered Nawaz and four of his accomplices to produce the girl in court.

The men did their best to intimidate Radha.

“They said that I have to tell the judge that I have changed my religion and married Ali Nawaz out of my own free will,” she recalls. They also warned her that they would kill her parents if she did not comply.

But, in court, Radha told the judge the truth, that Ali Nawaz had kidnapped her and had been raping her for three months. “When the judge asked who I want to live with, I said my parents,” Radha recalls the traumatic ordeal, her voice shaking as she speaks.

Members of the Hindu community in the area insist that this is not an isolated case.

According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), in 2018, more than 13 Hindu girls were abducted and married off to Muslims without the consent of their families. But members of the Hindu community say the number is higher.

Finding reliable data on the matter is difficult. Like the Reena and Raveena case, many cases that are initially reported as cases of forced conversion are later deemed love marriages. But the community refuses to buy this explanation. They believe that there is something more insidious at play here.

THE THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE

A screengrab from a viral video of Reena and Raveena saying that they have voluntarily accepted Islam

Ameet Kumar is a social rights activist and mukhiya (chief) of the local Hindu community in Daharki. “When a mother gives birth to a daughter in our community, we feel fear,” he tells us, as we sit for tea at a dhaba.

“It’s become a nightmare to live in these circumstances,” he says, adding that many Hindu families have stopped sending their daughters to school out of fear of abduction and kidnappings.

Dewan Lal, a member of the Hindu community, says these fears are not unfounded. The thin and tall man claims that every other Hindu here can narrate a similar story of abduction, conversion and forced marriage involving someone related to them. It allegedly happened with his own niece, 18-year-old Simran.

Simran, a high school student, had gone to the Mol Mata Mandir with her mother in May this year. “This is where she disappeared from,” Dewan Lal tells Eos.

“Once a girl is raped, she is blackmailed into giving whatever statement they want recorded in the court,” he says, supposedly speaking from his own experience of handling dozens of such cases. He questions why it is Hindu girls alone who are so eager to change their religion and elope. Why aren’t Hindu boys, who enjoy more social independence than the girls, doing the same?

As in the case of Reena and Raveena, the community staged protests for the recovery of Simran, this time outside the Sukkur Press Club.

Much like Reena and Raveena, a week later, Simran could also be seen in a viral video clip, saying that she had changed her religion without any coercion and had married her husband Afaq out of her own free will.

Like Reena and Raveena’s family, Simran’s uncle, Dewan Lal, claims that Mian Mithu was behind the conversion.

“After the court allowed Simran to go with her husband, Mian Mithu’s son, Mian Aslam, along with some of his men, visited the girl’s house,” he says. “They told us that Simran had married and converted her faith of her own will, and firmly asked us to let them live together now.”

Simran’s parents were apprehensive. They feared that like many girls of the area who ‘marry Muslim men out of love’, their daughter would not be allowed to leave her house, study or meet her family. When the parents expressed their concerns in the Sindh High Court, the court’s circuit bench in Sukkur passed a unique order. The two-judges directed the groom, Afaq, to ensure that Simran meets her parents and family members every three months. The judges also directed the man to allow his new bride to pursue her studies or do a job, if she chooses to.

Mian Mithu’s followers point to cases like that of Simran’s to rubbish the Hindu community’s claims that their women (and girls) are being forcefully converted. They claim that these women choose their future partners and, obviously, in order to marry a Muslim man, they have to embrace Islam.

A QUESTION OF CHOICE

Eshwar Lal Makheja meets us at a gao shalla (cowshed) in the middle of Sukkur city. He closely watches the caretakers as they prepare fodder for the 300 cows in the premises. The more well-off members of the community in the city make voluntary contributions to arrange food for the animals. Hindus, Makheja says, consider cows sacred because their Lord Krishna would cherish the butter stolen from the neighbours in his childhood. We walk and talk as Makheja takes us on a tour of the under-construction Krishna Temple on the gao shalla’s premises.

Makheja is the mukhiya of Sukkur’s Hindu community, some of whom has lived in the region since before Partition. He is also president of the Hindu Panchayat Council’s chapter for upper Sindh — where Hindus contribute significantly to the economy through businesses, trade, exports and farming.

The well-respected community member says that debunked cases of forced conversion should not be taken at face value. The most sensitive issue, Mukheja says, is rape.

“Once a girl is raped, she is blackmailed into giving whatever statement they want recorded in the court,” he says, supposedly speaking from his own experience of handling dozens of such cases.

He questions why it is Hindu girls alone who are so eager to change their religion and elope. Why aren’t Hindu boys, who enjoy more social independence than the girls, doing the same?

Makheja, who himself comes from a wealthy upper-caste Hindu family, says that the most unfortunate thing is that their community is being pushed around and cornered despite the fact that they have lived in Sindh for generations.

“These spiritual leaders’ devotees first earn the trust of Hindu girls, and then motivate them to change their religion in some cases,” he alleges. “In other instances, the devotees kidnap the girls with the support of their pirs. Since the converted girls are not allowed to meet their families, we do not know what becomes of them,” he says.

“The situation prevailing in the province towards the Hindus is just a glimpse of the hostility towards our community,” he says. “The problem should be identified at the state level. But, unfortunately, nothing is being done on the part of the state.”

The Sindh government did, however, get involved and tried to work towards a solution.

To control the growing incidents of alleged abductions of Hindu girls, their forced conversions and marriages below the legally fixed adult age of 18 years, the PPP-led Sindh government passed a law to criminalise such acts in 2014. The Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act sets the legal minimum age of marriage for boys and girls at 18 years. Religious groups had opposed the new law, which finally came into force following amendments to certain sections.

However, community leaders say that the new law in Sindh is being bypassed, as converted girls are being shifted to Punjab to register their marriages and conversions, because the legally fixed minimum age for marriage is 16 years in Punjab.

“Raveena and Reena were shifted to Rahim Yar Khan district in Punjab… This is the new trick to play with the law,” Eshwar Lal says. (Hari Lal, Reena and Raveena’s father, had claimed that his daughters were 14 and 16 when they were ‘abducted’. Case proceedings presided over by Chief Justice Islamabad High Court Athar Minallah had later found that the women aged 18 and 19 are adults.)

Activists and members of the Hindu community do not think that this act alone is enough. In 2016 the Sindh Assembly had unanimously passed a bill against forced conversions. But this was not signed into law due to pressure by some religious quarters.

Asad Iqbal Butt, HRCP’s vice-chairperson for the Sindh chapter, says that a very sophisticated and organised campaign is behind forced conversions of Hindu girls by religious leaders.

“These spiritual leaders’ devotees first earn the trust of Hindu girls, and then motivate them to change their religion in some cases,” he alleges. “In other instances, the devotees kidnap the girls with the support of their pirs. Since the converted girls are not allowed to meet their families, we do not know what becomes of them,” he says.

Human rights groups have been voicing their concerns over the situation in the province for a while.

“In a majority of the cases, the girls say that they want to live with their husbands, so the judges allow them to go with their husbands,” says Zahida Detho, an activist closely working with the minority community. But she says, in many cases, the girls give these statements because they face threats at the hands of their kidnappers, who have warned them that they will cause harm to their family members unless they comply.

“The actual story unfolds when a kidnapped girl returns to her family, which is very rare,” says Detho.

Radha’s was such a rare case. Her father Vinesh had clearly mentioned in his plaint that his daughter’s kidnappers were being protected by the influential village pir Ayub Jan Sarhandi — known for having converted hundreds of Hindus, mostly women.

THE PIR OF THARPARKAR

Sarhandi’s residence is located around 20 kilometres off the Umerkot road, where he also runs a madressah for boys. Members of the Hindu community and human rights activists in the Mirpurkhas division claim that Sarhandi uses force and his influence to suppress Hindus living in Tharparkar.

On a sunny morning, Sarhandi is sitting in his courtyard, wearing a crisp white cotton shalwar kameeez and matching headgear. He occasionally strokes his long grey beard as he carefully listens to the allegations against him. He raises his eyebrows from time to time, but does not interrupt us or lose his temper.

He takes a moment before responding. We can hear young boys reciting the Quran in the madressah.

Finally, Sarhandi responds to our questions about the community’s accusations of him patronising forced conversions of underage Hindu girls and marrying them off to Muslim men after they have abducted the girls and sexually assaulted them.

“It is all propaganda by the NGOs [non-governmental organisations] that are agents of India’s spy agency RAW [Research and Analysis Wing] and Western donors that want to defame Pakistan,” the cleric says.

He says that the claim that they only convert Hindu women is utterly false. He signals a young devotee to bring a logbook in which he and his men have recorded each conversion.

One would expect Sarhandi to be perturbed by the laundry list of heinous acts he is accused of committing. Instead, the pir manages to maintain a sense of humour during the interview. He opens the logbook. “This is Bheero Kohli,” he says. “A relative of the Indian cricketer Virat Kohli,” he jokes. He then continues to point out names of Hindu men who have come to him to embrace Islam.

Sarhandi vehemently opposes the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act that criminalises marriages of underage children. “There is no age religiously determined to embrace Islam,” he says. “Similarly, no age limit was fixed for the marriage of women.”

Sarhandi believes that people like him are the real victims and the media continues to misrepresent them, running “one-sided” stories. “Please [publish] my complete version,” he requests, giving us a knowing smile.

But men like Sarhandi and Mian Mithu routinely find themselves surrounded by journalists, taking notes and photographs as they speak. Their views on the topic of alleged forced conversions are extensively documented. As are those of representatives of the Hindu community, parents of the girls who have been allegedly abducted and human rights activists who are demanding change. The missing voices are those of the girls.

Girls like Reena, Raveena and Simran are only seen speaking in carefully curated short videos that are circulated online. Pirs like Mian Mithu speak on behalf of women like Faryal Bibi. Even in a rare case like Radha’s, where a girl has returned home after defiantly speaking her mind, she is mostly confined to her home after marriage to a Hindu man. Everyone seems to have something to say about alleged forced conversions of Sindh’s Hindu girls, except the girls themselves.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1541497,3/17/20 7:11,"‘My body, my choice’","MANY South Asian men have been unable to come to terms with this slogan — too bad for them. They are fighting a rearguard action because the arc of history has been bending towards equality. In the West, slaves have gained equality as have Jews, while people of colour and women have made significant gains. In South Asia, Dalits continue to advance their rights. Contrary cases of infringement of minority rights invite universal condemnation. So, it is only a matter of time before women effectively obtain the rights that are guaranteed to them under most constitutions.

Objections against the slogan raise interesting issues. Consider the men who protest their support for women, but suggest more appropriate slogans. The irony in doing so is lost on them. This is precisely the suffocating embrace of patriarchy the women are contesting. By subjecting the modalities of struggle to their approval, men deny women the agency that is their right which includes the right to be wrong. Men deciding for women is an anachronism no longer acceptable to many.

But there is a deeper irony at play. This slogan, or at least its essence, was directed first to men. And, more surprisingly, it was not oppressed men raising it against their oppressors. Quite the contrary, it was the oppressors who forced ‘your body, your choice’ upon the oppressed.

Here is the back story. Capitalism, gaining strength in 17th- and 18th-century Europe, had two essential pillars: the sanctity of private property and the free availability of wage labour. Under feudalism, which preceded capitalism, labour was unfree, bound to feudal lords. In order to break this bond, the ideologues of capitalism extended the analogy of private property to the human body. The view was propagated that workers owned their bodies and could do with them what they chose free of the ties that indentured them to feudal lords. Meanwhile, the accompanying Enclo­sure Movement turned all land into private property depriving peasants of sustenance from common holdings. Thus were free labourers created to do with their bodies as they chose. It was another matter that the only choice was to sell their bodies to the highest bidder.

Objections against the slogan raise interesting issues.

There was one positive though unintended outcome of this new enslavement: the emergence of civil rights. The body, now private property, was entitled to the same protection as land or capital. Violating its sanctity became a crime subject to legal redress. And this set into motion a new dynamic in Europe. Once all bodies were acknowledged equal under the law, it was logical to demand an extension to the right to vote. A struggle for political rights ensued, progressively extending the franchise and culminating in universal suffrage; women were the last to be included, as late as the 1940s. Political rights were then leveraged to wrest economic rights like minimum wage, unemployment insurance, and retirement benefits. This journey from civil to economic rights was spread over almost 300 years, and it was not repeated in the same sequence in other parts of the world.

In South Asia, for example, one of the most unequal societies in the world, political rights came first, a consequence of the end of colonial rule. These political rights yielded a modicum of economic rights, most obvious in the case of Dalits in India. But conspicuous by their absence were any semblance of civil rights acknowledging the sanctity and equality of the human body. Dr. Ambedkar noted this straight away when he pointed out soon after Independence that one-person-one-vote could yield one-vote-one-value, but not one-person-one-value. Only a regime of civil rights could ensure the latter.

This brings us full circle to the ferocity encountered by the women’s movement and the underlying threat of interpersonal violence pervasive in South Asia. The infliction of pain on the human body is commonly viewed as a just and effective corrective. This explains popular views that South Asians can only be ruled by the stick, that suspects ought to be beaten till they confess, or that unpopular leaders should be strung upside down or lined up against a wall and shot. It is in this milieu that men could be slapped and women thrashed, or spat upon, or shamed to be taught a lesson with no consequences whatsoever.

We are far from the day when opposing views can be engaged with in a civil manner without threat of violence. The women’s movement, if only for highlighting this issue, is playing a salutary role in dragging us into a more civilised future.

Finally, one should not minimise the perils of translation. The body is just a body in the West. In South Asia, men, and many women, divest it of its vestments. The road to the future passes over rocky cultural terrain on which Neanderthals not only continue to roam, but are often invited to grace the insides of TV studios.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1308798,1/16/17 15:55,Mother sentenced to death for 'honour killing' of daughter Zeenat Bibi,"An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Lahore on Monday sentenced a mother to death in a case of 'honour killing' for burning her daughter alive in June 2016 after she contracted a 'free-will marriage'.

18-year-old Zeenat Rafiq of Lahore's Factory Area was set on fire by her mother Parveen Bibi more than a week after the girl reportedly eloped with Hasan Khan to marry him before a court in Lahore.

Parveen Bibi had earlier confessed she had murdered her daughter for ""bringing shame to the family"".

Police had suspected that Parveen was helped by her son and son-in-law in killing the girl.

ATC-IV judge Chaudhry Muhammad Ilyas on Monday sentenced Parveen to death in the 'honour killing' case, and sentenced Zeenat's brother Anees to life in prison. Zeenat's sister's husband was acquitted in the case.

It was revealed in court that Zeenat's mother and brothers had first beaten her, then her mother threw kerosene on her and set her on fire.

Parveen in court today accepted responsibility for Zeenat's death.

Zeenat's husband, Hasan Khan last June had agreed to let his wife return to her home after her family promised, in the days before her murder, to organise a traditional wedding reception for the couple.

He earlier told the media that Zeenat was not willing to go back to her parents’ home because she feared they would kill her. ""But she agreed after her family gave assurances regarding her safety,"" he was quoted by a TV channel as saying.

Witnesses had told Dawn that they had alerted the emergency rescue service after they saw smoke coming out of Parveen’s home.

""Police and rescue firefighters reached the spot, put out the blaze and recovered the body of the girl,"" a witness had said earlier.

After Zeenat Bibi was set on fire in a low-income neighbourhood of Lahore, none of her relatives sought to claim her body, police said, leaving her husband's family to bury her charred remains in the dark in a graveyard near the city.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1591257/australian-special-forces-allegedly-killed-39-unarmed-afghans-report,11/19/20 20:05,Australian special forces allegedly killed 39 unarmed Afghans: report,"Australian special forces allegedly killed 39 unarmed prisoners and civilians in Afghanistan, with senior commandos reportedly forcing junior soldiers to kill defenceless captives in order to “blood” them for combat, a four-year investigation found.

Australia said on Thursday that 19 current and former soldiers will be referred for potential criminal prosecution for allegedly killing the 39 Afghan locals.

Detailing the findings of a long-awaited inquiry into the conduct of special forces personnel in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016, Australia's General Angus John Campbell said there was credible information of 39 unlawful killings by 25 Australian Special Forces personnel in 23 separate incidents. All of those kills were outside the “heat of battle”, Campbell said.

“These findings allege the most serious breaches of military conduct and professional values,” Campbell told reporters in Canberra.

“The unlawful killing, of civilians and prisoners is never acceptable.”

The report said the majority of those killed, which included prisoners, farmers and other Afghan locals, were captured when they were killed and therefore protected under international law.

Following the recommendations of the report, Campbell said 19 current and former members of Australia's military will be referred to a soon-to-be appointed special investigator to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to prosecute.

Australia's Minister for Defence Linda Reynolds said last week that Canberra had been advised that local prosecution would negate charges at the International Criminal Court at The Hague.

'Blooding'

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had earlier warned the report would include “difficult and hard news for Australians”, but few expected some of the most shocking revelations.

While the report was heavily redacted, it included allegations that senior special forces personnel ordered the killing of unarmed Afghans.

“There is credible information that junior soldiers were required by their patrol commanders to shoot a prisoner, in order to achieve the soldier's first kill, in a practice that was known as 'blooding',” the report read.

Once a person had been killed, those allegedly responsible would stage a fight scene with foreign weapons or equipment to justify their action, the report concluded.

The actions did not immediately come to light due to what the report concluded was a culture of secrecy and compartmentalisation in which information was kept and controlled within patrols.

The veil of secrecy was a key reason that the allegations took so long to come to light.

Although it has been the subject of rumour, Australia's official investigation only began after the publication of classified documents about alleged war crimes in Afghanistan.

A former military lawyer, David McBride, has been charged with providing the classified papers to the Australian Broadcasting Corp. He admits that he supplied the papers, but says it is in the national interest.

The four-year inquiry was conducted by New South Wales state Judge Paul Brereton, who was appointed by the Inspector-General of Defence in 2016 to investigate rumours of war crimes in Afghanistan between 2003 and 2016.

The inquiry examined more than 20,000 documents and 25,000 images, and interviewed 423 witnesses under oath.

The report recommended Canberra should compensate victims' families even without a successful prosecution.

Campbell said he would seek to revoke citations for special operations task groups that served in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2013.

The release of the report came after Morrison spoke with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.

“The Prime Minister of Australia expressed his deepest sorrow over the misconduct by some Australian troops in Afghanistan,” Ghani's office wrote on Twitter.

Australia has had troops in Afghanistan since 2002 as part of the US-led coalition fighting the Taliban militia.

“The Prime Minister of Australia expressed his deepest sorrow over the misconduct by some Australian troops in Afghanistan,” Ghani's office wrote on Twitter.","['troops', 'forces', 'australian', 'afghanistan', 'report', 'campbell', '39', 'special', 'soldiers', 'prisoners', 'unarmed', 'afghans', 'allegedly', 'killed']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/11/5fb6877971b5b.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/11/5fae0d9f0b8ee.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/11/5dd20c6a85652.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/09/5f50797b8b9bf.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/11/5dd20c6a85652.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/11/5fae0d9f0b8ee.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/11/5fb6877971b5b.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd306ee076b9.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/09/5f50797b8b9bf.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/11/5fb6877971b5b.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': '19 current and former soldiers to be referred for potential criminal prosecution for allegedly killing the Afghan locals.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1591257', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Australian special forces allegedly killed 39 unarmed Afghans: report', 'description': '19 current and former soldiers to be referred for potential criminal prosecution for allegedly killing the Afghan locals.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/11/5fb6877971b5b.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1591257', 'title': 'Australian special forces allegedly killed 39 unarmed Afghans: report', 'description': '19 current and former soldiers to be referred for potential criminal prosecution for allegedly killing the Afghan locals.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/11/5fb6877971b5b.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-11-19 20:05:56', 'modified_time': '2020-11-20 02:52:32', 'tag': 'Afghan War', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/422/reuters'}, 'keywords': 'Afghan War', 'news_keywords': 'Afghan War', 'author': 'Reuters'})",[],dawn

https://www.dawn.com/news/611583,3/8/11 2:03,UN must condemn China ‘one child’ policy: lawmaker,"WASHINGTON: UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon must step up public condemnation of China’s “one-child” policy and investigate the alleged use of forced abortions to carry it out, a key US lawmaker said Monday.

“To fail to speak out against what is by far the worst gender-based violence in history would make a mockery of the UN’s claim to promote women,” Republican Representative Chris Smith said in an appeal to Ban.

Smith also urged Ban to direct special UN envoys for violence against women, torture, and trafficking in persons to travel to China to investigate the way the policy is applied and its effects on women and girls.

China, under a 1980 policy designed to control its population, permits most couples to have only one child, an approach critics charge is backed with forced sterilizations and abortions.

The lawmaker — a long-time foe of abortion and a sharp critic of Beijing — also complained that the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) was backing China’s policy, which he described as “the most massive human rights violation in the world today” and said the agency must “cease and desist.”

A US State Department report in 2002 found “no evidence that UNFPA has knowingly supported or participated in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization” in China.

Smith also criticized President Barack Obama for hosting a state dinner for Chinese President Hu Jintao, “who oversees the most heinous attack on women ever.”

“We’re calling on the administration to make a serious attempt, which it has not made heretofore, to raise this issue” with Chinese authorities, Smith told reporters at a press conference outside the US Capitol.

“Our hope is that the White House will take this issue up in a very serious fashion — Certaintly they need to defund the UN Population Fund which is the cheerleader- and enabler-in-chief of the last 30 years of this policy,” he said.","['Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

“Our hope is that the White House will take this issue up in a very serious fashion — Certaintly they need to defund the UN Population Fund which is the cheerleader- and enabler-in-chief of the last 30 years of this policy,” he said.","['child', 'state', 'population', 'president', 'condemn', 'women', 'violence', 'smith', 'unfpa', 'serious', 'china', 'lawmaker', 'policy']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd337468dd26.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/2011/03/543x27528.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2efebbe9a2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/2011/03/543x27528.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg'}",TRUE,http://i.dawn.com/2011/03/543x27528.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'China, under a 1980 policy designed to control its population, permits most couples to have only one child, an...', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/2011/03/08/un-must-condemn-china-one-child-policy-lawmaker/', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'UN must condemn China ‘one child’ policy: lawmaker', 'description': 'China, under a 1980 policy designed to control its population, permits most couples to have only one child, an...', 'image': 'http://i.dawn.com/2011/03/543x27528.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/2011/03/08/un-must-condemn-china-one-child-policy-lawmaker/', 'title': 'UN must condemn China ‘one child’ policy: lawmaker', 'description': 'China, under a 1980 policy designed to control its population, permits most couples to have only one child, an...', 'image': 'http://i.dawn.com/2011/03/543x27528.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2011-03-08 02:03:26', 'modified_time': '2011-03-08 02:03:26', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/119/afp'}, 'author': 'AFP'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1302057,12/12/16 16:32,Mob 'besieging' Ahmadi place of worship in Chakwal dispersed by police,"A charged mob of around 1,000 people which reportedly besieged an Ahmadi place of worship in Chakwal was dispersed by police on Monday, officials said.

The place of worship located in the limits of the Chowas Saidan Shah police station area in Chakwal's Dhalmial district was 'attacked' by nearly 1,000 people, according to the Jamaat-i-Ahmaddiya Pakistan Spokesperson Saleem-ud-Din.

Saleem-ud-Din said a mob armed with batons and weapons was throwing stones and firing on the premises. The mob was ""attempting to seize Ahmadiyya property,"" he said.

Deputy Commissioner Chakwal Mahmood Javed Bhatti said the mob hurled stones and bricks at the place of worship before storming the building, adding that gunmen opened fire on Ahmadis in the area. The DC said that police have now dispersed the crowd and secured the building.

Rashid Ahmad, a local police official, said the mob also set fire to part of the building.

Station House Officer Chowas Saidan Shah Sub Inspector (SI) Muhammad Nawaz told Dawn that police had dispersed the crowd. The situation is under control now, he confirmed, adding that police had not decided on what action to take.

District police officer Chakwal said that a dialogue between local religious leaders and district administration is ongoing.

SI Muhammad Nawaz added that there had been no reports of any casualties.

The Jamaat-i-Ahmaddiya Pakistan spokesperson, however, claimed that there had been one killed in the incident, but was unable to identify the dead.

The Government of Punjab earlier said it was ""following up"" on the Chakwal incident.

The provincial government's Twitter claimed, ""As per details, a misunderstanding developed between the two groups. Home Department is vigilantly following up the issue.""

It is unclear which groups were involved in the incident.

Request for security

In a letter addressed to the district coordination officer, the Ahmadiyya community requested provision of security at its Dhalmial place of worship.

Letter sent by Ahmadiyya community dated December 5

The letter is dated December 5.

The letter stated that the life and property of Ahmadis might be endangered and the procession planned for today might ""try to forcibly occupy Ahmadi's worship place"".

It was also claimed in the letter that similar reports have been received from the villages of Bohn and Puchnand.

""You are kindly requested to take adequate security measures to protect the life and properties and worship places of the Ahmadia community,"" added the letter.","['Imran Gabol', 'Dawn.Com', 'M.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1383093,1/15/18 17:15,"No, death penalty is not a solution to child sexual abuse","In 2016, eleven children in Pakistan reported being sexually abused every day, a 10% increase from the previous year. That is an average total of 4,015 every year. The numbers likely quadruple when one takes into account those children who suffer in silence.

In Pakistan, a country where 31% of the population is below the age of 14, silence is, in fact, often the only recourse available to victim-children.

Out of the 1,172 cases of rape, including gang-rape and sodomy, that were reported in 2016, only a handful made their way into public discourse.

The rest were forced to find their own way through a criminal justice system that provides virtually no safeguards for child complainants, hangs onto archaic procedures of investigating sexual crimes, and holds virtually zero convictions for sexual crimes in most districts.

Given the government’s pithy record in addressing child sexual abuse, the outrage and shock at the tragic murder of six-year-old Zainab in Kasur demonstrates our collective ignorance towards the plight of the most vulnerable.

Read next: Kasur as a political failure

In 2004, Punjab enacted The Punjab Destitute and Neglected Children Act with the aim of providing the province with its first ever institutional and legal framework for the prevention and protection of children against abuse and exploitation.

However, the district child protection units envisioned under the law were established only in six districts and even those remain non-functional today.

A Child Protection and Welfare Bureau, with the chief minister as its patron-in-chief, was tasked with the establishment and management of the child protection units.

However, in the eight-year tenure of the current chief minister, not a single meeting of the bureau has been conducted.

August, 2015 was the first time in Pakistan’s recent history that the public was forced to confront the impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators of child sexual abuse when vile video tapes, showing the molestation of over 400 children between 2006-2014, surfaced in Kasur.

A high-level inquiry committee constituted by the Punjab government dismissed the reports as baseless and the result of land disputes between a few parties.

In absence of any law criminalising acts of child sexual abuse, pornography and trafficking, the few arrests that were made could only be charged under general sections for sodomy and rape under the Pakistan Penal Code.

While the events were enough to jolt the legislature into finally pushing a bill through the parliament in March, 2016, as always, actual implementation remains wanting. That same year, civil society recorded 100 deaths of children as a result of rape.

Editorial: Protect our children

Protecting children from exploitation has never been on agendas nationwide. This holds true both politically and socially.

It is no surprise that Punjab, the province where 62% of all child sexual abuse cases occurred in 2017, has failed to develop its own child protection policy.

The draft developed by the Social Welfare Department has failed to attain approval of the cabinet because of other ‘more important agenda items.’

Any attempt to introduce Life Skills Based Education (LSBE) in mainstream curricula is instantaneously thwarted.

The Punjab government, in 2011, cancelled a memorandum of understanding for the inclusion of LSBE in curricula of public schools, bowing to right wing pressure.

Parents have often joined opposition against LSBE and have seldom taken it upon themselves to equip their offspring with any knowledge necessary to protect themselves against sexual abuse.

In fact, sexual abuse, particularly occurring within the home and family, is muted for the benefit of ‘family honour.’

Despite the dismal public and private safeguards in place against child sexual abuse, the call for action in the wake of Zainab’s horrific death has singularly focused on police negligence and public punishment for the perpetrator.

What remains missing from the debate is our social and political unwillingness to recognise the complete lack of child-responsive legal and social institutions in the country that prioritise child welfare above all other considerations.

Confronted with the heart-wrenching reality, we can no longer ignore the silent suffering of children.

However, holding on to the belief that public and extreme punishment for the perpetrator will remedy our consistent neglect and apathy towards the vulnerable, is grossly misguided.

Punishing a single perpetrator will simply appease our consciences under the false illusion that we have taken sufficient action to finally address the high rates of public and private sexual abuse and exploitation.

However, it is unlikely that the alarming rates of child sexual abuse will decrease without the implementation of child protection units at the district level, along with LSBE in school curricula and willingness at home to openly talk about the issue.

Social media has irresponsibly claimed that a public hanging in Iran solved the country’s child sexual abuse problem. Civil society and media reports continue to show high rates of child sex abuse in the country.

A recent study showed that around 100 to 150 children living on the streets are killed every month in Tehran for reasons including abuse.

According to government reports, over 21% of these children experience sexual exploitation, including the gang rape of an 11-year-old girl in Tehran in June, 2015.

Additionally, the highest rise in AIDS in Iran has been reported to be the result of children working on the streets infected through rape.

Clearly, the tragic events surrounding Zainab’s death should lead us to finally push for a much better state of affairs for our country’s children.

The abduction of children has already accounted for hundreds of executions in Pakistan since a moratorium was lifted in December, 2014.

If we continue to hold the belief that adding another death to the mix will create any impact on the security of our children, then we will continue to let them down.

It’s high time that we prioritise the protection of our children in all legal and policy agendas, while implementing the already existing child safeguarding mechanisms.

We owe it to children like Zainab, and countless others like her, to finally convert the effort we put into our impassioned responses to implementing dedicated and long-term strategies to prevent child sexual abuse from happening further.","['Zainab Z.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1522984,12/18/19 15:11,Police arrest muezzin over alleged sexual assault of minor boy in Muzaffargarh,"Police arrested a man on Tuesday for allegedly sexually assaulting a minor boy in Muzaffargarh.

A First Information Report (FIR), dated December 17, was registered on the complaint of the victim's father at Sethpur station under Section 377 (unnatural offence) of the Pakistan Penal Code.

As per the FIR, the complainant's son went to a nearby mosque inside a shrine to study the Quran at around 6:30am. However, unusually, he returned early crying and told his father and others about the incident that had taken place.

According to the FIR, the suspect visited the mosque daily to offer prayers and is also a muezzin (who leads the call to prayer).

The report said that the suspect took the boy outside of the Tadrees-e-Quran room into the Darbar Sharif, where he allegedly assaulted him. The suspect also gave the victim Rs10 in an attempt to silence him but the victim refused and ran home.

Sethpur Station House Officer Malik Sharif Malana said that police arrested the suspect as soon as they received information of the incident and registered a case.","['Mohammad Ali', 'N Khan', 'F K Y', 'Shazad Khalid', 'Habib A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1395215,3/20/18 7:15,Special report: Sexual harassment in workplaces in Pakistan,"Misogyny in the workplace: Hidden in plain sight By Razeshta Sethna, Tooba Masood and Ramsha Jahangir Sexual harassment, abuse and discrimination in Pakistan’s workplaces, including universities, are pervasive, mostly unreported and ignored by senior managers, a Dawn survey of 300 women found. In response to being asked whether women were made to stay silent about workplace harassment, 61 per cent said their employers did not coerce them to keep quiet, but a significant 35pc were told to remain silent by their colleagues and bosses. The survey conducted through online questionnaires and interviews in Karachi, Islamabad, Lahore, Peshawar and Quetta collated responses from women in the workforce, across professions and industries, to gauge experiences of sexual harassment and whether workplaces have anti-sexual harassment policies in place. Nonetheless, when it comes to formal reporting mechanisms, testimonies from women suggest most lack faith in the process — only 17pc of those who experienced harassment approached their organisation’s internal inquiry committees. Despite 59pc reporting that their managements do take harassment seriously, most women expressed worry that managers wouldn’t sanction harassers and their work situations would not improve. Most women felt they would not be believed during investigations or when perpetrators had support in high places. A surgeon’s proposition Women in medicine shared stories of a toxic culture of misogyny. Some as students endured catcalling, comments about their body size (“they would rate us on a scale of one to ten,” said one) and gossip about their reputation. Some doctors said promotions were denied on the pretext that they were ‘less experienced’, not ‘as committed’ as male colleagues or because they didn’t succumb to sexual demands. Those who call out workplace misconduct are routinely portrayed as hysterical and malicious liars or whiners. One former medical student of a university hospital said her professor, a well-known orthopaedic surgeon, often paid her unwanted attention. Once, he propositioned her while she was operating on a patient under his supervision. “He stood so close to me, shoulder-to-shoulder in the operating room. He told me I’d have to come back to him if I cut my finger while operating. No one knows when you wear [surgical] masks what a doctor is whispering to you,” she said. “Female students would invariably get higher marks than male students. He had power over students he favoured. We knew his behaviour was problematic, so did our seniors, but by complaining we’d be jeopardising our careers. We were given warnings about some professors and male students we should steer clear of. It was a very uncomfortable environment. I hated it.” Hostile work environments Bad behaviour doesn’t have to be sexual to constitute harassment. In fact, everyday aggressions by male bosses often create humiliating work conditions for female subordinates. Women in technology speak of how managers denigrate their worth and work; improper touching and comments, bullying; and bosses taking credit for their achievements. Schoolteachers talk of promotions promised in return for sexual favours. One said she was publicly mocked for using the bathroom ‘too often’. Politicians said they are routinely criticised for their appearance — they must not look too feminine since that’s not associated with leadership, nor too masculine since that’s not their lot. Being perceived as usurping power in a man’s world makes them fair game, they said. Even legislative assemblies in which pro-women laws are sanctified are not safe from everyday sexism. Sexism in parliament In January 2017, PML-F’s Nusrat Sehar Abbasi was well into her second tenure in the Sindh assembly and accustomed to the frequent jeering and heckling by certain male legislators from the ruling party. Nonetheless, she decided enough was enough when PPP’s Imdad Pitafi invited her to come to his chamber for a ‘satisfactory response’ to a question she had asked, which prompted laughter from other members of the ruling party. She even threatened to immolate herself if he did not resign. “I didn’t get what he said at first because of the poor acoustics, not until other women told me. I wasn’t given the chance to respond because PPP’s deputy speaker Shehla Raza switched off my mike; she didn’t stand in my defence. I was fed up with the constant whistling and bad language used by male legislators,” Abbasi tells Dawn. “They believe women on reserved seats [are not elected] on our own merit. They don’t realise we do most of the work and pass the most bills, while they heckle us.” Pitafi eventually apologised on the floor of the house, after Bilawal and Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari urged him to do so. This was not an isolated incident. Many women lawmakers suffer inappropriate banter intended to publicly demean them. In June 2016, then defence minister Khawaja Asif called PTI’s Shireen Mazari a ‘tractor trolley’; in April 2017, PPP’s Khurshid Shah remarked that women would ‘fall ill’ if prevented from ‘chattering’; in Nov 2014, JUI-F’s Fazlur Rehman claimed PTI’s female supporters were of ‘bad character’. Failing to condemn this behaviour, women lawmakers mostly support their parties for fear of censure by male leaders. Enabling misconduct When women protect harassers they are actually ‘enabling’ these men and their misconduct, explains Nighat Dad of the Digital Rights Foundation. “Society is wired in such ways because of the stakes involved; even if you might know of their behaviour you will stay silent. Networks empower people and people don’t want to lose their communities. Often harassers are weaker but enablers allow them to become strong so they stay within communities and are not isolated. You won’t see these powerful enablers around complainants often so they become weak and isolated.” Silence and secrecy enforce perpetrators. If a woman cannot be completely silenced, they make sure she is disbelieved or shamed, say lawyers dealing with harassment cases. The more powerful the perpetrator, the more he is able to discredit the victim through his network of supporters. In the line of duty Senior police officer Maria Taimur admits women in the force won’t talk about harassment as much as they should. “At a higher level we don’t face intimidation as much, but lower entry-level constables and ASIs do. Women in the force can go to their DPOs or CPOs to complain, and have learnt to give men shut up calls. But often the matter is also hushed up. We have anti-harassment drives in most districts, we try to change mindsets, but it’s a slow process,” she said. Taimur raised another issue: “You can’t spot a harasser because often their demeanour is so respectful in public. This makes it easier for them to cover their tracks.” Having worked with male colleagues for over 12 years, Uzma, an ASI at Lahore’s Lower Mall police station is well versed in their psyche. “Tharak jhaartay hain aadat se majboor,” — they flirt out of habit — she said. Although women in the force can hold their own, she admits certain men try to cast them as being of ill repute. “What rubbish. Women work because they need to.” Still, women facing harassment are often caught between two bad choices. Put up or get out Of the women surveyed, more than half said they would leave their jobs if harassed. For 12pc, reactions of workplaces and families would determine whether they stayed. But many recognise that ignoring harassment or leaving the workplace altogether will only exacerbate the problem. “If it’s not one woman, then it’s another, which is why predators need to be held accountable,” said one interviewee. One of the Punjab ombudsperson’s first cases was a complaint from a junior clerk in the agriculture department in 2014, recollected Bushra Khaliq of Women in Struggle for Empowerment. The only woman in her office, for six months, her colleagues maligned her reputation, told dirty jokes in her presence and blew cigarette smoke in her face. “When the department failed to take her seriously, her family went to the police. Eleven people were nominated in the complaint, and each was given different levels of punishment.” But such an outcome is still an anomaly. In interviews, women explained how disciplinary action against harassers is virtually non-existent in a society where powerful men are immune from censure: “They usually get a slap on the wrist at most.” A law unto themselves One lawyer talked of misbehaviour in her profession: “My [former] boss, an influential former Senator and lawyer-politiian, made unwanted sexual advances, told me that at the civil courts women lawyers are sold for Rs500, and that he had slept with many ‘pretty women parliamentarians’. Once he tried to hug me, and when I told him specifically that this was not okay, he said his last employee was a tomboy and never hesitated to hug him. I left that law chamber.” Recalling her early days, another lawyer wrote of a senior colleague, a son of a high court judge, who would send her dozens of inappropriate, late-night text messages. “I never replied and would greet him the next day at work, pretending they had never happened. … The firm had no anti-harassment policy or procedure … I was made to believe that this was a rite of passage and that the messages would stop. … After I quit, I received another text from him calling me a slut.” Obstacles in enforcing workplace rights “Sexual harassment is a question of power and authority over women. The Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act is aimed essentially at behaviour correction, it doesn’t involve courts or the police directly,” states Khaliq. With its enactment and the amendment to Pakistan Penal Code Section 509, both in 2010, the real challenge is implementation. Legal experts argue that though sexual harassment in public spaces is now punishable with imprisonment and/or a fine, it has not served its purpose given the criminal justice system’s shortfalls. Meanwhile, although the civil law requires organisations to adopt a code of conduct and constitute internal inquiry committees, organisations often fail to implement it. “They don’t say they won’t comply, but some public organisations don’t. It was a nightmare to get PTV to nominate a committee. Banks, on the other hand, are more compliant because it is part of the State Bank’s audit,” explains Maliha Hassain of Mehergah. Under this law, if a complainant is not satisfied with the internal committee, they can approach their respective ombudsperson for cases of workplace harassment. But, eight years on, the only provincial ombudsperson’s post that is presently filled is Sindh’s — Punjab has had no ombudsperson since April 2017. And while compliance with rulings is almost universal according to former federal ombudsperson for harassment, retired justice Yasmin Abbasey, she admits that the high courts have sometimes issued stay orders to stop proceedings despite lacking the jurisdiction to do so. “Granted, it is risky for women to talk because of lack of supportive mechanisms. But they are more aware and understand they don’t need to tolerate this. The #MeToo conversations are trickling down to the grass roots,” Khaliq says. And what of the effects of these conversations? Of her own profession, Abbasi believes that speaking up will help to ensure that “the path for younger women to enter politics is not as difficult”. Uzma Al-Karim, former special adviser to the Sindh ombudsperson, believes only a mindset change will make workplaces safer for women. But, until then, “We have to enforce the law so that there is zero tolerance for all forms of harassment in a work environment.” Sanam Zeb, Asma Mojiz, Xari Jalil, Sarah Eleazar, Waseem Ahmed Shah, and Sadia Qasim Shah contributed to reporting. *Illustrations by Marium Ali If you are facing sexual harassment at work and would like to file a complaint, please follow the government's guidelines here and here.

Breaking the silence on sexism in academia By Razeshta Sethna, Sara Eleazar, Waseem Ahmed Shah and Tooba Masood For too long, sexism and sexual harassment in Pakistan’s universities have been considered routine experiences, tolerated by those in authority. Believing that the consequences of taking action are more damaging than staying silent, most women continue to put up with harassment and misconduct. This was the choice Navin G Haider confronted two years ago as assistant professor of history at Karachi University’s (KU) Pakistan Study Centre. She decided to formally report on the harassment she experienced on campus, not knowing what the consequences would be (the first harassment incident she reported was in February 2016, and then, another incident she suffered on 14 March of the same year.) Calling out harassment and discrimination became a noose around Navin Haider's neck. Haider decided to file a complaint to the university’s internal inquiry committee after Dr Jaffer Ahmed — then acting centre director, and her immediate boss — failed to take action against her alleged offender, a visiting faculty member teaching Urdu, Dr Sahar Ansari (Ahmed, who has known Ansari for decades, told Haider’s friend, an academic from a private university, that he was ‘neutral’ to both parties.) In her complaint, Haider alleged Ansari twice harassed her in the form of unwanted and inappropriate physical contact. Although she took a route rarely pursued by victims for fear of backlash, Haider says she was unprepared for what followed. With 27 years of teaching experience, she was now labelled a troublemaker — even a nuisance by KU’s top management. Calling out harassment and discrimination became a noose around her neck. Yet, as she soon discovered, she was not the only woman who had been harassed by Ansari. Haider says Ansari must have been around while she was a student at KU in the 1980s, but she rarely crossed his path until he began teaching Urdu at the centre in 2002. There, too, they hardly interacted. “My limited interaction with Dr Ansari can be traced to December 2015 when he came into my room, sat on a chair next to me to look at student theses he could possibly use for an Urdu magazine for which he had just been appointed editor,” she says. In an interview with Dawn, Ansari claims, “Through the years we were friendly as colleagues could be. She told me she would get me work on a translation project at the Ismaili community centre in 2000. [In other words] there were ample chances for me take any liberties [with her] if I wanted to. But at this age [reportedly mid-70s] and with my background I would not.” Haider says she was unaware of what she stated was Ansari’s apparent predilection for fair-skinned women until she filed her complaint and other alumni and students begun to speak of their experiences with him. She learnt that he took their numbers on the pretext of contacting them about academic work, and instead called them incessantly at night — asking them out to lunch, commenting on their physical appearance and marriage eligibility. Some claimed he had groped them. A male staffer corroborated this. “A computer operator at the centre told me he had witnessed how Ansari swept his hand right from the top of a woman’s shoulders to her buttocks. He was also one of the many witnesses who recorded his statement during the official inquiry,” Haider tells Dawn. “In fact, Dr Ahmed’s wife and the centre’s current director had also warned her female students — I teach the same students in my history classes — to keep their distance from Dr Ansari. Something these girls told much later. Boys in his class knew he’d grade girls’ exams higher if they flirted with him,” she explains. Haider’s ground level office — a tiny room packed with books and papers — is at the end of a drab, quiet corridor. It was here around noon one day in February 2016 that Ansari, without knocking, walked in while she was at her desk, engrossed in work. He strode right up to her, grabbed her hands in a tight handshake, and would not let go. “It is friendship day, he told me. Besides, I like you beyond work, he said to me,” Haider says. Ansari explains he was being friendly, not inappropriate, by shaking hands. As the second inquiry committee ruling (a copy of which is available with Dawn) in January 2018 noted, Ansari denied that standing too close to a woman, hugging or touching her hands would make her feel uneasy and be inappropriate. He asserts he was made a scapegoat by Haider, who was displeased with Ahmed’s way of handling the centre’s affairs. The ‘troublemaker’ complains Even though her boundaries had been violated, Haider knew it was pointless complaining to the director. “I was angry and vulnerable at this point for reasons concerning my work and promotions as well. I knew he was a friend of the acting director and that meant I should stay quiet. I would be called a liar if I spoke out. What evidence did I have? Also, being concerned about the manner in which contract faculty was hired and their tenure extended, I had written a letter to the university’s board of governors outlining corrupt practices in 2014, so I was perceived as a troublemaker internally,” she says. Instead, she avoided him. She kept her office door locked, she recalls, and would avoid the library where Ansari would tutor mostly female students after class. On March 14, 2016 Haider went to Ahmed’s office to discuss something when she spotted Ansari leaving the same office. She moved aside to make way for him, she said, but instead of walking past her to the door, he grabbed her by the shoulders and shoved her against the director’s personal assistant’s table (the assistant was out for lunch at the time). Holding on to her shoulders, he said, “Aap hichkicha kiu rahi ahin?” (“Why are you hesitant?”) Horrified, Haider’s reaction was to yell, “What are you doing? Are you mad? Do you have no shame?” Humiliated and stressed, she reported the incident to Ahmed that very afternoon, after which she submitted a written complaint to the university’s vice chancellor. When Haider’s complaint was investigated by an internal inquiry committee (a committee member, for instance, was Ansari’s former student Dr Seemi Tahir) it absolved him of all charges in May 2016. Despite testimonies furnished by alumni and students about Ansari’s misconduct, in its judgment (a copy of which is available with Dawn) it recommended that “[Haider] should be asked to improve her temperament”. “They concluded I was insane,” she says. It further stated that she “unnecessarily provoked the students towards agitation and boycott to settle her personal problem”. In June 2016, she filed an appeal against this decision with the office of retired justice Shahnawaz Tariq, the provincial ombudsperson for the protection against harassment of women, explaining the inquiry committee had disregarded witness testimonies (16 people reporting harassment by Ansari had come forward), and failed to record statements and cross-examine both parties — all of which are legally binding. Noting these discrepancies, the ombudsperson wrote to KU in August 2017 asking that a second committee “of independent, impartial and honest” officers submit a report in 30 days. Noting that “any unpermitted and unconsented touch of the body of a female by any male is amounting to cause harassment”, the ombudsperson’s decision stated: “Neither the Inquiry Committee had made transparency nor ensured the impartiality while conducting the inquiry proceedings as well as passing its decision.” In January 2018, a second committee headed by Dr Nasreen Aslam Shah ruled that Ansari behaved inappropriately with Haider. Its findings noted all witness statements about Ansari’s reputation for the type of attention he paid his female students. The report (a copy is available with Dawn) stated no one regardless of their age, profession or fame has the right to harass another person on campus or otherwise. Also, incidents such as these will deter women from studying at KU unless strict action is taken against harassers, it elaborated. Denying he had touched Haider outside the director’s office, Ansari claims: “She wanted to create a law and order situation in [the director’s] centre. If I had held her shoulders, why did she not push me away? Isn’t that unnatural — she didn’t yell? … She is bold, an activist … She is stout and healthy, and I am a semi-handicapped person.” During an interview with Dawn, Ansari was asked twice if he had expected Haider to push him back. He responded in the affirmative both times — only if he attempted to touch her shoulders, he added suddenly, asserting he had not touched her. Defining harassment in Punjab Based on data collected from 260 students from 12 departments, a 2017 study in the Research Journal of South Asian Studies highlights the pervasiveness of harassment at Punjab University, including one incident that received much media attention. “Two years ago, the termination of the services of a professor … who reportedly kept a bedroom next to his office on university premises, was initially applauded. However, recently, despite the university’s resistance, he has returned to the university due to political pressure.” Clarifying the above, Dr Zakaria Zakar told Dawn the accused professor had not returned, but the court had restored his pension benefits as he had retired during the same time. Before being appointed interim VC this year, Zakar headed the committee for investigating harassment complaints. According to him, students’ complaints about verbal harassment on campus, such as catcalling, do not fall under the purview of the Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, as the law primarily provides cover to employees. His interpretation of the law — including the definition of workplace sexual harassment and whom it should apply to — is antithetical to the views expressed by competent authorities such as the federal ombudsperson, who ruled: “The fact remains that work means physical and mental effort or activity directed to the production or accomplishment of something that one is doing, making or performing especially as an occupation or undertaking a duty or a task therefore, the act equally applies to employer, employee and students.” Across the country, many within academia have reported that the most common harassment they face is ogling, sexual and vulgar comments, and unwanted touching. All felt angry and degraded though many are shamed and blamed; many researchers and teachers leave their jobs, while students are forced to endure continued harassment if they want to finish their degrees. Many more try to ignore the harassment and avoid the harasser. In April 2017, over 50 students (mostly female) signed a petition against four students at the Government College Lahore claiming verbal harassment at a bus stop. After several months of initial hearings, an inquiry committee comprising only men was established, which goes against the law: one woman on a minimum three-member committee is mandatory. According to sources privy to the hearings, the questions posed to students ranged from irrelevant to downright absurd, while the committee only appeared sympathetic after one of the complainants burst into tears. The questions included: “You have stated that you were walking to the bus and plugging in your hands-free device when one of the boys cat-called you. Why were you using a hands-free device?” and “How do you know [the harassers’] names? You found out from Facebook? Why are you on Facebook?” Fighting against a powerful harasser Even though the law is clear that sexual harassment is discrimination, a violation of rights and therefore illegal, perpetrators do not face the full force of the law. The appointment of Saqlain Naqvi as VC of Bacha Khan University (BKU) in Charsadda is under review in the Peshawar High Court (PHC) for these very reasons. In a December 2016 judgment by the federal ombudsperson, Naqvi was censured for sexual harassment while dean of the faculty of sciences at Arid Agriculture University in Rawalpindi. A researcher complained that his behaviour was the reason for the 10-month delay in her PhD thesis examination, because of which she had not been awarded her degree. Although she attended only one course with Naqvi, his extraordinary attention towards her made her extremely uneasy. He made it untenable for her to stay, and so she quit the university. Denying the allegations, BKU’s management told the PHC that the Rawalpindi bench of the Lahore High Court set the ombudsperson’s decision aside on April 18, 2017. However, the petitioner’s counsel told Dawn that the LHC had set aside the ombudsperson’s order on technical grounds and referred the issue to the Punjab provincial ombudsperson, as Arid University was not in the federal ombudsperson’s jurisdiction. It had not referred to the merits of the case. With no ombudsperson appointed in Punjab, the case remains in limbo. In interviews, professors and students have told Dawn they are either dissuaded from making officials complaints, withdraw their allegations or ignore serial offenders fearing the impact on their education and careers. Students harassed by male professors who have authority over them, including the power to manipulate grades, are often intimidated by the consequences of reporting. A former student at a private university narrates her experience. There are cases where some senior male faculty attempt to trade grades for sexual favours. At the University of Peshawar, there are no well-established mechanisms for addressing complaints, says Noreen Naseer, a professor of political science in a faculty dominated by male staff. There are cases where some senior male faculty attempt to trade grades for sexual favours. As a senior female staff member, she feels responsible for younger students, often warning them to stay away from those known for predatory behaviour. When a student was heard screaming in a professor’s office, the entire department was aware because she ran out crying, Naseer tells Dawn. The professor claimed he had asked her to take off her hijab so he could identify her. An investigative committee was formed, but the teacher is still on campus. “Because he belonged to the Jamaat-i-Islami the case was hushed up, even though other parties protested on campus. The woman got scared and didn’t pursue it,” she says. Women told Dawn that when they do complain, in most cases universities downplay any wrongdoing and seek to keep matters quiet to protect their own reputation. A teacher at a private university in Karachi discusses the power dynamics contributing to workplace harassment However ironic, it is often conservatism that deters potential perpetrators from pursuing and harassing women in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The fear that he will be killed by a woman’s male relatives might be one restraining factor, explains Naseer, but clearly not enough to keep older men away from young students. One professor on condition of anonymity said she even threatened to throw a senior professor in her department “out the window” if he didn’t stop harassing a young student who had come to her not knowing what to do. “I was so angry at him for pursuing a 19-year-old student. There was no other way to get the message to him so I said what I did. Inexperienced younger women feel older men paying them attention is all good, not knowing it involves much more. I requested he let her finish her studies; stay away from her because she was uninterested in him. He would send her vulgar, bold messages — becoming demanding. She refused to press charges. This wasn’t the first time he had intimidated a woman into having sexual contact with him. And he had high-level contacts. But when your provincial assembly is sitting on bills to protect women, what can you do?” she says. The cost of staying silent Repressed anger accompanied with the trauma of harassment leads to psychological problems, says Kashif Faraz Ahmed, chairperson of the applied psychology department at the Government Islamia College Civil Lines, at a recent seminar. Because of the way harassment complaints are often dealt with, victims end up blaming themselves leading to low self-esteem and mental and physical health issues — especially if the case becomes public. Feminist activist Aimen Bucha explains, “Just because you have never seen it happen or haven’t harassed anyone, doesn’t mean that this doesn’t happen”. Even then, it is hard to uncover the real scale of harassment on campuses. Our research points to a culture of impunity protecting powerful offenders. Victims, meanwhile, feel anger, remorse, shame and guilt — even when they do complain. It’s a boys’ club so that’s the bigger battle I doubt I will win,

says Navin Haider “Unfortunately, behaviours which may constitute inappropriate conduct are normalised in society; victims who have not been physically assaulted are not considered victims of harassment,” says psychologist Mary Pervaiz. Dealing with the consequences of calling out predatory behaviour is tantamount to silent suffering. “It’s a boys’ club so that’s the bigger battle I doubt I will win,” Haider says. Though reconciled with her choices, she has already paid a price for her bold stance. Nearing retirement, her chances of getting a promotion are virtually non-existent; she has suffered a personal loss while fighting her case and her health is affected. Women who do not stay silent know that unwittingly allowing such things to happen will not create change in workplaces. Though the cost of going public is high, it will translate into long-lasting change, they say — only then will the fundamental attitude of society towards women undergo transformation. These voices heard will only upend power relations.

Improving the workplace for women Interview by Aasma Mojiz Retired Justice Yasmin Abbasey, former federal ombudsperson for protection against harassment of women at the workplace, talks to Dawn about the ambit of the anti-harassment law. What kind of behaviour constitutes workplace harassment according to the Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010? YA) The perception that this law only deals with direct [physical] sexual harassment — which is often not possible in the office — is not the case. There are many forms of harassment in the workplace that are all covered in the law. Harassment does not just mean in terms of physical or sexual assault. It also means unnecessarily interfering in the work of others by harming their progress or promotion. Men tend to submit complaints of hostile work environments; women also have the same issues, where there is so much interference in their work that they are not able to perform, and that interference is affecting their career. This law does in fact apply to both men and women in the workplace. However, most cases are women reporting harassment by male colleagues. What kind of workplace environment do women contend with? YA) Women in key positions usually do not face problems. They have gone through a process, they are at a position; they can handle the situation. But at the lower level, they do face problems. If there were no problems for women, this law would not have been made. Until now, harassment in the workplace has been ignored. But it is a painful experience for those affected and that is something that was not given credence in society; women felt it, but society did not. Besides specific incidents, women also face uncomfortable workplace environments. How do you combat something like that? YA) Harassment also applies to the kind of environment that makes women uncomfortable. During my tenure, the kind of cases that emerged meant I tried to evolve the law through my judgments. I have tried through my judgments to send a message that if you are spreading false rumours about someone, for example, that also constitutes harassment. It is not in writing, but you are spreading something baseless about another colleague — even if it is not",,,,,,,,,,,,dawn

https://www.dawn.com/news/817876/poverty-in-s-africa-three-cows-and-a-forced-marriage,12/13/09 0:00,Poverty in S. Africa: three cows and a forced marriage,"PALMERTON (South Africa) Nolizwi Sinama was 14 years old when her family swapped her for three cows and forced her into marrying a man three times her age.

Now staying at a local shelter for abused youth, the shy teenager fidgets nervously and fights back the tears as she talks about her three-year ordeal, during which she was raped daily.

Her family abandoned her at the house of her new “husband,” a 42-year-old widower from KwaCele village, in a once-forgotten practice that is now being revived by poor, rural South African families desperate for money.

Sinama's case mirrors that of hundreds of other girls in rural parts of the impoverished Eastern Cape province, where nearly 200,000 people live on less than a dollar a day.

The ancient marriage custom, called ukuthwalwa, meaning “to be carried” in the Xhosa language, is a pre-arranged act where a man who had tried in vain to court a woman resorts to forcing her into marriage.

In the past the victim was normally an adult, but now men as old as 60 are abducting pubescent girls and forcing them into illegal customary marriages, outraging cultural activists and welfare authorities.

“It all happened too fast,” said Sinama, who now stays at a local shelter.

“One day I was a normal girl attending school, the next day I was living with an unknown family and an old man who forced me to have sex with him daily.”

“I could not go back home, my grandmother told me never to come back. They sold the cows and got money,” she added.

Now 17, she escaped her tormented married life in July and found solace at Palmerton care centre, which has also become a home to 18 other teenage girls who escaped similar situations.

They were rescued by welfare officials and police in a campaign to stem the practice, even though many communities see nothing wrong with it.

Most of the girls say their abductions were pre-arranged with their parents and left them no say in the process.

In many cases, girls are forced out of school and bear children, when they are barely out of puberty.

“He raped me on our first night together. Every day he forced himself on me, in all the cases he overpowered me after a struggle,” said Sinama, who now has a two-year-old boy by the man.

“I love my child and I am going to raise him to be a good man.”

Captain Nomana Adonis from Mthontsasa police station, which leads a rescue campaign in villages around the area of Lusikisiki, said the abductions were a new phenomenon.

“This is new. We believe there may be hundreds of other girls out there we did not reach,” said Adonis.

“We have encountered girls as young as 13 who were sold to old men, opening them to chances of contracting diseases like HIV.”

She said a number of “husbands” and parents had been arrested.

“In most case the husbands are charged with rape and abduction, but so far we have not secured a single conviction,” said Adonis.

Peter Mtuze, a retired academic and the former head of African Languages at Rhodes University, decried the unothordox revival of ukuthwalwa, saying it did not fit in the modern world.

“Children are literally being sold, almost to the highest bidder. This is paedophilia,” said Mtuze.

“In the old days men usually abducted women who were of marriage age, not minors. This is not culture,” said Mtuze, adding that in the past, girls who were abducted were not raped.

“The girl was kept safe until she accepted the love proposal from the man. Messengers were then sent to the parents of the girl to start lobola (dowry) talks,” said Mtuze.

He said the custom was practised secretly by a number of tribes in African countries.

Both the government of South Africa and the Human Rights Commission (HRC) have condemned the practice, saying it has no place in a modern society.

“This custom is taking us backwards as a country. We are doing our best to stop it and protect the children,” said Phearane Moreroa, head of HRC.—AFP","['Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

Both the government of South Africa and the Human Rights Commission (HRC) have condemned the practice, saying it has no place in a modern society.","['sold', 'man', 'old', 's', 'cows', 'sinama', 'parents', 'forced', 'marriage', 'girls', 'men', 'south', 'practice', 'poverty', 'africa']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd337468dd26.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg', 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}",TRUE,http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'PALMERTON (South Africa) Nolizwi Sinama was 14 years old when her family swapped her for three cows and forced her...', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'http://beta.dawn.com/news/817876/poverty-in-s-africa-three-cows-and-a-forced-marriage', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Poverty in S.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1450509,12/10/18 7:16,"Govt asked to promote girl education, stop child marriage","PESHAWAR: The civil society organisations have demanded of the government to take effective steps to promote girl education and discourage child marriages in the province.

A joint statement of various organisations issued here on Sunday in connection with International Human Rights Day said that according to Unicef report 21 per cent of girls in the country got married before reaching the age of 18.

The organisations including Pakhtunkhwa Civil Society Network, Peace Justice and Youth Organisation, Provincial Alliance to End Early Child and Forced Marriages, Blue Veins, National Action Coordination Group and Partners for Prevention and Response (P4pR) said that civil society and government should work jointly for rights of the vulnerable segments of the society.

The statement also quoted a report of Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), saying the age of 74 per cent of the married girls in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was less than 16 years.

“Child marriage is an appalling violation of human rights and robs girls of their education, health and long-term prospects,” said Qamar Naseem, the programme coordinator of Blue Veins.

Pakhtunkhwa Civil Society Network coordinator Taimur Kamal said that by permitting child marriage, the government was responsible for serious harms suffered by the girls. He said that it required a comprehensive response to stop child marriage. “Having a law that sets a uniform, internationally recognised minimum marriage age of 18 for both boys and girls, is an important aspect,” he said.

District Commission on Status of Women chairperson Shaheen Qureshi said that complications of pregnancy and childbirth were leading causes of death in young women. She said that girls, who married later and delayed pregnancy beyond their adolescence, had more chances to stay healthier and educate and build a better life for themselves and their families.

“To achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), immediate action must be taken to improve access to education and end child marriage,” said the statement.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1472645,3/29/19 21:12,Woman shot dead by brother over 'love marriage' in Karachi: police,"A woman who had contracted a free-will marriage last year was shot dead allegedly by her brother in Karachi's Saeedabad neighbourhood on Friday, police said. Her brother-in-law was killed as well.

The 30-year-old woman was travelling in a rickshaw with her 22-year-old brother-in-law when unidentified pillion riders opened fire on them at Pakistan Chowk in Dawood Goth.

The duo sustained critical bullet injuries and were transported to Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi where doctors pronounced them dead on arrival, according to police surgeon Dr Qarar Ahmed.

Editorial: Murder, not ‘honour’

Both the suspects managed to escape the crime scene.

Station House Officer Irfan Asif told Dawn that the deceased woman had married a man of her own free will in 2018. It was their love marriage and the woman's family did not approve of it.

The officer claimed that the woman's brother along with another suspect carried out the double murder.

The slain woman belonged to the Rind tribe while her husband hails from the Brohi tribe.

According to police, investigators collected four spent bullet casings fired from 9mm and 30-bore pistols from the crime scene.

Meanwhile, Sindh Inspector General of Police Dr Syed Kaleem Imam took notice of the woman and her brother-in-law's murder and sought a detailed report from West SSP Shoukat Ali, a police spokesperson said.","['Imtiaz Ali', 'Gordon D.

ISLAMABAD: ‘Harrassment and threats only strengthened the resolve of women journalists to put truth out there.’

This was the message audience took away from the documentary A Dark Place, screened at Pakistan National Council of Arts (PNCA) on Sunday night.

The film gives a voice to female journalists who have been victims of cyber violence and pays tribute to their resistance. The documentary was the first of such screenings of the annual Human Rights Reel Film Festival hosted by the European Union.

Other partners included the United Nations, 16 EU and UN member states, as well as educational and cultural institutions across Pakistan.

The 10-day Human Rights Reel Film Festival marks 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence. The annual international campaign will close on the Human Rights Day on Dec 10, marking the 71st anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Documentary screened at PNCA gives a voice to journalists who have been victims of online violence

A Dark Place showcased interviews of women journalists across several countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Finland, Turkey and Russia, to mention some. Women journalists in these countries complained about being harassed online with rape and death threats. Despite the humiliation and distress, these women were determined that no amount of harassment would limit their freedom of expression.

“I could relate to every incident and case that these women journalists, in the film shown, faced,” anchorperson Asma Shirazi told audience during the panel discussion that followed on ‘Making the Internet a Safe Place for Journalists’.

“I will not portray myself as a victim. They treat women as weak, emotional, sensitive and fragile, but we are stronger than men, taller and stronger than ever,” she said.

Parliamentary Secretary for Law and Justice Maleeka Ali Bokhari, condemned the harassment of women journalists online.

“When we undermine rights of female journalists to speak freely, then we are eliminating half our country,” she said.

Digital rights activist and human rights lawyer Nighat Dad called for improved implementation of harassment safeguards in the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016.

The film festival is a presentation of 29 award-winning films and documentaries from around the world on human rights issues such as freedom of expression, gender equality, access to justice, minority rights and the death penalty.

The programme showcases diversity of cultures across, films from many different countries, in a variety of languages, yet all distinctly about human rights.

The festival is introducing films for schoolchildren through a new partnership with ‘Girl Rising’ which intends to move beyond university students.

The festival this year will also include a workshop for Pakistani filmmakers to discuss opportunities and challenges faced by the film industry.

Subsequent screenings will be held in 10 cities of Pakistan, including Faisalabad, Gujrat, Islamabad, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, Karachi, Peshawar, Mardan and Quetta at various universities, embassies, Centaurus Cineplex, as well as cultural centres such as Goethe-Institute, and PNCA.

EU Ambassador to Pakistan Androulla Kaminara said that building on past experience, the fifth anniversary of the human rights festival sought to highlight the importance of multilateralism, the universality of human rights and the importance of global cooperation to ensure that protection of human rights and respect for human dignity was a reality for all people everywhere.

“The festival also aims to create cross-cultural understanding and stimulate discussions on global human rights issues with students,” she added.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1239156,2/13/16 6:53,Survivors of gender-based violence tell their stories,"ISLAMABAD: Naila Farhat had acid thrown at her by a suitor her family had refused her hand to. Now, 13 years after the attack in which her face was damaged, Naila is working as an assistant nurse at the Acid Survivors Foundation.

At a ceremony held in connection with National Women’s Day on Friday, Naila said she had taken the attacker to court and made sure he was punished.

The event was hosted by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Aurat Foundation. Many women who had survived violence of one kind or another participated and shared their experiences in a show of solidarity with other women who might be going through the same situation.

A flood survivor from Kashmore, Razia, said she had started her handicraft business to help support her family.

She added that USAID’s Gender Equity Programme (GEP) and the Aurat Foundation had helped her figure out how to start the handicraft business which now employs many other women from her village

“I am now able to not only support my own family, but also others in my village. The whole experience has made me more confident and courageous,” she said.

The ongoing GEP was initiated by USAID and the Aurat Foundation. The five-year project worth $40 million aims to improve women’s access to justice, expand economic opportunities for women, work for their social and political empowerment, support survivors of gender-based violence and help the civil society and the government in preventing, responding to and eliminating gender-based violence.

Another beneficiary of GEP, Azra Bibi, said that through the programme, she had learnt about labour laws and workers’ rights.

“I learnt about how workers could organise themselves to demand their rights,” she added.

American Ambassador David Hale, who was the chief guest at the event, praised the bravery and determination of Pakistani women.

“Investing in women and girls promotes gender equality and has a ripple effect in that it improves all aspects of society. No country can move ahead if it leaves half its population behind,” he said.

He acknowledged the contributions of five ‘women of strength’ towards gender equality in the country. Each of the five women had participated in GEP, which is the largest USAID programme in Pakistan which specifically works for women empowerment.

GEP Head Simi Kamal said the country-wide project had provided hundreds of sub-grants to universities, governments departments and other organisations which worked for women empowerment.

She said women from all walks of life, including those working from home, lawyers, domestic workers and students have benefited from the project.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1375894,12/11/17 6:56,Violence against women persists despite legislation,"Like previous years, the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence Campaign remained in focus across the country as special events and activities were organised in this regard on the government and civil society levels. This international campaign starts from Nov 25, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and ends on Dec 10, the International Human Rights Day.

The representatives of governments and civil society organisations renewed their commitments to strive for the elimination of gender-based violence. Despite claims made by the federal and provincial governments, cases of violence against women continue to persist in the society. During last over a decade the successive governments had been focusing on legislation related to issues of violence against women. While several laws were introduced in this regard, various other laws are in the pipeline in country, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Legal experts believe that there is still a long way to go for implementing the said laws.

In early 2005, the then government enacted the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act (Act No 1 of 2005) to check the inhuman customary practices of honour killing, swara and vani. That law was passed by the Parliament and had appeared in official gazette on Jan 11, 2005. Through that law various amendments were made in the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).

The said amendments for the first time provided definition of honour-related crimes in the PPC, which states: “Offence committed in the name or on the pretext of honour means an offence committed in the name or on the pretext of karo kari, siyah kari or similar other customs or practices.”

Similarly, the inhuman practice of giving females to rival groups in marriages for settling blood feuds was also declared a penal offence punishable with up to 10 years rigorous imprisonment. Subsequently, the Protection of Women (Criminal Laws Amendment) Act, 2006, commonly known as the Women Protection Act was enacted on Nov 30, 2006. Through that law changes were made in the controversial Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979, and adultery and fornication were turned into non-cognisable offences. Now under the law a complaint has to be filed before the concerned court which has to decide to initiate proceedings in the case if sufficient evidence is available.

Two other laws were passed in 2010 aimed at checking harassment of women in public and at workplace. The first law, Criminal law (Amendment) Act, 2010, was passed by the Parliament and given assent by the President of Pakistan on Jan 30, 2010. Through this law amendments were made in Section 509 of Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Schedule II of CrPC.

The amendments made harassment at workplace a penal offence punishable with up to three years imprisonment or with fine of up to Rs500,000. One major objection on this amendment is that the lawmakers have maintained its status as non-cognizable offence and the police had no powers to arrest a person without warrant under the CrPC.

Later the same year, the first exclusive law on the same issue was enacted. The Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, received the assent of the President of Pakistan on Mar 9, 2010. The law provides for appointment of ombudsperson on both federal and provincial levels.

A comprehensive definition of “harassment” is given in this law. Harassment is defined as any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favours or other verbal or written communication or physical conduct of a sexual nature or sexually demeaning attitudes, causing interference with work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, or the attempt to punish the complainant for refusal to comply to such a request or is made a condition for employment.

It is now binding that each organisation shall constitute an inquiry committee within 30 days of the enactment of the law to enquire into complaints of harassment.

Another important legislation was the Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Act, 2011 (Acid Crime Act) which was enacted in Dec 2011. This law is aimed at checking the crime of throwing acid or any other corrosive substance on women.

Previously, there was no specific provision available in the law for checking such like crimes. It provides for maximum sentence of life imprisonment and minimum sentence of up to 14 years imprisonment with fine of Rs1 million for the offence of hurting a person with corrosive substances including acid.

Through this Act certain amendments were made in the Pakistan Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Another law, Criminal law (Third Amendment) Act, 2011, was introduced in Dec 2011. This law introduced certain amendments in the PPC and CrPC. It provides for punishment for depriving women of their share of hereditary property; imposing forced marriage on a woman; and arranging marriage of a woman with Quran. The law is also aimed at checking the practices of swara and vani, or otherwise giving females as badl-e-sulh.

The present government last year passed Criminal Law (Amendment) (Offences in the name or pretext of Honour) Act 2016, through which more amendments were made in PPC and CrPC to prevent honour-related offences.

A major development in 2000 was the setting up of the National Commission on the Status of Women under the NCSW Ordinance 2000. Subsequently, the said ordinance was replaced with the NCSW Act 2012 in which a more elaborate mechanism has now been provided for appointment of the chairperson and members of the commission.

On provincial level, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa took lead from other provinces by setting up the commission in 2010. Later, in 2016 the KP Commission on the Status of Women Act was passed, which replaced the earlier law of 2010.

In connection with the 16 Days of Activism the KP government recently announced formation of district committees on the status of women in 23 of the districts.

Experts say that only the Women Protection Act of 2006 has shown some positive results as previously women prisoners charged for adultery and fornication outnumbered other female prisoners in other offences in the country. They believe that other pro-women laws specially the one dealing with honour-killing failed to achieve the desired results.
