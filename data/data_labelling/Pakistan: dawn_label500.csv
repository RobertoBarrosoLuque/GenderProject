Mahboob Abbasi, who is the victim's father, told Dawn that Akhtar had made telephonic contact with him after the FIR was lodged and protesters had gathered outside the press club.

Abbasi said later Wasim Akhtar along with his son, Taimur Wasim, had visited his residence in Clifton, where MPA Nusrat Abbasi, former bureaucrat Dr Shafqat Abbasi and senior politicians including Syed Ghulam Shah and Asif Baladi were also present.

""The mayor admitted his son's mistake and apologised for his behaviour,"" Abbasi said, adding that ""my son and I have accepted the apology and will withdraw the case filed against Taimur"".

Abbasi said Akhtar, while issuing his apology, insisted that such an incident should never have happened.

An official of the Darakshan police station had earlier told Dawn that the mayor's son, Taimur Wasim, and around eight to 10 others, including his guards, were booked for beating up 19-year-old student, Hasnain Haider, on the night of Dec 31.

The complainant said he was a resident of Clifton who along with his friend was waiting for other friends at a petrol pump in Phase-VIII of DHA when two Vigo vehicles arrived there at around 10pm on Dec 31. Around eight to 10 persons including security guards were travelling in the vehicles. They allegedly resorted to aerial firing, the complainant said, adding that when he inquired about the gunfire and abusive language, they again resorted to firing.

He said that he and his friends left the place in their car but were intercepted by the two Vigo vehicles near Hamza mosque. After stopping their car, the guards who disembarked from their vehicles along with Taimur Wasim told the complainant that he was the son of Karachi Mayor Wasim Akhtar. The complainant said he was beaten up by the guards and Taimur who allegedly used a pistol to hit him. The guards also smashed the windowpanes of the car. They attempted to force him to sit in their vehicle, he claimed, but on the resistance of his friends, the suspects hurled threats and abuse at them before rushing away.","['Imtiaz Ali', 'Tahir A', 'Mateen Mirza', 'Safdar Akbari', 'M.

https://www.dawn.com/news/187466,4/13/06 0:00,Child abuse cases on the rise: report,"ISLAMABAD, April 12: The child abuse ratio in the country is touching the figure of approximately five children a day compared to three a day in 2004.

A report compiled by an NGO, Sahil, from 27 different national and regional newspapers, was shared with the audience on the occasion of ‘Child Friendly Newspaper Award’, here on Wednesday.

The report said 1,719 cases of sexual abuse were reported in the year of 2005 compared to 1,567 in 2004.

Out of the total 1,719 child victims, 422 (25 per cent) are boys while the remaining are girls.

About 1,127 cases occurred in Punjab, followed by 458 in Sindh, 87 in the federal area, 32 in the NWFP and 15 in Balochistan.

The NGO claimed that a large number of cases of sexual abuse went unreported.

The most vulnerable group of children is between the age of 11-15 years both for boys and girls, where 65 per cent of the victims are girls and the remaining are boys.

The report said the girls were at higher risk of being murdered after being assaulted. Therefore, the number of girls was nearly double than that of boys who were murdered after sexual assault.

According to the data, 82 per cent of the girl victims were assaulted for a period ranging from one day to six months, whereas the male child was usually a one time victim.

The research said regarding abuser categories, as it has been found that the victims and their families knew 67 per cent of the abusers.

The ratio of female abetters is the second highest after acquaintance category. In the analysis, it has been found that the number of urban cases has relatively increased from last year’s statistics.

Statistics showed five forms of sexual abuse crimes — abduction for sexual purpose, molestation, rape/sodomy, gang rape/gang sodomy and murder after sexual assault.

Out of the total 1,719, 146 children were murdered after being assaulted, followed by 369 who were gangraped or sodomised, 469 were raped or sodomised, 143 were molested and 565 were abducted with intentions of sexual abuse.

Speaking on the occasion, Minister of State for Information Anisa Zeb Tahirkheli said media had played a vital role in controlling social evils.

She stressed the need to highlight the problems of human rights. There is a pressing need to create awareness among the public regarding child sexual abuse, the state minister added.

Daily Nawa-i-Waqt won the Child Friendly Newspaper award for the category of 50,000 and above circulation. Daily Leader won the award for the category of 20,000 and above circulation, while Daily Insaf won the award for the category of 10,000 and above circulation.","['Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/69147/forced-marriages-among-pakistanis-on-the-rise-report,11/30/02 0:00,Forced marriages among Pakistanis on the rise: report,"LONDONDERRY, Nov 29: The incidents of forced marriage are highest in the Pakistani population in the UK with the Bangladeshis following a close second, a recent report commissioned and launched by the British Foreign Office said.

According to the analytical report of the British Foreign Office, titled “Community Perceptions of Forced Marriage,” the incidents of forced marriage involve both populations, even though most reports of forced marriage have concerned Pakistanis rather than Bangladeshis.

The report investigates the perceptions of forced marriage within the Bengali community in Tower Hamlets and the Pakistani community in Bradford.

The report said the problem of forced marriages is increasing and that this increase is partially explained by the demographic profile of the Pakistani and Bangladeshi community, both very young populations who are reaching marriageable age. Moreover, it said, the problem is compounded by male to female sex ratio imbalance and educated females not finding a suitable match from their communities in the UK.

The report acknowledged that selection of two Muslim communities, to the exclusion of others, could quickly raise the accusation of Islamophobia, religious discrimination and concerns that racial stereotypes are shaping the public debate about forced marriages and the policy initiatives that may emerge.

Defending the reason to select the two Muslim communities, the eport said most of the forced marriage cases handled by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) involve women and men from Pakistan or Bangladesh.

Earlier, in August 2000, the FCO, together with the Home Office, published a Joint Action Plan on forced marriage. Subsequently, a community liaison unit (CLU) was set up in the Human Rights Section of the FCO consular division with particular focus on protecting the human rights of victims and potential victims.

Since October 2000, the CLU has dealt with over 440 cases, and has helped to repatriate 75 young people. Eighty-five per cent of cases involve women victims and 15 per cent male victims, the report said.

According to the report, while the issue of forced marriages is not restricted to a particular racial, ethnic or religious group, it does seem to be more common where the practice of arranged marriage is the norm.

Among South Asians, the report said, practice of parents choosing the spouse is most common among Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, but the practice is now declining and ‘cooperative’-arranged marriages are beginning to become more common among the young. The report said the rates of marriage among Pakistanis and Bangladeshis were comparatively high — 73 per cent and 74 per cent.

Exploring the links between the degree of choice and the class and qualification background of the parents, the report said the practice of ‘traditional’ arranged marriages is strongest among those groups which are least qualified and involved in manual work. Both communities, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, are disproportionately working class and have low human capital in the UK, the report added.

The regional differences of Pakistan are manifested in the population’s marriage patterns in the UK along highly differentiated linguistic, ethnic and clan lines. Strong regional ties differentiated Pakhtoons from Punjabis and from the majority of British Pakistanis, who come from northern Pakistan, specially from the Azad Kashmir district of Mirpur.

“These regional differences map on to the towns and cities of this country since Mirpuris predominate in the Pakistani populations of Bradford and Birmingham, for example, while Faisalabadis [from Punjab] reportedly predominate in Manchester and Glasgow.

The report said the regional differences are compounded by social divisions based on family, kinship ties, caste or caste-like groups and tribe or caste, the report said.

Those who are more likely to reject the arranged marriage option are upwardly mobile, as well as those who have been brought up in the UK, ‘particularly those with higher education and economic independence’. Increasing education among the younger generation of Pakistanis links to a decline of first-cousin marriage among this group.

Conversely, low literacy rates among parents are associated with high levels of consanguineal marriages and hence the reluctance of educated women to contract trans-continental marriages.

The report pointed out that since marriage is conducted between patrilineal subgroups among Pakistanis, this might result in the lack of appropriate choices being available in Britain. Sex asymmetries and differentials in educational qualifications compounded by endogamy mean that there may not be an alternative to conducting a trans-continental marriage.

Citing an example, the report said, 50 per cent of marriages in Bradford are trans-continental in which the partners are selected from Pakistan while in Oxford the proportion of these alliances is estimated to be as high as 71 per cent. The difference between Oxford and Bradford primarily relates to the number of eligible candidates available. The Bradford population is significantly larger than Oxford, therefore finding an appropriate partner within a specific kin group is more difficult in Oxford.","['Arshad Sharif', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

Both communities, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, are disproportionately working class and have low human capital in the UK, the report added.","['uk', 'community', 'cent', 'report', 'forced', 'marriage', 'practice', 'marriages', 'pakistanis', 'rise', 'regional']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd337468dd26.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg', 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}",TRUE,http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'LONDONDERRY, Nov 29: The incidents of forced marriage are highest in the Pakistani population in the UK with the...', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'http://beta.dawn.com/news/69147/forced-marriages-among-pakistanis-on-the-rise-report', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Forced marriages among Pakistanis on the rise: report', 'description': 'LONDONDERRY, Nov 29: The incidents of forced marriage are highest in the Pakistani population in the UK with the...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'http://beta.dawn.com/news/69147/forced-marriages-among-pakistanis-on-the-rise-report', 'title': 'Forced marriages among Pakistanis on the rise: report', 'description': 'LONDONDERRY, Nov 29: The incidents of forced marriage are highest in the Pakistani population in the UK with the...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2002-11-30 00:00:00', 'modified_time': '2002-11-30 00:00:00', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/1017/arshad-sharif'}, 'author': 'Arshad Sharif'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1541497,3/17/20 7:11,"‘My body, my choice’","MANY South Asian men have been unable to come to terms with this slogan — too bad for them. They are fighting a rearguard action because the arc of history has been bending towards equality. In the West, slaves have gained equality as have Jews, while people of colour and women have made significant gains. In South Asia, Dalits continue to advance their rights. Contrary cases of infringement of minority rights invite universal condemnation. So, it is only a matter of time before women effectively obtain the rights that are guaranteed to them under most constitutions.

Objections against the slogan raise interesting issues. Consider the men who protest their support for women, but suggest more appropriate slogans. The irony in doing so is lost on them. This is precisely the suffocating embrace of patriarchy the women are contesting. By subjecting the modalities of struggle to their approval, men deny women the agency that is their right which includes the right to be wrong. Men deciding for women is an anachronism no longer acceptable to many.

But there is a deeper irony at play. This slogan, or at least its essence, was directed first to men. And, more surprisingly, it was not oppressed men raising it against their oppressors. Quite the contrary, it was the oppressors who forced ‘your body, your choice’ upon the oppressed.

Here is the back story. Capitalism, gaining strength in 17th- and 18th-century Europe, had two essential pillars: the sanctity of private property and the free availability of wage labour. Under feudalism, which preceded capitalism, labour was unfree, bound to feudal lords. In order to break this bond, the ideologues of capitalism extended the analogy of private property to the human body. The view was propagated that workers owned their bodies and could do with them what they chose free of the ties that indentured them to feudal lords. Meanwhile, the accompanying Enclo­sure Movement turned all land into private property depriving peasants of sustenance from common holdings. Thus were free labourers created to do with their bodies as they chose. It was another matter that the only choice was to sell their bodies to the highest bidder.

Objections against the slogan raise interesting issues.

There was one positive though unintended outcome of this new enslavement: the emergence of civil rights. The body, now private property, was entitled to the same protection as land or capital. Violating its sanctity became a crime subject to legal redress. And this set into motion a new dynamic in Europe. Once all bodies were acknowledged equal under the law, it was logical to demand an extension to the right to vote. A struggle for political rights ensued, progressively extending the franchise and culminating in universal suffrage; women were the last to be included, as late as the 1940s. Political rights were then leveraged to wrest economic rights like minimum wage, unemployment insurance, and retirement benefits. This journey from civil to economic rights was spread over almost 300 years, and it was not repeated in the same sequence in other parts of the world.

In South Asia, for example, one of the most unequal societies in the world, political rights came first, a consequence of the end of colonial rule. These political rights yielded a modicum of economic rights, most obvious in the case of Dalits in India. But conspicuous by their absence were any semblance of civil rights acknowledging the sanctity and equality of the human body. Dr. Ambedkar noted this straight away when he pointed out soon after Independence that one-person-one-vote could yield one-vote-one-value, but not one-person-one-value. Only a regime of civil rights could ensure the latter.

This brings us full circle to the ferocity encountered by the women’s movement and the underlying threat of interpersonal violence pervasive in South Asia. The infliction of pain on the human body is commonly viewed as a just and effective corrective. This explains popular views that South Asians can only be ruled by the stick, that suspects ought to be beaten till they confess, or that unpopular leaders should be strung upside down or lined up against a wall and shot. It is in this milieu that men could be slapped and women thrashed, or spat upon, or shamed to be taught a lesson with no consequences whatsoever.

We are far from the day when opposing views can be engaged with in a civil manner without threat of violence. The women’s movement, if only for highlighting this issue, is playing a salutary role in dragging us into a more civilised future.

Finally, one should not minimise the perils of translation. The body is just a body in the West. In South Asia, men, and many women, divest it of its vestments. The road to the future passes over rocky cultural terrain on which Neanderthals not only continue to roam, but are often invited to grace the insides of TV studios.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1206329,9/11/15 17:20,A 7-step guide for Pakistani victims of hacking and blackmail,"Pakistan has the highest teledensity (75 per cent) in the region and the cheapest rates for radio internet to have ever been offered (3G/4G LTE Data Plans for as low as $5/10GB). With over 40 million smartphone users, a very healthy chunk of the population is virtually online.

On the one hand, this is indeed a good omen, but on other, it also provides the rotten ones among us with easy and swift access to high speed internet, thus enabling them to carry out their activities with ease and impunity.

And as always, it is largely women who are at the receiving end.

If mobility and other restrictions weren’t enough, online space too, is now gradually becoming a forbidden entity for Pakistani women; in fact, to some extent, it has already.

The modus operandi of the proverbial rotten bunch is pretty basic – they set up multiple digital identities that allow them to collect personal information, mainly of women, in order to harass them online and in the real world.

A growing grey-to-black market of cheap and accessible software and hardware, furthermore, allows anyone to infiltrate mobile devices and computers, in order to track someone's social movements.

Needless to say, this places people, especially women, at great risk.

7 measures you can take to protect yourself

Here are the seven of the most efficient practices that a user should follow to a) avoid chances of harassment through the use of personal data, and b) take appropriate counteraction in case of being harassed online.

1. Choose strong passwords and change them regularly

Never discount the importance of password strength. Also, enable a two-step verification on all the online platforms that offer this feature (Facebook, Twitter and Gmail do); it serves as a crucial second line of defense in saving your online accounts if the hacker has successfully cracked your password.

As soon as you feel someone has used your account, change the passwords for all your accounts, not just the one that was hacked. Otherwise, it’s very easy for the hacker to follow a password pattern and get into your other accounts as well. You can somewhat avoid this by having very different passwords for each account.

2. Report to the authorities immediately

Once you have changed the passwords, report the hacking of your account to the relevant site. If you are unable to get back the control of your account, this will become even more important. All the larger websites normally do respond swiftly.

3. Alert family and friends

After reporting, it may take the site a little time before you get a response. Try to contact your family and friends to let them know of this occurrence so that they don’t communicate with your hacked account.

It is very Important to inform your family members, including your parents and guardians, of this, especially if you believe things could go awry later on. Having your family’s confidence before things take the wrong turn is crucial.

4. Do not cede to the blackmailer's demands

If the harassment has turned into blackmailing and the hacker is demanding money or anything else in return of your private data, do not hand over the money. Do not give in.

There is a high probability that they will try to blackmail you again, and you can never be sure that they have deleted all the copies of your private data.

5. Report the harassment to FIA — they are highly active

In case of cyber harassment or blackmailing, report to Federal Investigation Agency’s National Response Centre for Cybercrime. You will need to give them your details, as the NR3C doesn’t accept anonymous reports for obvious reasons.

This is a must, as you would want to have an official complaint lodged against the criminal. FIA’s NR3C department is very active and prompt in dealing with such cyber crimes, and will possibly be the best agency that can help. [FIA's helpline: 9911]

5.1 In case you are a minor, ask your guardian to lodge the complaint on your behalf. You can also get help from friends or teachers who can lodge a report on your behalf, if you don’t want to involve your family. 5.2 Remember, reporting the crime isn’t only important to safeguard yourself against future harassment – it will ensure that no one else is subjected to the troubles you endured. 5.3 You can report the cyber crime by either filling the online form or sending them an email with all the required information along with the evidence of harassment (screenshots of conversation or logs of e-mails) to this e-mail ID: Helpdesk@Nr3c.Gov.Pk 5.4 It is also important to note that threatening calls do not come under the mandate of Nr3c. To address this issue, one needs to lodge a complaint to your nearest police station.

6. If your friend is a victim, extend support

For peers of the victim, it is essential to support the victim of cyber crimes, as most don’t receive support from their family while going through the trauma of cyber harassment.

For the victim: if you cannot take your family in confidence in case of blackmailing, contact your friends or anyone else in your support system. You will probably find someone who will be able to help you with correct guidance and support.

7. Try to locate the attacker if possible

Family and peers also need to help the victim reach out to the authorities of the university, college, workplace, or any other institution which you think the attacker belongs to. As victims are usually terrified in these situations, it is important for peers and the family to take charge and report to any official agencies and places where the hacker(s) works at, if known.

In case you need further information or assistance, you can always refer to the Hamara Internet website. It has a knowledge base on how to deal with online harassment.

Hamara Internet is part of a Pakistani campaign initiated by the Digital Rights Foundation, which aims to protect Pakistani women against cyber harassment and promote a better understanding of using secure internet and mobile technologies.

The lack of support and a belief that they will be unsafe if they speak out, impacts the already small portion of the female Pakistani population that has access to the internet, as families will often try to restrict further access, once these cases are reported.

Access to the internet has become vitally important for women, not just in Pakistan but around the world, as a means of expressing themselves freely, and to also seek out educational and economic opportunities.

To deny or discourage Pakistani women from gaining access to the empowering platform of the internet is something that the country cannot afford. It is essential that the government and civil society work together to raise awareness about digital security amongst the general populace, with a focus on strengthening the legal support framework against cyber-crime.

However, rather than implementing vaguely-defined legislation with lots of loopholes and room for abuse; and that can see minors as young as 10 years old being prosecuted, the government and civil society must work on massive awareness initiatives and legal remedies that are proactive and provide safety, support and confidence to victims.

The capacity to tackle and solve the problem of cyber-crime and cyber-harassment in all their forms must be built upon strong foundations, if we are to deal with cyber-crimes in their infancy.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1590001,11/12/20 16:02,"Rape of woman, minor daughter in Sindh's Kashmore causes outrage","A man was arrested for allegedly subjecting a woman and her minor daughter to rape for two days after duping the former with a job offer in northern Sindh's Kashmore district, police said on Thursday.

Police arrested the suspect using a trap while an accomplice is currently at large.

Kashmore Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Amjad Ali Shaikh confirmed the suspect's arrest. He said the woman and her daughter were medically examined and their samples were now being sent for forensic and DNA examinations.

Both the victims hail from Karachi, according to Kashmore police. The woman had come across the suspect at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) in Karachi nearly a week ago. The suspect ""promised the woman that he would get her a job at Kashmore Toll Plaza and she readily agreed,” a policeman said.

The woman arrived in Kashmore over the past weekend and met the suspect. Two days later, she approached Kashmore police, alleging that the suspect had raped her after she reached his residence, and he then handed her over to another man living near the Sindh-Balochistan border. That man also allegedly raped the woman, according to SSP Shaikh.

The woman told police that the suspect held her five-year-old daughter hostage, saying he would only let her go when she brought him another woman from Karachi. According to police, the suspect also gave her some money to cover her travelling expenses.

Kashmore police then devised a ploy to nab the suspect.

“Our ASI (assistant sub-inspector) Mohammad Bux Buriro persuaded his wife to talk to the suspect over phone which she did. Then the woman from Karachi and the ASI’s daughter waited in a park in Kashmore where the suspect was scheduled to meet them,” said Kashmore Station House Officer (SHO) Akbar Channa.

As soon as the suspect arrived there, police apprehended him, according to the SSP. He then led police to a cattle pen where he had kept the young girl. “The girl told police that he had subjected her to criminal assault,” the police officer said.

He explained that the trap was arranged and police needed a woman for this purpose so the suspect would be tricked into thinking the victim had brought another woman as he had desired. “Otherwise it would have been difficult to lay hands on him,” he said.

Police conducted raids for the arrest of the other man in Balochistan but he remained at large. A local court has already remanded the Kashmore suspect in police custody for three days.

A case was registered against the two men on Tuesday on the complaint of Kashmore police under under Sections 376 (punishment of rape), 344 (wrongful confinement for ten or more days), 420 (cheating) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code. Besides the two suspects, one unidentified person was also nominated in the case by police.

SHO Channa said the samples of the woman and her daughter were being sent for DNA and forensic analysis.

The DNA samples and clothes will be examined at the Forensic and Molecular Sciences laboratory of the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences in Jamshoro.

'Bestial mindset'

The latest incident involving sexual violence against women and children sparked outrage on social media and was condemned by rights activists and politicians as well. It remained one of the top trends on Twitter in Pakistan and was being posted about with the hashtag 'Kashmore tragedy'.

Comments on Facebook eulogised ASI Buriro for involving his daughter in order to trap the suspect in the case. His photo was also shared on social media to acknowledge his effort.

The minor girl and her mother have been shifted to Larkana, the divisional headquarters in upper Sindh. Larkana district has a tertiary hospital as well where the girl might be kept for treatment, officials said.

PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari issued a statement saying he had taken strong notice of ""the brutal incident"", which had ""shocked him personally and the beasts involved in this gruesome crime have shamed humanity"".

Bilawal said the victims will get justice at any cost and asked the Sindh government to ensure that the culprits get exemplary punishment under the law. He also asked the government to ensure adequate medical treatment for both the victims.

Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari said the ""horrific Kashmore rape case shows how despite laws a bestial mindset continues to ravage our society, violating our children. [...] Sindh government must ensure strict enforcement of law.""

Sindh Governor Imran Ismail termed the incident ""sickening"". He said he was following the case ""to ensure strictest punishment for the criminals"" and the best medical treatment and post-trauma care for the child.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1557803,5/17/20 21:06,Two men arrested for killing 2 teenage girls for 'honour' in Waziristan village,"North Waziristan police on Sunday arrested two men for their alleged involvement in the ""honour killing"" of two teenage girls after a short mobile video of them with a young man surfaced on social media.

The Razmak police station in North Waziristan, in whose jurisdiction the murders were reported, on Friday had registered an FIR of the incident with the state as the complainant and had started an investigation.

According to the FIR, the incident had taken place on May 14 around 2pm at Shaam Plain Garyom, a border village of North and South Waziristan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

""A confirmed report was received that two girls aged 16 and 18 were killed in the name of honour by their paternal cousin, whose name and address is not known, in Shaam Plain Garyom,"" the FIR had said.

It had added that the reason behind the killings was believed to be a video which showed a young man recording himself with three young girls in a secluded area outdoors.

""The arrests were made during a raid at a far-flung area in the jurisdiction of Razmak police station,"" an official told Dawn.com today, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

The suspects are related to the victims; one is the father of the first girl while the other is the brother of the second girl, he said, adding that the culprits have been shifted to Razmak police station.

""Initial investigations show that the suspects opened fire on the victims over the video scandal,"" the official said. Further investigations are under way, he added.

According to the official, both the suspects told police that the victims were killed and buried in their native village.

""The suspects will be presented before a judge for their judicial remand,"" the official added.

Another police official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told Dawn.com that North and South Waziristan police were conducting a joint investigation. ""However, at this point officials are clueless about the third girl and the man who recorded the mobile video,"" he said.

On Saturday, a senior police officer in Waziristan had confirmed the incident and said that two of the three girls seen in the 52-second mobile clip had been killed. He had said that police were collecting information about the third girl and the man seen in the video.

The official had said that the video in question was shot nearly a year ago and most probably went viral on social media a few weeks ago.

“As per the information received by police so far, the third girl and the boy are alive,” the officer had said while quoting a report by the area tehsildar.

“At the moment, our topmost priority is to secure the life of the third girl and the man before taking any action,"" he had added.","['Jai Moolchandani', 'Paggri Sambhal', 'S.

The words ‘torture’ and ‘police’ are inexorably linked in the Pakistani imagination. Not only is torture the primary interrogative technique of the police, whereby they brutalise their victims into confessing whatever they are seeking to prove, it is also openly wielded as a tactic of intimidation and punishment.

Yet, there is no comprehensive anti-torture legislation that defines and criminalises the act, despite a nominal constitutional prohibition.

Though police torture often makes its way to the public as a news item, human rights reports, viral videos or as a punchline of jokes, its fundamental quality is its secrecy. At once, the police’s propensity for torture exists as an amorphous social fact, yet remains inscrutable and unacknowledged in the judicial process.

While activists and journalists try their best to lift the veil on torture, the state has hitherto been reluctant to openly accept its existence and take concrete action. For instance, in its reports regarding the country’s compliance with the human rights treaties it has ratified, the state obfuscates the reality of torture and makes it seem like torture is effectively prohibited and prevented.

Any official inquiry on torture, with findings made public, historically has remained elusive. This dubious distinction, fortunately, has now ended with the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) publishing a landmark report on its year-long inquiry on systematic torture by police in Faisalabad from 2006 to 2012.

The NCHR’s groundbreaking inquiry was made on the back of a complaint filed by Justice Project Pakistan (JPP), based on the data the organisation gathered from Faisalabad in the form of over 1,800 medico-legal certificates (MLC) of victims of torture compiled by the District Standing Medical Board (DSMB).

The DSMB had carried out these examinations on court orders and had found conclusive proof of torture in at least 1,424 cases.

The NCHR’s position allowed it to call in police officials, victims and independent experts to give their testimonies on some selected cases and ask for follow-up proceedings. Based on this, the NCHR concluded that the Faisalabad police had indeed systematically committed torture.

Unsurprisingly, in the 19 cases that the NCHR chose to follow up on, it was found that no police officer involved was prosecuted because, as obliquely written in official replies, the cases were dropped due to either ‘compromise’ or nonpursual by victims.

As the chairman of the NCHR, Justice (retd) Ali Nawaz Chowhan, notes in the report, these ‘compromises’ are unacceptable as they underline how the police uses their oppressive capacity to force an early closure, belaying the cases’ status as gross human rights violation requiring redressal.

The lack of any follow-up action in cases where the DSMB found sufficient evidence indicating torture is a devastating indictment of the impunity with which the police continue to torture.

To have an MLC made is itself a herculean task for the victims of torture, as, in a cruel twist, the victim has to file a complaint of torture with the same police it is accusing of torture and then pursue a case in the courts and win an order to have a medical exam conducted.

At every step, the victim of torture is discouraged from coming forward and thus it is safe to assume that most torture cases remain unexamined.

But then, as the NCHR inquiry shows, even if a victim is successful in proving torture, the perpetrators go unpunished and unquestioned.

The primacy afforded to MLCs should also be questioned as this is the result of judicial evidentiary protocols that disregard the victim’s testimony of suffering and overemphasise the supposed scientific objectiveness of the laid out medical procedure.

By making the body of the victim the only reliable witness in the case against the torturers, police have been encouraged to develop techniques of torture that ensure the body of the victim is unable to provide definitive judicial proof.

Despite the overall insufficiency of MLCs to truly depict the extent of torture’s ghastliness, the findings read like a twisted work of the horror genre.

The victims, who range from as young as 12 to as old as 90 and represent all genders, were subjected to sadistic practices like being tied to two separate beds and being stretched until breaking point or being suspended while being weighed down or to being sexually and psychologically assaulted in various barbaric ways.

The details are simply mind numbing.

Lest anyone claim otherwise, this situation is of course not unique to Faisalabad but a systemic crisis that has existed in Pakistan across time. To show that torture by police follows an organisational logic and is its modus operandi, JPP has compared the Faisalabad data set of 1,867 cases from 2006-12 to a similar data set of MLCs from Lahore of 1,820 cases from 1998 to 2002.

The comparison reveals remarkable consistency in how the Punjab police carries out torture and what kinds of people it routinely victimises.

In addition to the kinds and frequency of injuries being quite similar, in both instances the victims were almost exclusively from underprivileged backgrounds, working as daily wage labourers, farmers, household help or drivers.

While a majority of victims were men, the eight per cent of women in both samples were primarily targeted with sexual forms of torture and their trauma and humiliation was used as a means to psychologically torture their male family members. This level of assault on women’s bodies reveals a deep and sickening cultural malaise in the police force.

Furthermore, one can pick up any anecdotal report from any time in Pakistan’s history, like for example an Amnesty International report from the 1993 and read about the exact same horrific practices and methods of police torture as those uncovered in the NCHR inquiry in 2018.

It should morally offend every Pakistani official that such heinous acts happen regularly in the name of law. The NCHR must be lauded for its efforts to investigate torture and for promising to not let this issue slide. The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government would be well advised to look to this report and follow the judicious and comprehensive recommendations made by the NCHR.

These recommendations include formulating and enacting a comprehensive anti-torture law that defines torture in line with the Convention Against Torture and underline punishments in no uncertain terms, including jail time and removal from status as a government official for any culprit.

Secondly, it is imperative to have an independent body in charge of investigating allegations of torture as law enforcement agencies are not impartial actors in these incidences.

More broadly, it is highly necessary to recognise the factors that have contributed to the police developing an organisational culture of torture and address them.

These factors include structural constraints like improper training and lack of investigative resources as well as being an ongoing legacy of the police’s colonial origins as a repressive force.

The practice of torture is so universally condemned that the prohibition on it is considered a fundamental international norm. It is important to keep in mind that international norms are our shared human values and the state of Pakistan owes it to its citizens to protect them.

The inability or unwillingness to combat the malaise of torture is a permanent stain on the capacity of the state to provide its citizens a fair and just society.

For too long, torture has been conceived and tolerated as an acceptable and inevitable mode of policing and investigation in Pakistan. It is time to eradicate it once and for all.

Representatives of the government have already promised to reform the police with a mind to combat torture. Thus, their first goal should be to expedite the passage of the comprehensive anti-torture legislation pending in parliament for over five years.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1581212,9/23/20 13:33,Police arrest journalist outside IHC,"Islamabad police on Wednesday arrested a reporter who had arrived at the high court to cover a hearing of an appeal filed by Maryam Nawaz against her conviction in the Avenfield corruption reference.

Ehtisham Kiyani, who works for Channel 24, was arrested by police officials deployed for security and was shifted to Ramna police station. He was stopped at a police checkpoint outside the court where he introduced himself but was detained by officials. After arresting him, police claimed that Kiyani was carrying weapons.

Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Athar Minallah took notice of the incident and summoned high-ranking officials of the capital police and ordered Kiyani's immediate release. The reporter was released soon after and Superintendent of Police Sarfaraz Virk said that no weapons had been recovered from Kiyani, adding that a private TV channel had reported ""fake news"".

Speaking to reporters after his release, Kiyani said that he was falsely accused of bearing weapons. He added that he was detained by police for over an hour, during which he was ""tortured"" and ""harassed"".

""I was mistreated by SP Zubair Sheikh,"" he said. Kiyani further said that police took away his mobile phone and wallet. Despite multiple requests, he was not allowed to contact his family or his office colleagues, Kiyani told reporters.

He said that police's attitude with journalists was ""insulting"" and demanded Islamabad's inspector general to take notice of the treatment meted out to media personnel by law enforcement officials.

The journalist's arrest was also condemned by PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb, who termed the incident ""condemnable, regrettable and shameful"".

""Stopping the media from performing its professional duties is unconstitutional and against media freedom,"" she said while speaking to reporters outside the court.

""Selected government's fascism and dictatorship is trampling upon the Constitution, law, democracy and civilian's freedom,"" she added and demanded that those responsible for ""torturing media"" personnel should face legal action.","['Tahir Naseer', 'Babar Azam', 'Dr. Salaria', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Images Staff', 'Khurram Husain', 'F.S.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1522984,12/18/19 15:11,Police arrest muezzin over alleged sexual assault of minor boy in Muzaffargarh,"Police arrested a man on Tuesday for allegedly sexually assaulting a minor boy in Muzaffargarh.

A First Information Report (FIR), dated December 17, was registered on the complaint of the victim's father at Sethpur station under Section 377 (unnatural offence) of the Pakistan Penal Code.

As per the FIR, the complainant's son went to a nearby mosque inside a shrine to study the Quran at around 6:30am. However, unusually, he returned early crying and told his father and others about the incident that had taken place.

According to the FIR, the suspect visited the mosque daily to offer prayers and is also a muezzin (who leads the call to prayer).

The report said that the suspect took the boy outside of the Tadrees-e-Quran room into the Darbar Sharif, where he allegedly assaulted him. The suspect also gave the victim Rs10 in an attempt to silence him but the victim refused and ran home.

Sethpur Station House Officer Malik Sharif Malana said that police arrested the suspect as soon as they received information of the incident and registered a case.","['Mohammad Ali', 'N Khan', 'F K Y', 'Shazad Khalid', 'Habib A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1375894,12/11/17 6:56,Violence against women persists despite legislation,"Like previous years, the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence Campaign remained in focus across the country as special events and activities were organised in this regard on the government and civil society levels. This international campaign starts from Nov 25, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and ends on Dec 10, the International Human Rights Day.

The representatives of governments and civil society organisations renewed their commitments to strive for the elimination of gender-based violence. Despite claims made by the federal and provincial governments, cases of violence against women continue to persist in the society. During last over a decade the successive governments had been focusing on legislation related to issues of violence against women. While several laws were introduced in this regard, various other laws are in the pipeline in country, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Legal experts believe that there is still a long way to go for implementing the said laws.

In early 2005, the then government enacted the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act (Act No 1 of 2005) to check the inhuman customary practices of honour killing, swara and vani. That law was passed by the Parliament and had appeared in official gazette on Jan 11, 2005. Through that law various amendments were made in the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).

The said amendments for the first time provided definition of honour-related crimes in the PPC, which states: “Offence committed in the name or on the pretext of honour means an offence committed in the name or on the pretext of karo kari, siyah kari or similar other customs or practices.”

Similarly, the inhuman practice of giving females to rival groups in marriages for settling blood feuds was also declared a penal offence punishable with up to 10 years rigorous imprisonment. Subsequently, the Protection of Women (Criminal Laws Amendment) Act, 2006, commonly known as the Women Protection Act was enacted on Nov 30, 2006. Through that law changes were made in the controversial Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979, and adultery and fornication were turned into non-cognisable offences. Now under the law a complaint has to be filed before the concerned court which has to decide to initiate proceedings in the case if sufficient evidence is available.

Two other laws were passed in 2010 aimed at checking harassment of women in public and at workplace. The first law, Criminal law (Amendment) Act, 2010, was passed by the Parliament and given assent by the President of Pakistan on Jan 30, 2010. Through this law amendments were made in Section 509 of Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Schedule II of CrPC.

The amendments made harassment at workplace a penal offence punishable with up to three years imprisonment or with fine of up to Rs500,000. One major objection on this amendment is that the lawmakers have maintained its status as non-cognizable offence and the police had no powers to arrest a person without warrant under the CrPC.

Later the same year, the first exclusive law on the same issue was enacted. The Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, received the assent of the President of Pakistan on Mar 9, 2010. The law provides for appointment of ombudsperson on both federal and provincial levels.

A comprehensive definition of “harassment” is given in this law. Harassment is defined as any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favours or other verbal or written communication or physical conduct of a sexual nature or sexually demeaning attitudes, causing interference with work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, or the attempt to punish the complainant for refusal to comply to such a request or is made a condition for employment.

It is now binding that each organisation shall constitute an inquiry committee within 30 days of the enactment of the law to enquire into complaints of harassment.

Another important legislation was the Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Act, 2011 (Acid Crime Act) which was enacted in Dec 2011. This law is aimed at checking the crime of throwing acid or any other corrosive substance on women.

Previously, there was no specific provision available in the law for checking such like crimes. It provides for maximum sentence of life imprisonment and minimum sentence of up to 14 years imprisonment with fine of Rs1 million for the offence of hurting a person with corrosive substances including acid.

Through this Act certain amendments were made in the Pakistan Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Another law, Criminal law (Third Amendment) Act, 2011, was introduced in Dec 2011. This law introduced certain amendments in the PPC and CrPC. It provides for punishment for depriving women of their share of hereditary property; imposing forced marriage on a woman; and arranging marriage of a woman with Quran. The law is also aimed at checking the practices of swara and vani, or otherwise giving females as badl-e-sulh.

The present government last year passed Criminal Law (Amendment) (Offences in the name or pretext of Honour) Act 2016, through which more amendments were made in PPC and CrPC to prevent honour-related offences.

A major development in 2000 was the setting up of the National Commission on the Status of Women under the NCSW Ordinance 2000. Subsequently, the said ordinance was replaced with the NCSW Act 2012 in which a more elaborate mechanism has now been provided for appointment of the chairperson and members of the commission.

On provincial level, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa took lead from other provinces by setting up the commission in 2010. Later, in 2016 the KP Commission on the Status of Women Act was passed, which replaced the earlier law of 2010.

In connection with the 16 Days of Activism the KP government recently announced formation of district committees on the status of women in 23 of the districts.

Experts say that only the Women Protection Act of 2006 has shown some positive results as previously women prisoners charged for adultery and fornication outnumbered other female prisoners in other offences in the country. They believe that other pro-women laws specially the one dealing with honour-killing failed to achieve the desired results.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1374502,12/4/17 17:43,"Sindh University student Naila Rind 'committed suicide after exploitation, blackmail': police","According to a judicial probe report investigating the mysterious death of Sindh University (SU) student Naila Rind which was presented in court on Monday, the student allegedly committed suicide following exploitation and blackmail by the accused in the case after the two exchanged photos of an intimate nature.

Rind’s body was found hanging from the ceiling fan of her room in SU’s Marvi Hostel in Jamshoro on January 1, 2017. She was a final-year student of the Sindhi department.

Anis Khaskheli, a lecturer at a school in Jamshoro, was arrested in connection with the case on the basis of the victim's cellphone records. He later received bail in the case.

A division bench of the Sindh High Court Hyderabad circuit, comprising Justice Salahuddin Panhwar and Justice Fahim Ahmed Siddiqui, had ordered a judicial probe into the case earlier this year while hearing a constitutional petition filed by Qirat Fatima and seven others through Ali Ahmed Palh advocate.

The report, submitted in court today by the Hyderabad District and Sessions Judge Amjad Ali Bohio, recorded the statements of the investigation officer (IO) and Senior Superintendent Police (SSP) Tariq Walait, as well as the accused.

SSP Walait told the judge that on the basis of the evidence and statements in the report, the IO believes the compelling cause, or reason, behind Rind's death was deception and blackmailing by the accused.

The judge observed that the accused had initially said that he did not share any photographs with Rind.

However, ""during course of his deposition when he [Khaskheli] was shown his and Naila’s photographs, he had to admit the fact and retracted his earlier statement"", the judge said.

He admitted that photos had been exchanged, but claimed the fact had no connection with her death, the judge added.

The hearing was adjourned until December 12 after the court ordered the copies of the report to be handed over to all concerned parties.","['Mohammad Hussain Khan', 'Images Staff', 'Khurram Husain', 'F.S.

The hearing was adjourned until December 12 after the court ordered the copies of the report to be handed over to all concerned parties.","['judge', 'exploitation', 'statements', 'walait', 'case', 'naila', 'report', 'death', 'rind', 'sindh', 'committed', 'suicide', 'probe', 'blackmail', 'student', 'university', 'court']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189f00b83e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0d52ba8a43.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2015/09/55f2c36d0c725.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d005917e0.jpg?0.8785461548197806', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2017/05/5906c73d833b3.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2017/12/5a25430bf3284.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2017/04/58f5daf09d916.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21824a8678.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189916390d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0ec56aad75.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2015/09/55f2c36d0c725.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd22283a73d3.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fc7833a64a3a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18a3ece187.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/05/5906c73d833b3.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f94d8916a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/04/58f5daf09d916.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f4142e469.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24c3aad888.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24e90196c5.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2017/12/5a25430bf3284.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'SSP tells court IO believes deception and blackmail were the compelling cause behind the mysterious death of Naila Rind.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1374502', 'type': 'article', 'title': ""Sindh University student Naila Rind 'committed suicide after exploitation, blackmail': police"", 'description': 'SSP tells court IO believes deception and blackmail were the compelling cause behind the mysterious death of Naila Rind.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2017/12/5a25430bf3284.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1374502', 'title': ""Sindh University student Naila Rind 'committed suicide after exploitation, blackmail': police"", 'description': 'SSP tells court IO believes deception and blackmail were the compelling cause behind the mysterious death of Naila Rind.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2017/12/5a25430bf3284.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2017-12-04 17:43:15', 'modified_time': '2017-12-04 17:43:15', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/354/mohammad-hussain-khan'}, 'author': 'Mohammad Hussain Khan'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1200715,8/16/15 6:00,Boy or girl? Methods and ethical questions,"Salman and Najma have a two-year-old girl and now the couple hopes for a boy. They are following advices by a fertility consultant to influence the gender of their unborn baby through “natural methods”.

“No medicines,” says Najma. Without much explaining the methods, she says it is more about the timing of ovulation.

Amjad who operates such a business says these methods have been around since the 1950s. He says many who have not researched this method do not believe in this procedure.

“Still I get around five to six families a month,” he says.

There are clinical methods -- IUI and PGD -- too to conceive the desired gender of an unborn baby.

In the IUI method, male and female sperms are separated and the preferred sperm is reinserted into the woman’s body. This can be done in a number of procedures because fertilisation does not always take place as the male sperm or Y sperm is much slower in reaching the ovum while the X sperm or female sperm is fast. Sometimes the Y sperm even dies soon. The success rate for a baby girl therefore is much higher. For a baby boy only the Y sperm is inserted.

The other method is the PGD method which is done in Pakistan too and it requires lots of work.

“The embryo is fertilised in a lab and then the early genetic traits of the embryo are determined,” says Dr Chohan, fertility expert at the Lady Wellington Hospital.

“It’s being practiced in almost all Muslim countries, including both Saudi Arabia and Iran, and is a safe procedure for both mother and child.”

The IUI has an 85 per cent success rate and the PGD a 95 percent success rate.

In Pakistan there are already instances of female infanticide, illegal abortions, and many families regard their daughters as burden.

“In the desire to have a son, families keep producing children,” says Dr Chohan.

“Most of their children are the outcome of unwanted pregnancies because of no contraceptive control.”

He says through choosing the baby’s sex, it is likely that female infanticide will be reduced.

He says: “Many people, especially in rural areas, have inheritance issues and want sons in their family. If they keep producing daughters, either the girls are mistreated or killed, or the man marries again. There is a high chance of over population and domestic violence too because of this.”

The standard male to female ratio in most countries is 100:105. In Pakistan, women make 55 per cent of the population. In Punjab, the ratio according to the Population Welfare Department is exactly 100:107 (male to female).

But if society continues to prefer one sex over the other such as males over females some trouble is expected to arise very soon. With a higher number of males, there will be a higher testosterone level which may increase violence in society, says psychiatrist Dr Sameeha Aleem.

In one area of India, for example, studies have shown that there are so few women that marriages have become an issue. With women being in high demand, this may result in kidnapping of girls as some studies point out has been the situation in China because of the one-child policy.

In the societies like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, people ask for high dowry, says Lukas Werth – a senior instructor of sociology at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, and this may be one reason why families would prefer boys.

Economist Dr Faisal Bari says in society it is apparent which of the sexes are given more importance and preference.

“With girls there is food insecurity and starting at a very micro scale, we can see that boys are fed first and educated too. If this becomes a common practice which it is not, we will see many things that may impact society. For instance we should see how the state spends on education.”

So far medical laws, Dr Chohan says abortion is illegal, except for limited circumstances, there are really no embryo rights specified in the Pakistani law. Because of this, there is nothing that points out if these procedures are unethical or unlawful.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1591257/australian-special-forces-allegedly-killed-39-unarmed-afghans-report,11/19/20 20:05,Australian special forces allegedly killed 39 unarmed Afghans: report,"Australian special forces allegedly killed 39 unarmed prisoners and civilians in Afghanistan, with senior commandos reportedly forcing junior soldiers to kill defenceless captives in order to “blood” them for combat, a four-year investigation found.

Australia said on Thursday that 19 current and former soldiers will be referred for potential criminal prosecution for allegedly killing the 39 Afghan locals.

Detailing the findings of a long-awaited inquiry into the conduct of special forces personnel in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016, Australia's General Angus John Campbell said there was credible information of 39 unlawful killings by 25 Australian Special Forces personnel in 23 separate incidents. All of those kills were outside the “heat of battle”, Campbell said.

“These findings allege the most serious breaches of military conduct and professional values,” Campbell told reporters in Canberra.

“The unlawful killing, of civilians and prisoners is never acceptable.”

The report said the majority of those killed, which included prisoners, farmers and other Afghan locals, were captured when they were killed and therefore protected under international law.

Following the recommendations of the report, Campbell said 19 current and former members of Australia's military will be referred to a soon-to-be appointed special investigator to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to prosecute.

Australia's Minister for Defence Linda Reynolds said last week that Canberra had been advised that local prosecution would negate charges at the International Criminal Court at The Hague.

'Blooding'

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had earlier warned the report would include “difficult and hard news for Australians”, but few expected some of the most shocking revelations.

While the report was heavily redacted, it included allegations that senior special forces personnel ordered the killing of unarmed Afghans.

“There is credible information that junior soldiers were required by their patrol commanders to shoot a prisoner, in order to achieve the soldier's first kill, in a practice that was known as 'blooding',” the report read.

Once a person had been killed, those allegedly responsible would stage a fight scene with foreign weapons or equipment to justify their action, the report concluded.

The actions did not immediately come to light due to what the report concluded was a culture of secrecy and compartmentalisation in which information was kept and controlled within patrols.

The veil of secrecy was a key reason that the allegations took so long to come to light.

Although it has been the subject of rumour, Australia's official investigation only began after the publication of classified documents about alleged war crimes in Afghanistan.

A former military lawyer, David McBride, has been charged with providing the classified papers to the Australian Broadcasting Corp. He admits that he supplied the papers, but says it is in the national interest.

The four-year inquiry was conducted by New South Wales state Judge Paul Brereton, who was appointed by the Inspector-General of Defence in 2016 to investigate rumours of war crimes in Afghanistan between 2003 and 2016.

The inquiry examined more than 20,000 documents and 25,000 images, and interviewed 423 witnesses under oath.

The report recommended Canberra should compensate victims' families even without a successful prosecution.

Campbell said he would seek to revoke citations for special operations task groups that served in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2013.

The release of the report came after Morrison spoke with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.

“The Prime Minister of Australia expressed his deepest sorrow over the misconduct by some Australian troops in Afghanistan,” Ghani's office wrote on Twitter.

Australia has had troops in Afghanistan since 2002 as part of the US-led coalition fighting the Taliban militia.

Australia has about 1,500 troops remaining in Afghanistan.","['Imtiaz Ali Khan', 'Taimoor Khan', 'Dr. Salaria', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Kit Kit', 'Ashraf The Great', 'Hamza Alam', 'Fawad Bhai', 'Zeeshan Ahmed', 'Riffat Rashid']","Australian special forces allegedly killed 39 unarmed prisoners and civilians in Afghanistan, with senior commandos reportedly forcing junior soldiers to kill defenceless captives in order to “blood” them for combat, a four-year investigation found.

The committee meeting was chaired by MNA Chaudhry Mahmood Bashir Virk and was attended by its members and officials of the concerned Ministry of Law and Justice.

The secretary law told committee members that the Ministry of Law, Justice and Human Rights has conducted a series of consultations with the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, the relevant federal ministries, divisions and National Commission on the Status of Women, to finalise a draft for the Hindu Marriage Bill 2014.

He said that the draft is more comprehensive and within constitutional limits while the bill is in accordance with the wishes of the Hindu community.

Virk said that the committee should also invite MNA Dr Ramesh Kumar to finalise a more comprehensive draft of the bill in this regard.

When contacted, PML-N MNA Dr Ramesh Kumar said that he had already discussed the draft of the bill with the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) chairman Maulana Muhammad Khan Sherani. The CII chairman agreed with the contents of the draft bill in this regard, he added.

“It has been suggested in the bill that a Muslim will be unable to marry a Hindu girl within three-and-half years of separation from her husband,” he informed.

The draft bill recommends that National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) should issue computerised marriage registration certificates to Hindu couples.

Meanwhile the minimum requirements to get the certificate will be to submit copies of the CNICs of the groom, bride, and their parents.

It will also be important for Hindu couples to submit a copy of the marriage certificate issued by a pandit or Hindu Council along with a copy of the pandit’s CNIC who solemnised the marriage.","['Irfan Haider', 'Atif Ali', 'Rashid Zaidi', 'Krana Seoul', 'Shahryar Shirazi', 'Taimoor Khan', 'Chander Kolhi', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman']","ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly Standing Committee on Law, Justice and Human Rights on Friday decided to finalise and approve a comprehensive draft regarding the Hindu Marriage Bill 2014 in its next meeting to stop forced marriages of Hindu girls with Muslim men.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1584044,10/9/20 7:15,"Repeated incidents of child abuse warrant greater action from state, society","KARACHI: Another city; another missing child; another garbage heap; another dead body. Same crime: kidnapping, rape and murder.

A five-year-old girl goes missing on September 4, 2020 this time in Karachi. She is kidnapped, raped and murdered and her body found on a garbage heap. This time the body has been torched.

News of this incident spreads via social media and once again ignites protests. People demand justice for this child and others like her.

Crimes against children are increasing in Pakistan. According to Sahil’s — a non-government organisation — cruel numbers, child sexual abuse has increased by 14 per cent.

In the NGO’s Six Months Cruel Numbers Report the number of child abuse cases reported between January to June this year is 1,489 out of which 53pc were girls and 47pc boys and that more than eight children were abused daily during the first six months of the year. According to the report, 32pc of these cases were reported in Sindh.

CM’s law adviser says legislation proposed to create database of habitual offenders

However, the number of cases only includes the ones reported. The actual number is probably higher.

The main reason for this, as Aamna Latif of Aahung, an NGO working to improve sexual and reproductive health and rights said in an email to Dawn, is “The culture of guilt and shame associated with the body that is inculcated in children since a young age (amongst other factors), you would agree that there is under-reporting of sexual abuse, so numbers are actually much higher than this.”

There are laws in Sindh that provide protection to children but lack of awareness and implementation makes them useless. Ms Latif says, “Under the Sindh Child Protection Authority Act 2011, the Sindh Child Protection Authority was established which boasts Child Protection Units in 29 districts of Sindh. They claim to have rescued about 1,000 children all over the province over the last year, and provided legal aid to them via special courts.”

‘Habitual offenders & weakness of justice system’

Recently, Barrister Murtaza Wahab, adviser to the CM on law, expressed grave concern over rising incidents of crimes against children, especially child disappearances and abuse.

Commenting on the matter, Mr Wahab told Dawn: “The real change or effective curb on such crimes will only happen once we have the people accused of such offences convicted. No deterrence can be created without stringent punishment to the wrongdoers. Unfortunately, people involved in such crimes including the ones against women are usually habitual offenders and the recent Motorway incident again shows weakness of our criminal justice system that the person who allegedly committed the act was earlier involved in similar offences.”

Speaking about reforms, Mr Wahab said, “We need reforms for expediting the trial of such cases. Government of Sindh (GoS) wants to push a new law which would have shortened processes and hopefully once passed by Assembly we would require the Courts to implement it.

“Once we have courts deciding these matters fast it would lead to the following: A) deterring the criminals because of fear of conviction; B) having a database of such habitual offenders so that they can be effectively tracked and traced; C) social issues with family being reluctant to report such crimes would also be sorted,” he added.

Mr Wahab thinks that there is a need to “Encourage families to report. Right now the families, due to various reasons, are not encouraged to report such matters. CPA law needs certain amendments which I am taking to the Assembly.”

At present, the Sindh government has a child helpline, 1121.

Speaking about this, Mr Wahab said, “There is a helpline for child issues which is functional but it needs more awareness. Moreover, the 15 mechanism of Sindh police also needs to be used by families as and when any child goes missing.”

But things are being done at a very slow pace which is why some people have begun taking initiative themselves to protect children by creating safe environments for minors.

Tasneem Ashraf, an educationist, teacher trainer and supervisor at a day care centre says: “We are so careful about children’s safety that we tell parents that if the child is going to be picked by a driver, uncle or anyone he will not be allowed to carry the child physically unless the child is under one year.”

Ms Ashraf added that “I take immediate action if I see anyone carry a child who is capable of walking. Once I saw a driver pick a child and carry her to the car. I called the mother and told her that we do not allow children to be carried like this, even if the person is reliable. And she should also make sure this does not happen.”

However people taking up the responsibility is not enough. The government also needs to take responsibility and take steps to make the province safer for children. And also to ensure that laws are easily implemented and speedy action is taken after a crime is committed.

Currently there is a vacuum, as the government is unable or unwilling to do its part to protect children. Fortunately, NGOs have stepped in and are providing information, legal support and even shelters to those who need them. Perhaps the government can get its act together and set up a workable system with help from these organizations by adopting their existing structures.

“Aahung has a referral system where we pass on information to survivors of sexual abuse for them to be able to seek physical, psychological and legal recourse,” Aamna Latif says.

“There are a few civil society organisations who have independent shelter homes for women and children who are victims of abuse. These are, again, not long-term solutions. However, there are no such places of refuge which are government-run. They largely exist on paper — are budgeted for and misallocated.”

The federal and provincial governments can learn from these NGOs.

Recommendations

A good place to begin would be to consider these recommendations given by Aahung.

The state must introduce Child Protection via Life Skills Based Education (LSBE) in all schools with parent education being a critical aspect. Children must be taught in school how to identify and protect themselves from abuse as well as how to respect others and prevent themselves from becoming abusers. School LSBE programmes must also engage and sensitise parents to identify signs of abuse and support their children in feeling safe and confident about reporting abuse.

The state must launch regular mass awareness campaigns through media for parents, law enforcement agencies and healthcare providers to listen to children and support them, an essential social pre-requisite for justice.

The state must establish special police units at the district level with male and female officers trained to deal sensitively with cases of child sexual abuse. Additionally, all police stations need to be equipped with rape kits and forensic lab support within their province.

The state must activate and mobilise their Child Protection Units in every province, and within each province ensure their presence in every district. Child protection institutions (CPIs) practicing alternative family-based care must (a) rescue and protect children, specially survivors of child sexual abuse, when families are not safe and (b) also monitor any institutions interacting with children and hold them accountable as per law.

The state must establish specific child-friendly courts to ensure that child survivors get access to sensitive justice.

The state must invest in ensuring an increase in the number of women in the police force, in the legal profession (as lawyers and prosecutors) and mandate an increase in the number of female judges and female medico-legal officers.

The state must provide free legal aid to survivors of child sexual abuse.

The state must provide free counselling and therapy for survivors of child sexual abuse by specially trained therapists.

The state must mandate hospitals, clinics and health units to provide awareness to and train and sensitise healthcare providers to provide appropriate care to survivors of child sexual abuse.

Finally, the state must establish strong linkages between relevant departments including education, child welfare, police and health, as well as the civil society voices, especially child rights organisations to build a coordinated approach to end violence against children.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1041438,9/8/13 11:10,Indian troops deployed to quell communal clashes,"LUCKNOW: Hundreds of troops were deployed on Sunday to quell deadly clashes between Hindus and Muslims, sparked by the killing of three villagers who had objected to the harrassment of a young woman in northern India.

The two groups charged at each other with guns and knives in Kawal village in the state of Uttar Pradesh.

According to the police, nine people, including an Indian broadcast journalist and a police photographer, were killed in the clashes.

The violence quickly spread to neighboring villages in Muzaffarnagar district on Saturday night.

''A curfew has been imposed in three riot-hit areas of Muzaffarnagar,'' said R.M. Srivastava, who is Head of the state's Home Ministry . ''The situation is still very tense, but under control.''

Indian soldiers went door to door to in search of weapons and a state of high alert was declared for the entire state of Uttar Pradesh, comprising of 200 million people.

The clashes broke out on Saturday after thousands of Hindu farmers held a meeting in Kawal to demand justice for killing of three men who had spoken out when a woman was being verbally harassed.

The state's minority welfare minister, Mohammad Azam Khan, said some at the meeting gave provocative speeches calling for Muslims to be killed.

According to a senior police official Arun Kumar, the farmers were attacked while they were returning home after the meeting.

''The attack seemed well planned,'' said Kumar, adding that some of the attackers were armed with rifles and sharp-edged weapons.

Gunfire was reported from several areas of the village. Within hours clashes broke out in neighboring villages.

A leader from the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party said tensions had been simmering since the three men were killed on August 27 in a tea shop.

''Had the killers been arrested, the situation might not have gone out of hand,'' Vijay Bahadur Pathak said.

Tensions were expected to escalate in the run-up to next year's national elections, Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde told reporters in New Delhi on Saturday. He asked all 28 of India's states to stay alert and improve their ability to gather intelligence.

Uttar Pradesh was at the heart of some of India's worst communal clashes in December 1992, after a Hindu mob razed the 16th century Babri mosque in Ayodhya.

According to Indian media, communal violence last month left two dead and 22 injured in a village in Bihar state, east of Uttar Pradesh.

Outbreaks were also reported recently in Uttar Pradesh's district of Shamli, as well as in the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir.

The government has warned that India is seeing a rise in communal violence, with 451 incidents reported already this year, compared with 410 for all of 2012","['V V S Sarma', 'Zar Khan Wazir', 'Saad Dxb', 'Shams Khan', 'Naeem Gulzar', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar']","The two groups charged at each other with guns and knives in Kawal village in the state of Uttar Pradesh.

The government has warned that India is seeing a rise in communal violence, with 451 incidents reported already this year, compared with 410 for all of 2012","['indian', 'troops', 'uttar', 'state', 'hindu', 'village', 'states', 'woman', 'violence', 'clashes', 'deployed', 'communal', 'quell', 'reported']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2013/09/522c4a4867ca7.gif', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd329902b790.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2013/09/522c0ad592f36.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2013/09/522c0ad592f36.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'http://i.dawn.com/large/2013/09/522c4a4867ca7.gif', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg'}",TRUE,http://i.dawn.com/large/2013/09/522c4a4867ca7.gif,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Nine people, including a broadcast journalist and a police photographer, have been killed in the clashes: police', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'http://www.dawn.com/news/1041438', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Indian troops deployed to quell communal clashes', 'description': 'Nine people, including a broadcast journalist and a police photographer, have been killed in the clashes: police', 'image': 'http://i.dawn.com/large/2013/09/522c4a4867ca7.gif'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'http://www.dawn.com/news/1041438', 'title': 'Indian troops deployed to quell communal clashes', 'description': 'Nine people, including a broadcast journalist and a police photographer, have been killed in the clashes: police', 'image': 'http://i.dawn.com/large/2013/09/522c4a4867ca7.gif'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2013-09-08 11:10:41', 'modified_time': '2013-09-08 15:08:28', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/156/ap'}, 'author': 'AP'})",[],dawn

The webinar named ‘Shelter and Police Response on Gender-Based Violence during Covid-19’ was organised by Rozan (non-profit organisation) in collaboration with United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) on Wednesday.

They also called for improving existing services of shelters and medico-legal aid at provincial level and ensuring hiring of more police personnel.

They also said that capacity building initiatives should be continued for police department for unbiased, non-judgemental and sensitive handling of survivors.

They said a national level awareness campaign should also be launched to disseminate the information regarding services (legal and shelters) available for gender-based violence survivors.

Rozan representative Madeeha Waheed shared Rozan data on crisis case handling, their challenges and learning.

She shared an analysis of the cases during Covid-19 which indicated a huge increase in different forms of violence predominantly domestic violence.

Rozan’s crisis intervention programme dealt with more than a hundred (117) cases from April-August including 72 cases of domestic violence. Survivors were physically, emotionally and economically abused, having security concerns at their own safe space.

Gender specialist from Khyber Paktunkhwa government’s Social Welfare Department Ms Nudrat shared the government’s response to violence cases during the pandemic. She highlighted the importance of women shelters availability during Covid-19.

Lastly, she stressed on the importance of programming and policy making to support women survivors of violence.

She said keeping in mind the increase in gender-based violence cases amid the pandemic, the government had decided to increase the number of shelters and Darul Aman at district level to ensure provision of services to the victims.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1490687,6/27/19 7:09,Dealing with child abuse,"THE abduction, rape and murder of eight-year-old Zainab in Kasur in January 2018 shook the entire nation out of its complacency in such cases. But hopes of a decline in child abuse, even after the hanging of the culprit seven months later, have not been realised.

The figure of 3,445 children who were sexually abused in 2017 has often been mentioned as an annual estimate. A chilling case recently reported involved 10-year-old Farishta. It exposed, in addition to a sex fiend’s brutality, the customary cupidity of the police. This only means that protection of children against sexual abuse, even if they are not killed, must remain high on the national agenda.

The federal government responded with a bill in the National Assembly, The Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Bill, to create an agency to deal with cases of missing children. The Assembly returned the bill to the mover on grounds of its vagueness. There is now a revised version. Vagueness apart, this bill was an extremely shoddy draft. The authors had taken incredible liberties with the English language and preferred verbosity to brevity.

Take the sentence “It is essential to legislate for an institutional response at the level of such areas in the federation as are not included in any province”. It could have been replaced with ‘It is necessary to provide for an institutional response in the federal territory’.

The seriousness of the matter demands that the government take whatever help it can from CSOs.

Besides, the bill is a hodgepodge of provisions only some of which could be part of the law, while many others should be in the rules. The penalty under sections 361-A and 369 of the Penal Code has been increased with the addition of hefty amounts in fine. An annexure lists 49 bits of information about the missing child to be gathered by the organisation. The table would have a better place in the rules because placing it within the law precludes the collection of information not included in it. It should have been put in the rules with the addition of a line ‘And any other information that may be considered necessary’.

Besides, opinion is divided on whether the bill and the agency to be created under it should be named after a victim, because it involves perpetuating the memory of one among the many equally wronged children.

The proposed law and the agency created under it are to be administered by the ‘National Commission on the Rights of the Child’. Where is this commission? If the reference is to the cell in the secretariat of the Wafaqi Mohtasib, that cell, despite the presence of a few dedicated persons, does not have the human and financial resources the task requires.

The seriousness of the matter demands that the government take whatever help it can from civil society organisations. While some of them are monitoring incidents of children’s abduction, rape and murder, we need more investigative studies such as Accountability for Rape: A Case Study of Lodhran, carried out by the University College, Lahore.

Statistics attached to the study show that the police submitted reports on 7,120 rape cases under Section 376 of the Penal Code in Punjab during 2016 and 2017. The number of cases decided was 5,814 and the number of convictions a mere 216 (3.7 per cent only). The districts that reported the highest number of rape incidents (and a poor conviction rate) are: Lahore, where 191 cases out of 418 were decided with three convictions; Rahim Yar Khan, 393 cases, with 370 decided and eight convictions; Bahawalpur, 355 cases with 286 decided and eight convictions; Khanewal, 355 cases, with 243 decided and nine convictions; Lodhran, 310 cases, with 252 decided and 16 convictions; and Faisalabad, 305 cases, with 330* decided and 14 convictions.

The districts reporting the lowest incidence are: Jhelum, 19 cases, with 32* decided and one conviction; Mianwali, 23 cases, with 27* decided and two convictions; Attock, 23 cases, with 36* decided and three convictions; Chakwal, 36 cases, with 34 decided and two convictions; Khushab, 39 cases, with 45* decided and one conviction; and Narowal, 44 cases with 46* decided and six convictions.

[ * The cases decided included some filed earlier than 2016. The total number decided over the two years was 9,154, while there were 7,120 new cases. The victims include small girls and older women, but that doesn’t matter while determining the course of the law.]

Let the experts determine the causes of variation in cases of rape in the Punjab districts. What can be noted at first sight is that the incidence of rape cases could be proportional to the degree of development in a district.

The study offers plenty of food for thought to lawmakers, police and prosecutors regarding the failure to punish rapists. It finds that in 85pc of acquittals the reason was the resiling of witnesses. After a brief review of laws applicable to rape cases, the study points out the causes of the poor conviction rate: a rape case takes on average 560 days to decide as against the stipulated period of 90 days; delayed filing of FIRs; delays in medical examination; inconsistencies in the victim’s statements; conduct of witnesses (relatives and strangers); questionable methods of medical tests; violence; cases of married women; and variations in the age of a minor. Many recommendations have been made and merit serious consideration.

New research should also cover the social factors that contribute to abduction and rape. For instance, what can be done to reduce the population of street children? Will compulsory schooling help? Can improved housing for the poor prevent them from telling their little ones to spend the day in the streets?

A key finding in most rape studies is that children are unusually vulnerable at schools and madressahs and many of the culprits are members of victims’ families or known to them. Stricter control of educational centres and essential sex education for children and their mothers are fundamental to strategies to protect the nation’s precious children from the most horrible cycle of abduction, rape and murder.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1409636,5/24/18 6:55,Forced marriages,"CONTROLLING women’s sexuality to uphold antediluvian notions of family honour is a common motivation for forced marriages that end in violence, rape and even murder.

On Wednesday in a landmark judgement, a British court found a mother guilty of deceiving her teenage daughter into travelling to Pakistan and forcing her to marry a much older man.

Even more horrific was that the man in question was the same maternal relative who had raped her on a previous visit to Pakistan.

Only aged 13 at the time, she had to undergo an abortion to terminate the resultant pregnancy.

The verdict finally sends a strong message that victims’ voices will be heard and that there are consequences for those who coerce them into marriage.

Despite a 2014 law criminalising forced marriages in the UK (even those conducted abroad involving British nationals), few cases are reported.

This is attributed to complex, patriarchal family structures that traverse countries, and make it difficult to seek help if the upshot is that parents could go to jail.

Because many girls from diaspora communities are taken abroad during school vacations to get married, teachers and even airport staff are instructed to watch out for signs of distress.

The fear is real.

Refusal to obey parents in such matters can attract the ultimate retribution.

The recent murder of Sana Cheema, an Italian-Pakistani tricked by her family into travelling to Pakistan to be married, is a case in point.

According to the UK’s Forced Marriage Unit, Pakistan, with 439 cases, ranked the highest among the top four ‘focus’ countries in 2017, followed by Bangladesh, Somalia and India.

The adherence to such oppressive practices is linked partly with the high prevalence of arranged marriages among second and third generation Asian immigrants with spouses from their country of origin.

This trend has encouraged ghettoisation and impeded integration for decades.

Coupled with poor employment prospects, a lack of language skills and education among immigrants — especially among Pakistanis and Bangladeshis who come to the UK through such arranged marriages — the result is further socioeconomic isolation from the mainstream.

Clearly, instituting strategies to foster multiculturalism is essential but the British government must do more to address the underlying reasons that perpetuate imported misogynistic practices.

A forced marriage is not a cultural matter but a criminal offence that must be investigated, even if collaboration from other governments is necessary, so that those at risk are protected.

Despite a 2014 law criminalising forced marriages in the UK (even those conducted abroad involving British nationals), few cases are reported.
According to the UK’s Forced Marriage Unit, Pakistan, with 439 cases, ranked the highest among the top four ‘focus’ countries in 2017, followed by Bangladesh, Somalia and India.
The adherence to such oppressive practices is linked partly with the high prevalence of arranged marriages among second and third generation Asian immigrants with spouses from their country of origin.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1588524/forced-conversion,11/4/20 7:23,Forced conversion,"AN important case is being heard at the Sindh High Court, one that has a critical bearing on the rights of minorities, particularly the thorny question of religious conversion when it goes hand in hand with underage marriage.

A Christian girl named Arzoo recently sought a court injunction to prevent the registration of a kidnapping case against a man with whom she had undergone a nikah ceremony, and his family. She had claimed in an affidavit that she was 18 years of age and was ‘marrying’ him after converting to Islam of her own free will.

However, apparently incontrovertible documentary evidence has emerged that shows Arzoo is a 13-year-old child. On Monday night, the police said they had arrested the purported ‘husband’, recovered the girl and were moving her to a shelter home for three days as ordered by the court.

There have been many incidents over the past few years in which families of girls from minority communities, usually Hindus living in interior Sindh, have alleged that their daughters were forcibly converted before being married to Muslim men. More often than not, the ‘brides’ are underage girls.

According to the law, the minimum age for marriage in Sindh is 18 years; there are no exceptions or mitigating circumstances. The Child Marriages Restraint Act mandates prison terms and fines for the male contracting party as well as those who perform the nikah or in any way facilitate such a union.

The problem seems to arise, however, when religious conversion is involved. At present there is no law providing for a minimum age of conversion. In 2016, a bill was introduced in the Sindh Assembly stipulating 18 years as the minimum age for such a profound, life-changing decision.

But when the religious lobby created a furore, the PPP government shamefully capitulated and the law was never enacted, leaving this critical issue concerning the minorities’ fundamental rights far from settled, and dependent on a case-by-case interpretation.

Almost always thus far, despite the law on underage marriage, the courts have been inclined to look the other way if the girl claims her conversion was according to her will, and allowed her to go with her purported spouse. The inequality of social and political power between the two parties is an important factor in this pattern, as is the pressure exerted in an atmosphere of growing religiosity, where true free will in matters of faith scarcely exists.

Police said they had found the body of an unidentified woman in the Chutala precincts of Jhelum on May 10. The deceased was later identified as Arooj Shahzad, wife of Shahzad Ahmad of Lahore, who had reportedly fled her home and reached Hadala Syedan village near Dina city.

The woman had filed an application with the Dina police on May 9, stating that she had taken refuge at the house of her friend, Nida, after fleeing from Lahore since her brother Al-Umar, son Usama Shahzad and her husband’s brother Muhammad Waseem wanted to kill her.

The police said they had produced the woman before the senior civil judge Jhelum and she told the judge that she wanted to go with Nida and two other persons, Zain Shah and Farasat Abbas, of the same village. At this, the judge sent her with them. The relationship of Nida with other persons could not be confirmed.

Later, Zain Shah and Farasat Abbas handed Arooj over to her brother Al-Umar, son and a brother-in-law who allegedly shot her dead, threw her body in a deserted area and fled.

Chutala police registered a case against five suspects, including her alleged killers and also those who had handed her over to her family.

The case has been registered under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) on the report of Assistant Sub-Inspector Malik Sajjad of Dina police.

Investigation officer Abdul Rehman told Dawn by telephone that the body of Arooj had been handed over to the Masood Butt Welfare Trust, Jhelum, for burial after autopsy at the Jhelum District Headquarters Hospital. The officer said the deceased was in alleged relationship with Farasat Abbas who had been arrested.

2017-04-21

THIS refers to media reports (April 8) wherein a woman ingested rat poison because she felt she could not get justice, leading to the death of her unborn child, possibly conceived during her rape.



It is time we clarified things about abortion in Pakistan. I personally believe a woman should have the legal right to an abortionif(a)sheisraped and thefetusis conceived owing to rape; (b) in cases of incest; (c) where the mother`s life is in danger if the pregnancy is carried to term; and (d) if the fetus appears deformed.



No one should have to ingest rat poison to kill a fetus, whose birth and whose life will be a daily reminder of a rape. The US has abortion on demand, with restrictions for minors who need to see a judge acting aslegalguardianifthe parents cannotbe approached by the child.



While I morally oppose abortion in my own family, I am not opposed to abortion by other people in what is obviously a free society, by people who are all accountable before God for their own choices in life.



I will not consider forcing my morality upon anyone else living in a free society.



My own personal view is that abortion is murder. The best argument for the other side is made in the Hollywood movie, Dirtp Dancing, starring Patrick Swayze, for keeping abortion legal.



If women are forced to have illegal abortions, their own lives, future fertility and healthcould be seriously atrisk through unsafe practices relating to illegal abortions. Much better is to have it available in hospitals by qualified doctors.

If women are forced to have illegal abortions, their own lives, future fertility and healthcould be seriously atrisk through unsafe practices relating to illegal abortions.","['illegal', '2017', 'woman', '21', 'poison', 'abortion', 'rape', 'apr', 'fetus', 'rat', 'conceived', 'free', 'life']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://epaper.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://epaper.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://epaper.dawn.com/_img/font-decrease.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://epaper.dawn.com/_img/font-increase.jpg', 'http://epaper.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://epaper.dawn.com/_img/font-reset.jpg'}",TRUE,http://epaper.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg,1,FALSE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Dawn News', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'Dawn Epaper', 'url': 'https://epaper.dawn.com/DetailImage.php?StoryImage=21_04_2017_009_007', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Apr 21, 2017 | Abortion', 'image': 'http://epaper.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://epaper.dawn.com/DetailImage.php?StoryImage=21_04_2017_009_007', 'title': 'Apr 21, 2017 | Abortion', 'image': 'http://epaper.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://epaper.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2017-04-21'}})",[],dawn

Police told journalists that on Sept 21 a resident of Qandeel Bala village in Madyan filed report that his son took his animals for grazing but he was found dead, hanging from a tree.

“My son took his animals for grazing to the nearby fields in the morning but he did not come back till evening. We went after him and a neigbour informed us that my son’s dead body was hanging from a tree,” said SSP Mohammad Nazir while quoting the father of the murdered boy.

He said that police rushed to the spot after registration of the report and collected evidence with the help of which they arrested some people including a prime suspect. During the initial investigation the prime suspect, a relative of the murdered boy, confessed to his crime, he said.

The SSP said that FIR was registered against the accused under section 302, 377, 53CPA and further investigation was underway from him. He said that 86 murder cases were reported by police in the current year and 75 of those were traced while nine other were untraced.

“We traced the culprits in the nine untraced cases and arrested all the accused in the cases,” he said, adding that the three major cases of robbery were also traced in which the culprits were arrested with recoveries.

The official said that unawareness and lack of responsibility on the part of parents were major causes of sexual harassment and violence. He urged parents to take care of their children and fulfill their responsibilities in that regard.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1338445,6/11/17 7:03,THE ICON INTERVIEW: PAKISTAN'S BOY WONDER,"The Pakistani-origin boy wonder Kumail Nanjiani has been making waves in the international media — and for all the right reasons. Since he moved to the United States as a young student, he has rapidly established himself as a comedian, podcast host, actor and writer of repute, and was recently awarded the Comedy Star of the Year Award at CinemaCon Big Screen Achievement Awards held in Las Vegas. What’s more, he has scripted a movie along with his wife Emily V. Gordon for Judd Apatow, the biggest comedy movie producer in Hollywood. Called The Big Sick, the film, due to be released on June 23, also features him as the lead star. Time.com has listed it as one of the most anticipated movies of this summer, so one must hand it to him — he has achieved no small feat in a relatively short time. And just this month he was invited by his alma mater, Grinnell College, Iowa, to give the commen­cement speech to the graduating students of 2017, and was conferred the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters. Looks like he is on a roll this year, and there is no looking back for this star of HBO’s Emmy award-nominated series Silicon Valley, currently in its fifth season of airing.

Catching hold of Nanjiani on email and pinning him down for an interview was not as difficult as I had imagined, and one must admit Nanjiani was forthcoming in his answers, and also, a little brief. Perhaps like all great writers and comedians he feels brevity is the soul of wit. Here is what this amazingly talented youngster had to share with Icon:

Award-winning stand-up comic Kumail Nanjiani turns to film with The Big Sick

Q. Did you ever act, write, host or do anything similar while you lived in Pakistan?

Kumail Nanjiani: No, I didn’t.

Q. When did you realise you have a talent for comedy?

KN: I think I started to realise that I could be funny in my second year of college. But I didn’t realise I could actually perform comedy until my last year of college in 2001, at Grinnell, Iowa. There was open-mic comedy night at my school when I was in my senior year and since my friends thought I was funny, I decided I’d try it. It went off really well, and I loved it. I had been studying computer science at the time, which was the degree I was aiming to get but I had no interest in it. So, after this unexpected success I graduated and moved to Chicago, because I knew a lot of comedians have come from there, to try my luck as a comedian.

Q. What was your family’s reaction when you decided to make a career out of stand-up comedy?

KN: I think they thought it was fun and cute, but they didn’t want me to quit my job, either. I had started working in tech support at the University of Chicago and had that job for six years. I was doing comedy at night and this office job during the day. When I quit my job I think they were concerned, but still very supportive.

Q. Do you feel you would have adopted this profession even if you had continued living in Pakistan?

KN: Honestly, I don’t know. I don’t think so, as it wasn’t a profession that was taken seriously back then when I was living there. It was like something that was so outside of possibility — I didn’t know anybody who was in this profession. I think if I had stayed in Pakistan, I would have been a doctor, like my father and maternal uncle. I am quite tickled actually, that my parents have finally had their dream come true, with my being awarded this honorary doctorate, as they can now boast to all their friends that their son is a doctor!!

Q. How did you get your first break?

KN: I moved to New York after I had been doing open mics and local comedy shows in Chicago for about six years — nothing fancy, just shows in the back of restaurants and small things like that. Then in New York, some of the well-known performers started asking me to open for them while they were on tour, so I would do ten or 15 minutes before the main act. Later, one of them got a TV show on Comedy Central and asked me to write for it. I would say that was my first real break.

Q. Have you co-acted with or interviewed any famous Hollywood celebs? If so, who?

KN: I’ve worked with a lot of people I’m a fan of, such as Conan O Brien and Stephen Colbert and have featured on their shows.

Q. Any unforgettable experiences while pursuing this career?

KN: Oh, so many. Getting to be in The X-Files was probably the highlight though. It was my favourite show growing up, so to get to be in one of the episodes was extremely exciting. And then, getting to write with my wife, and act in it, of course, was a very fulfilling experience as well.

Q. How did you meet your wife, Emily V. Gordon? Does she help you in your career?

KN: We met at a comedy show. She heckled me, and we fell in love. She helps me a lot. I used to always have her look at my jokes and she would offer me tips. And she supported me financially in our first year together in New York. I didn’t have a job; she did. I just did stand up comedy back then and was making no money doing it. Now she’s too busy writing TV shows herself so I can’t use her as much as I’d like to!

Emily and I have also produced a live TV show for Comedy Central, The Meltdown with Jonah and Kumail. We did that for six years and it ran for three seasons. We did a total of 30 episodes before deciding to end the show this June. We also cohost the podcast, The Indoor Kids.

Q. And how did you land up doing a mainstream Hollywood film?

KN: We had been working on this script for a long time, and Mike Showalter with whom we had become friends after Comedy Central, had seen the script and told us he wanted to direct the film. Then I happened to meet Judd Apatow at a festival and he asked me if I had any movie ideas. I said I did, and Emily and I immediately began to finalise the script. It took some time, but he loved it, and The Big Sick is finally going to see the light of day.

Q. How much time altogether did it take you two to write the script?

KN: It took us five years.

Q. What was the inspiration behind it?

KN: It was a real life event that had happened to my wife and me. I don’t want to disclose anything about the plot at this stage.

Q. How was the acting experience for you?

KN: Fun! I had only done small comedy parts in films such as Central Intelligence and Fist Fight earlier so getting to do drama was challenging but exciting. This is by the far biggest role I’ve ever had, as I’m the lead in it.

Q. Who are your co-stars in The Big Sick?

KN: Zoe Kazan, Holly Hunter, Ray Romano, Anupam Kher and Shanaz Treasury.

Q. Coming to the award you recently won — were you expecting this honour? Is it your first?

KN: Yes, it is. I was taken completely by surprise!

Q. Now that you have tried your hand at everything — acting, hosting, stand-up comedy and production — what do you enjoy the most and why?

KN: Right now, acting is the newest to me and it’s my favourite!

https://www.dawn.com/news/1559501,5/26/20 21:21,Kasur policeman arrested for allegedly killing teenaged boy for refusing relationship,"Khudian police have arrested a member of the Punjab Highway Patrol (PHP) police, who allegedly sexually harassed and later on Sunday shot dead an 18-year-old boy for allegedly refusing to have a relationship with him in Punjab's Kasur district, officials said on Tuesday.

The victim, who was shot dead near main Khudian bazaar in the limits of Khudian police station, is the son of a local prayer leader, on whose complaint a First Information Report (FIR) of the incident was registered.

Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar took notice of the incident and sought a report from the provincial police chief as outrage over the killing grew louder on social media. The chief minister, while condoling with the bereaved family, assured them of justice, according to reports.

The deceased was a Hafiz-e-Quran and a member of the Jamiat Ahle Hadith. The suspect, 30, is an official of the patrolling police who was posted at Noorpur police post at Deepalpur Road.

Both the victim and the suspect were stated to be fast friends and they reportedly had relations in the past, Station House Officer Mohammad Ashraf told Dawn.

The deceased's father stated in the complaint that the suspect stopped his son at the corner of an alley while the latter was walking to a mosque for Fajr prayers on Eid day. The suspect threatened the teenager with his gun and warned that he would kill him if he (the deceased) did not agree to have sexual relations with him, the FIR said.

After the victim turned down the suspect's overture, the police official allegedly opened fire on him, resulting in an injury, according to the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.

The complainant, who was nearby, said he and some other people tried to catch the suspect but he fled the scene while brandishing his weapon.

The injured victim was rushed to the Kasur District Headquarters Hospital where doctors referred him to Lahore General Hospital in critical condition. He later succumbed to his injuries at the Lahore hospital.

Police arrested the suspect soon after the incident and started an investigation into the case from various angles.

Police officials said investigators will also look beyond the details in the FIR to dispense justice and claimed that the incident had nothing to do with any sect or religious element.","['Afzal Ansari', 'T D', 'Adnan Mazher Khan', 'Azam', 'Imtiaz Ali Khan', 'Seshagiri Rao', 'Asif', 'A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1403802,4/25/18 18:06,Police exhume remains of Pakistani-origin Italian woman over 'honour' killing reports,"Police on Wednesday exhumed the body of an Italian national of Pakistani origin over claims she had been murdered by relatives in a so-called 'honour' killing, in a case that has made headlines across Italy.

Police in Gujrat launched an investigation earlier this week into the death of 26-year-old Sana Cheema after allegations she had been murdered went viral online.

“After the news of her death spread on social media, police found the family and started an investigation,” said police officer Waqar Gujjar.

A member of the media films the house of Sana Cheema in the neighbourhood of Mangowal, near Gujrat. — AP

Cheema's father, brother and uncle are currently being held in custody for questioning but have not been charged, added Gujrat police officer Mudassar Sajjad.

“Now it depends on the post-mortem report. If it determines the cause of death is due to murder, only then will police charge the suspects,” said Sajjad.

According to family members, Cheema died earlier this month after succumbing to an unspecified illness, said police officer Syed Mobarak.

Police said Cheema's father Ghulam Mustafa brought her back to Pakistan to get married. This ultimately led to a confrontation with a nearby family who spurned the offer of a match, according to the woman's family.

Because of the rejection Cheema refused to eat, fell ill and died, relatives told police.

Reports in Italian newspapers alleged Cheema was killed because she wanted to marry a man in Italy against her family's wishes. The reports further alleged that Cheema’s parents had been forcing her to marry someone in the family in the days leading up to her death.

A spokesperson for the Gujrat police had earlier told Dawn that Kunjah police visited Mangowal town, where Cheema had been staying with her family, and collected some information about her death which strengthened their suspicions about the version offered by the woman’s family.

Scores of women in Pakistan are still being murdered by relatives for bringing shame on their family, more than a year since new laws came into force aimed at stemming the flow of 'honour killings'.

The legislation mandates life imprisonment for honour killings, but whether a murder can be defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge's discretion.

That means the culprits can simply claim another motive and still be pardoned, according to Dr Farzana Bari, a widely respected activist and head of the Gender Studies Department at Islamabad's Quaid-i-Azam University.","['On Flip Side', 'Imtiaz Ali Khan', 'M.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1049079/judge-strikes-down-smoking-ban-in-ny-state-parks,10/12/13 7:05,Judge strikes down smoking ban in NY state parks,"NEW YORK, Oct 11: A US judge has ordered an end to a smoking ban imposed in public parks and beaches across New York state last February.

The ruling applies to 179 parks across the state, as well as beaches, sporting grounds, picnic spots, camping areas and historic sites run by the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.

A New York-based group, Citizens Lobbying Against Smoker Harrassment (C.L.A.S.H), had challenged the ban, on the grounds that parks had exceeded their authority.

New York State Supreme Court Justice George Ceresia ruled in their favour, declaring that the state parks agency had “extended their reach beyond interstitial rulemaking and into the realm of legislating.” C.L.A.S.H on Thursday welcomed what it called a vindication of individual freedoms.

“This is putting the prohibitionists on notice that, despite their ugly war being waged on adults who choose to smoke, they are not entitled to a free-for-all in governing when it comes to this segment of society,” said its founder Audrey Silk.

It has been illegal to smoke in bars, restaurants and work places in New York state for the last 10 years.

In New York City it is also illegal to smoke on public beaches, parks and public swimming pools since 2011.

According to police, the suspect stabbed to death his 24-year-old brother, Kashif, inside their home in Block 2 of Abidabad. The suspect managed to flee the crime scene but was later arrested by police.

While in custody, the man told the police that he killed his brother as he (Kashif) allegedly had ""illicit relations"" with his wife, a police officer told Dawn.

The police have registered a murder case against the suspect following a complaint filed by the third brother, Majid.

Honour killings continue despite new law

Scores of people in Pakistan, an overwhelming majority of whom are women, are still being murdered by relatives for bringing 'shame' on their family, more than a year since new laws came into force aimed at stemming the menace of 'honour killings'.

In October 2016, a joint sitting of both houses of parliament passed two key pro-women bills that had been pending assent for a long time.

The move at that time was cautiously hailed by women's rights activists. More than a year on, however, lawyers and activists say honour killings are still occurring at an alarming pace.

At least 280 such murders were recorded by the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan from October 2016 to June 2017 ─ a figure believed to be understated and incomplete.

The legislation mandates life imprisonment for honour killings, but whether a murder can be defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge's discretion.

That means the culprits can simply claim another motive and still be pardoned, according to Dr Farzana Bari, a widely respected activist and head of the Gender Studies Department at Islamabad's Quaid-i-Azam University.","['Imtiaz Ali', 'Philosopher', 'From Japan', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1197110,7/29/15 14:31,Is domestic violence less prevalent in arranged marriages?,"Many Muslim societies believe domestic violence against women to be less prevalent in arranged marriages. Empirical evidence from Pakistan, however, paints a rather nuanced picture.

For centuries, parents of young Muslim women have forced their daughters into arranged marriages, often with their cousins, to protect land holdings or conform to their tribal customs.

Parents conveniently assume, and the brides are made to believe, that by marrying their cousins, young women will not be subject to domestic violence, that strong familial ties will guard against such violence.

Marital bliss or marital blisters?

The Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) in 2012-13 interviewed over 13,500 ever-married women between the ages of 15 and 49. The USAID-sponsored survey provides a treasure-trove of data on the health and well being of women. The survey revealed that one in three ever-married women experienced physical violence since age 15, whereas one in five women experienced abuse in the year leading to the survey.

But physical violence is just one manifestation of abuse. Women also suffered emotional abuse at the hands of their spouses. Since the age of 15, two out of five women in Pakistan suffered, at least once, physical and/or emotional abuse at the hands of their spouses.

One in three women suffered the same in the year before the survey. Even pregnant women were not spared, one in 10 women suffered abuse while being pregnant.

For decades, married women in Pakistan have suffered in silence. More than half of the women whose husbands abused them never sought help or shared their sufferings with others. In their ignorance, the parents perhaps thought their daughters enjoyed marital bliss. However, domestic violence left them with marital blisters instead.

Family ties and family trees

The PDHS revealed that most women in Pakistan are married to their first cousins; only two in five women wedded unrelated spouses.

A relatively larger number of women married cousins on their father’s side than those on their mother’s side. This tendency is likely the result of family’s preferences to keep the agricultural land and other assets within the family even after the young women were married to their first cousins on the father’s side. The same does not hold for marrying cousins on the mother’s side.

Source: Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey, 2012-13.

Dr. Nisha Malhotra, who teaches at the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia, is curious to find out if cousin marriages protect women from spousal abuse.

Working with the PDHS, she found that the answer to this question is not that straightforward because the incidence of cousin marriages are not uniformly distributed across the urban-rural divide or are spread the same way across income strata.

Dr. Malhotra found cousin marriages to be more pronounced in rural areas where they accounted for 61 per cent of all unions compared to the 50 per cent of all urban unions.

And, whereas, only 32 per cent women were married to unrelated spouses in rural areas, a much larger proportion of urban women (45 per cent) had a similar union. Again, agricultural land is more commonly found in rural settings, which may be the reason why cousin marriages are more pronounced in rural settings.

Another reason could be the fact that villages are often established by rather insular communities (bradaries) where a large number of inhabitants are direct relatives.

An interesting picture emerges when we compare the incidence of domestic abuse for the types of spousal relations. The following figure presents a breakdown of domestic violence.

We see that 28 per cent of women married to unrelated men suffered physical (domestic) violence. A slightly lower fraction of women married to first cousin’s on their father’s side (26 per cent) suffered the same.

Surprisingly, a significantly larger proportion of women married to second cousins suffered physical abuse than those who married unrelated men. We see similar trends for emotional abuse.

Based on the preceding graphic and discussion should we conclude that cousin marriages do not necessarily lower women’s odds of being subject to domestic abuse?

Not so fast, says Dr. Malhotra. Since well-off, highly educated, and urban women are more likely to have married unrelated men, women’s odds of experiencing domestic violence should be estimated after one has controlled the factors mentioned above.

Dr. Malhotra estimated a statistical model where she controlled for income, education, and other related factors. She found that when we control for other mitigating factors, the odds of a woman to experience domestic violence are lower for those who married first cousins. The same was not true for those married to second cousins.

Despite the evidence showing less infrequent abuse in first cousin marriages, women should not be forced into marriages against their wishes so that they may avoid spousal abuse. In a just society, people are kind to all, and not just to their blood relatives.","['Murtaza Haider', 'Gaurav Arya', 'Rohit Sharma', 'Rex Major', 'Wandering Around', 'Aslam Shaikh', 'Vijay', 'Toronto', 'Agha Ata', 'Just Someone']","Many Muslim societies believe domestic violence against women to be less prevalent in arranged marriages.

https://www.dawn.com/news/538239/honour-killing-and-islam,5/28/10 0:00,Honour killing and Islam,"THE feudal structure of our society follows its own barbaric rules in order to perpetrate the inhuman and unjust system for the benefit of the few at the top rung of the hierarchical ladder. No matter which name they go by, the number of atrocities committed in the name of honour run into hundreds every year.

The despicable custom has filtered down to all the social classes, urban and rural. The heinous crime is committed in the name of honour to cover up property disputes, to avenge an old and festering enmity; or, if a woman asks for divorce from an abusing husband; or, to defend a murderer who has killed a man and tries to cover it up by killing an innocent woman, accusing the victims of being karo kari, and like cases. The term implies adultery, an extra-marital affair or sex outside of marriage, or obscenity, especially in the case of minors.

A double murder is also committed if a man and a woman decide to marry of their own choice. In many cases the woman victim might be the murderer's sister, ex-wife or some other relative. Since the murderer also pretends to be the aggrieved party, he can twist the case in his own favour by pleading that his honour was soiled, and that he had no other recourse but to kill the offender! He often manages to get off with a light sentence, if any at all. Close relatives of the slain are also known to forgive the killer.

If, today, a husband finds his wife committing adultery with a man, it is considered acceptable in many Muslim countries for the husband to kill both the partners in the act, and most certainly the wife. But the Quran has a completely different story to tell. In li'an,the procedure adopted when a husband accuses his wife of adultery, but cannot produce four witnesses, he is supposed to go to the authorities and has to swear four times that what he is saying is the truth. SurahAl-Nur says “Those who accuse their wives of adultery and cannot produce four witnesses, except for themselves, they should swear an oath by God four times that they are telling the truth. And swear a fifth oath invoking the curse of God if he is telling a lie. The punishment can be removed from the wife if she swears an oath four times by God that the husband is lying. And a fifth oath that the curse of God should be upon her if he, (the husband), is telling the truth.” (24 6-9).

If she confesses or remains silent, she will be given the punishment fixed for adultery. If she chooses to swear that she is innocent, her word will be upheld against that of the husband, and they can undergo a divorce.

Based on the sayings of the Prophet (PBUH), the child born thereafter will be called the child of the mother, and will not in any way be connected with the father. If after this anyone calls the woman an adulterer, or the child an illegitimate issue, that person can be given the punishment of 80 stripes due to a slanderer, who will never be treated as a reliable witness again (see 24 4). Unless a person can produce four witnesses, he should not bring up such a charge in the first place. Traditionally, the woman killed for karo kari is not given a proper burial, nor is she buried in the community graveyard. No one is supposed to visit the grave even later. Here it would benefit us to look at a hadith of the Prophet. Once a woman confessed to having committed adultery. The Prophet sent her back four times trying to avert the punishment, but she was persistent. At last she was given the punishment. After that the Prophet asked that her funeral prayer be said and she be buried in the same manner in which any other Muslim is buried.

The problem will persist until concrete steps are taken to eliminate honour killing. It is imperative that we include, train and re-orient the police and the religious leaders such as the pesh imams and the qaris in the scheme for reform. The religious leaders must be convinced that this practice goes against the Quran and should be asked to teach people in their sermons and the children in madressahs what an unjust act and a heinous sin and crime this brutal murder is. If we start now we can hope that at least our next generation will become more humane in the matter.","['Nilofar Ahmed', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1434076,9/20/18 16:18,Teenage girl with disabilities allegedly raped in Khanewal,"A 14-year-old girl with disabilities was allegedly raped by a neighbour in Khanewal's Kabirwala tehsil on Wednesday morning.

A first information report has been registered but the suspect has not been arrested as yet, Station House Officer (SHO) Tayyab Sarfaraz said.

The victim's father told DawnNewsTV that the suspect had raped his daughter in their home within the limits of the Bara Kata police station with help from an accomplice while he and the victim's mother were working in the fields.

He said that when they returned home, they found the victim unclothed. The daughter, who is unable to speak or walk properly, told her parents what had happened using gestures.

Upon discovery, the suspect fled the scene. When the victim's parents went to his house, they were told he was not there.

When the police later visited the suspect's house, they were also told that he was not there, the father said.

According to the FIR, the victim's father upon returning home caught the suspect in the act while an unidentified individual kept watch. When the suspect realised he had been discovered, he pulled out a pistol and threatened to shoot if anyone came nearer and then fled the scene of the crime.

A Medico-Legal Examination of the victim suggests the possibility that rape may have taken place, but the examination report said that a final opinion on the matter would be provided after the hospital receives final reports from the Punjab Forensic Science Laboratory.

SHO Tayyab Sarfaraz said a search operation for the suspect was underway, and that he would soon be dealt with in accordance with the law.

Locals from the area and the girls relative held a protest, demanding the arrest of the suspect. They alleged that the suspect had previously raped two other girls as well.","['Sajjad Akbar Shah', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

Bodies have been shifted to District Headquarters Hospital, Mandi Bahauddin for autopsy. Police said that a case will be lodged after a post-mortem examination of the victims.

Shaukat Rauf contended that he had been terminated without being given an opportunity of defence merely on a complaint lodged by a fellow teacher. The petitioner said he was a true Muslim having firm believe in finality of prophethood of Muhammad (PBUH) and had PhD degree in Islamiat.

He pleaded that his point of view was not heard by the authorities in a departmental inquiry, which was in sheer violation of fundamental right of fair trial.

He said the court had directed the respondent secretary to decide his departmental appeal against the termination but the order had not been complied.

The petitioner said the secretary committed contempt of court by not implementing the order and was liable to be punished under the relevant law.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1383093,1/15/18 17:15,"No, death penalty is not a solution to child sexual abuse","In 2016, eleven children in Pakistan reported being sexually abused every day, a 10% increase from the previous year. That is an average total of 4,015 every year. The numbers likely quadruple when one takes into account those children who suffer in silence.

In Pakistan, a country where 31% of the population is below the age of 14, silence is, in fact, often the only recourse available to victim-children.

Out of the 1,172 cases of rape, including gang-rape and sodomy, that were reported in 2016, only a handful made their way into public discourse.

The rest were forced to find their own way through a criminal justice system that provides virtually no safeguards for child complainants, hangs onto archaic procedures of investigating sexual crimes, and holds virtually zero convictions for sexual crimes in most districts.

Given the government’s pithy record in addressing child sexual abuse, the outrage and shock at the tragic murder of six-year-old Zainab in Kasur demonstrates our collective ignorance towards the plight of the most vulnerable.

Read next: Kasur as a political failure

In 2004, Punjab enacted The Punjab Destitute and Neglected Children Act with the aim of providing the province with its first ever institutional and legal framework for the prevention and protection of children against abuse and exploitation.

However, the district child protection units envisioned under the law were established only in six districts and even those remain non-functional today.

A Child Protection and Welfare Bureau, with the chief minister as its patron-in-chief, was tasked with the establishment and management of the child protection units.

However, in the eight-year tenure of the current chief minister, not a single meeting of the bureau has been conducted.

August, 2015 was the first time in Pakistan’s recent history that the public was forced to confront the impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators of child sexual abuse when vile video tapes, showing the molestation of over 400 children between 2006-2014, surfaced in Kasur.

A high-level inquiry committee constituted by the Punjab government dismissed the reports as baseless and the result of land disputes between a few parties.

In absence of any law criminalising acts of child sexual abuse, pornography and trafficking, the few arrests that were made could only be charged under general sections for sodomy and rape under the Pakistan Penal Code.

While the events were enough to jolt the legislature into finally pushing a bill through the parliament in March, 2016, as always, actual implementation remains wanting. That same year, civil society recorded 100 deaths of children as a result of rape.

Editorial: Protect our children

Protecting children from exploitation has never been on agendas nationwide. This holds true both politically and socially.

It is no surprise that Punjab, the province where 62% of all child sexual abuse cases occurred in 2017, has failed to develop its own child protection policy.

The draft developed by the Social Welfare Department has failed to attain approval of the cabinet because of other ‘more important agenda items.’

Any attempt to introduce Life Skills Based Education (LSBE) in mainstream curricula is instantaneously thwarted.

The Punjab government, in 2011, cancelled a memorandum of understanding for the inclusion of LSBE in curricula of public schools, bowing to right wing pressure.

Parents have often joined opposition against LSBE and have seldom taken it upon themselves to equip their offspring with any knowledge necessary to protect themselves against sexual abuse.

In fact, sexual abuse, particularly occurring within the home and family, is muted for the benefit of ‘family honour.’

Despite the dismal public and private safeguards in place against child sexual abuse, the call for action in the wake of Zainab’s horrific death has singularly focused on police negligence and public punishment for the perpetrator.

What remains missing from the debate is our social and political unwillingness to recognise the complete lack of child-responsive legal and social institutions in the country that prioritise child welfare above all other considerations.

Confronted with the heart-wrenching reality, we can no longer ignore the silent suffering of children.

However, holding on to the belief that public and extreme punishment for the perpetrator will remedy our consistent neglect and apathy towards the vulnerable, is grossly misguided.

Punishing a single perpetrator will simply appease our consciences under the false illusion that we have taken sufficient action to finally address the high rates of public and private sexual abuse and exploitation.

However, it is unlikely that the alarming rates of child sexual abuse will decrease without the implementation of child protection units at the district level, along with LSBE in school curricula and willingness at home to openly talk about the issue.

Social media has irresponsibly claimed that a public hanging in Iran solved the country’s child sexual abuse problem. Civil society and media reports continue to show high rates of child sex abuse in the country.

A recent study showed that around 100 to 150 children living on the streets are killed every month in Tehran for reasons including abuse.

According to government reports, over 21% of these children experience sexual exploitation, including the gang rape of an 11-year-old girl in Tehran in June, 2015.

Additionally, the highest rise in AIDS in Iran has been reported to be the result of children working on the streets infected through rape.

Clearly, the tragic events surrounding Zainab’s death should lead us to finally push for a much better state of affairs for our country’s children.

The abduction of children has already accounted for hundreds of executions in Pakistan since a moratorium was lifted in December, 2014.

If we continue to hold the belief that adding another death to the mix will create any impact on the security of our children, then we will continue to let them down.

It’s high time that we prioritise the protection of our children in all legal and policy agendas, while implementing the already existing child safeguarding mechanisms.

We owe it to children like Zainab, and countless others like her, to finally convert the effort we put into our impassioned responses to implementing dedicated and long-term strategies to prevent child sexual abuse from happening further.","['Zainab Z.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1533984,2/12/20 7:00,Sindh police law,"POST 18th Amendment, some quarters have questioned the status and validity of Police Order (PO) 2002 as a strictly provincial subject, which has lacked perspective of ground realities. Historically, federal law-enforcement authorities have remained active in maintaining peace in Karachi, which is why evaluating police law exclusively through the prism of provincial autonomy doesn’t seem appropriate. In a country where criminal law, evidence law and the senior police leadership (PSP) primarily belong to the federal structure — owing to internal security challenges and resource constraints faced by the provinces — it is difficult to clearly demarcate federal and provincial domains.

Even prior to the ongoing Rangers-led operation in Karachi, the city depended on federal reinforcements. Likewise, KP and Balochistan sought federal financing for law-enforcement projects such as conversion of ‘B’ into ‘A’ areas, raising the Balochistan Constabulary and the integration of forces of former Fata into the KP police.

In May 2019, the Sindh Assembly passed an amended bill; as per Article 116 (2A) it was forwarded to the governor. Following Article 116(2-B), the governor returned the bill for reconsideration to the Assembly. In June 2019, it was reconsidered, passed and forwarded to him. Since the governor did not assent within the 10 days specified in Article 116(3), the bill was deemed as passed.

The new law is known as the Sindh (Repeal of the Police Act, 1861 and Revival of Police Order 2002) Amendment Act 2019, and contains several flaws, eg the adopted law merged the previously exclusive public safety commissions and complaints commissions as a single entity. Meanwhile, Article 4 defines 22 duties of the police, including assistance to victims — but without increasing financial allocation, capacity building, and accountability; such an exhaustive list will remain an ideal. Then, Article 8 requires police departments to be organised on a functional basis, but the new law dropped the idea of ‘police accountability’ incorporated in Article 8 (2-E) in the original PO 2002. Naturally, without accountability, policing will face a public trust deficit.

How will the logical end be achieved without restructuring the police?

The inherited colonial policing model primarily catered to rural needs, although PO 2002 tried to address issues confronting both rural and urban policing. To meet urban challenges, PO 2002 introduced the concept of Capital City Police (CCP), but the recently adopted law omitted it. For big cities, Sir Oliver Gilbert Grace and Justice Cornelius recommended the commissionerate system in 1950 and 1962, which ensured functional autonomy of the police chief and improved public safety. The police committee headed by Aslam Hayat in 1985 also advised restructuring policing on the lines of a commissionerate system; they believed it would improve decision-making, response and accountability within the police. However, the adopted law seems averse to the needs of metropolitan policing.

In pre-independence Kolkata, the Calcutta Police Act, 1866, provided a way for a commissionerate system. Till independence, the city had 16 police chiefs; and after independence, 26 police commissioners were rotated. Now, Kolkata is the 15th most populated city in the world while Karachi is placed at 11. For Calcutta, the imperialists realised the need for an exclusive commissionerate system, but owing to an intense romance with the colonial-rural policing model, we seem to be enamoured of the status quo. This is apparent in the newly adopted law which has ignored the specific needs of command, operations, capacity building and public safety.

Although the National Action Plan says that the ongoing operation in Karachi will be taken to its logical end, how will that logical end be achieved without empowering and restructuring the police?

The adopted law amended the composition and selection process for members of the provincial and district public safety commissions, and the police complaints commissions. In the original PO 2002, the district public safety commission had eight to 12 members; half the members are to be district councillors, while the remaining are independent members. In the adopted law, one-third are to be elected members of the national and provincial assemblies; one-third district councillors; and the remaining independent members. Historically, district councils remained under the political influence of the party in power.

The enormity of internal security threats warrant that the law incorporate and address the needs of the CCP and reconnect the Sindh police law with the national public safety commission and National Police Bureau. To make the police true custodians of public safety, their composition needs to be amended in a way so that a balanced approach is attained while the IGP is empowered so that he has the exclusive authority to compose his team.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1345304,7/17/17 7:16,The truth about forced conversions in Thar,"The Hindu community in the desert region fears for its faith, and with good reason.

UMERKOT: “When a girl is brought before a qazi for conversion to Islam, the qazi must comply immediately. If he delays the conversion even to say his prayers, he himself becomes kafir,” said Pir Waliullah Sarhandi, a younger brother of Pir Mohammed Ayub Jan Sarhandi. The latter, who is gaddi nashin of the Sarhandi shrine in Samaro tehsil of Umerkot district, claims to have converted thousands of Hindu girls and young women to Islam, mostly those belonging to the scheduled castes — Bheel, Meghwar and Kohli. Allegedly, this includes forced conversions, as well as conversions of underage girls eloping with Muslim men.

The most recent case to have caused a stir is that of Ravita Meghwar: her parents claim their 16-year-old daughter was abducted by men from an influential Muslim community living near their village in Tharparkar district, forcibly converted by Pir Ayub Jan in Samaro and married off to one of her kidnappers. When Ravita appeared in court in response to her parents’ petition she refuted their account, maintaining that she had gone willingly and that she wished to stay with her husband, Nawaz Ali Shah.

It is a story that is playing on repeat in Tharparkar and Umerkot, districts that are home to large communities of Hindus — Tharparkar’s Hindu population is in fact around 50 per cent — and it threatens to wreck centuries of inter-communal harmony in the area. This is a part of the country where religion has traditionally been worn lightly. Instead, cultural commonalities bind the communities. At one time there was even social acceptance of Muslim men marrying Hindu women: former Sindh chief minister Arbab Rahim’s maternal cousin is one-time MPA Ram Singh Sodho, whose mother converted to Islam after marriage. Now locals profess increasing concern that Thar too like the rest of the country is becoming polarised along religious lines.

After the hue and cry over forced conversions in Umerkot and Tharparkar districts, the Sindh Assembly passed a bill against the practice in November 2016. But before the governor could sign it into law, some religious organisations threatened widespread agitation if the government did not withdraw it. Their main objection was to the provision stipulating that the conversion of underage individuals would not be formally recognised until they reached the age of majority. The attempted legislation was mothballed. Now however, the government has announced it will review the bill again. To what end, it is difficult to predict.

A little before sunset on an overcast day, Gulzar-i-Khalil, Pir Ayub Jan’s madressah in Samaro, looks drab and uninviting. Its dun-coloured façade with its peeling paint and barren surroundings has an air of neglect, and facilities for the students appear to be extremely basic — as if the owners have far more important things to attend to. In the grounds, groups of boys mill about, enjoying the weather during a break in their religious instruction. Two men are stooped over a griddle on a wood fire nearby, making chapattis for the evening meal at the madressah.

The pir’s brother, voluble and expansive, clearly takes pride in the institution’s reputation as a one-stop shop for no-questions-asked conversions. “We’ve converted untold numbers of Hindus to Islam,” he said, declaring himself unable to give a precise figure. “No one is forced to become a Muslim, there’s not even one instance of that,” he insisted. Pir Ayub Jan himself is in Karachi to gather support for putting pressure on Sindh’s legislators to withdraw the bill.

Similar to Bharchundi Sharif in Mirpurkhas district further north, the Sarhandi shrine is synonymous with religious conversions, but most of the conversions taking place at the latter are of Hindus living in lower Sindh. Even going by the estimates of those engaged in the conversion of non-Muslims in Tharparkar and Umerkot districts, the annual rate is at least in the several hundreds, possibly more.

“At least 25 conversions of young Hindu girls and women take place every month in Umerkot’s Kunri and Samaro talukas alone,” said an activist from a local human rights organisation. “This area is so deprived and the people, most of whom belong to the scheduled castes, are so powerless that the families know there’s no use in them reporting forced conversions to the police, let alone raising a hue and cry.” That is why only a miniscule number of alleged forced conversion cases make it into the media. According to a list compiled from news reports by the organisation mentioned above, in 2015 and 2016, only 13 Hindus in the Samaro and Kunri talukas converted to Islam.

However, a curious disparity is evident even in the few cases that have been reported. The list of 13 only includes two males. One of them is Dilip Kumar, an adult, and the other is Ramesh Bheel, a young boy who converted along with his mother Devi Bheel. Human rights activists in Umerkot and Mithi, Tharparkar’s largest town, ask in exasperation: “Why only young girls and women of marriageable age? Why don’t mature women convert? Why is the story always the same — a girl runs away with a Muslim man, converts to Islam and refuses to have anything more to do with her family, who have little choice but to stay quiet?”

Daughters gone forever

Shiv Dhan and Mani, however, did not stay quiet when their two daughters, Sonari and Samjoo, were abducted from home in the middle of the night on Jan 15, 2016 by a group of intruders armed with guns and axes. Among them was the son of a landlord who owned acres of land on the other side of the main road running alongside their village and who subsequently married Sonari. At his modest home, Shiv Dhan, who along with his wife works on a local landlord’s farm, reached into a crevice in the mudbrick wall and carefully pulled out a bundle of folded newspapers. The yellowing pages were a testament to the couple’s desperate struggle to get their daughters back. “Along with some members of our family, we occupied the road there and remained there for several days in protest,” he said. “We filed a case but they never let us meet her or talk to her alone.” Sonari maintained in court that she had converted to Islam and married of her own will.

Their sole comfort is that their younger daughter was returned in a few days: they have never met, or even seen 16-year-old Sonari since. Tellingly, when asked how many children he has, Shiv Dhan said he has one daughter and two sons. Whether he has become resigned to never setting eyes on Sonari again, or whether she is now dead to him after having changed her religion, it is difficult to tell.

Instances of Hindu men wanting to convert for the sake of marrying Muslim girls are virtually unheard of. One that did occur two years ago is illustrative of the power imbalance in the area’s social dynamics. A young Hindu man from Umerkot city was working in Karachi when he fell in love with a Pakhtun girl. He brought her to his native town, became a Muslim and married her. It was not long before the men from her family descended on his house, and not finding the couple there, abducted some women of his family. Although police rescued them before the men could go very far, the boy’s family returned the girl. “Do you ever hear of Hindu girls’ families being able to do something like this? They can’t because the police and agencies are all on the side of the Muslims,” said Ramesh Kumar*, a rights activist in Umerkot.

A demographic breakdown of the Hindu population in Sindh offers an interesting perspective on the travails of the community in Pakistan. According to Krishan Sharma, a Mithi-based human rights activist, northern and central Sindh are home to upper caste, well-to-do Hindu business families, who live in prime locations coveted by politicians and tribal sardars who want to invest in land, or set up petrol pumps, factories, etc. Often the long-term Hindu residents do not wish to sell their property, so “a situation is created to drive them out”. That can include kidnapping for ransom as well as forced conversion of their daughters.

“Contrary to perceptions, most of those in this category don’t migrate to India. They are shifting from Ghotki, Khairpur, Umerkot, etc to Karachi where they can be found in large numbers dominating the rice, pulses and cotton markets,” said Mr Sharma. “Ironically, Hindus feel safest in the country’s most lawless city.”

The highest number of Hindus in Pakistan, however, live in southern Sindh where most of them work as agro-based bonded labour. “They have no access to education, health or basic amenities. Their women and children work in the open all day, they’re visible, everyone can see them. They’re easy targets for the waderas’ sons and their henchmen.” (The daughters of Muslim haris elsewhere in the country are often no safer at the hands of waderas.) That is also why the highest number of forced conversions of Hindu girls and young women take place in the green belt of Umerkot district — rather than the arid Tharparkar district — where Muslims zamindars have vast landholdings and most of the haris are Hindu.

(Local Hindus are at pains to point out that it is only the wealthy Muslim zamindars that prey on their girls and women. Other Muslims in Thari society, they say, have always accorded them dignity and respect.)

According to human rights campaigners, older men lure and entice young and naive Hindu girls by promises of marriage that seem like a stepping stone to a far better life than they could ever dream of. “But even if no force is involved, this is not informed consent,” maintained one of these activists. “In the case of minors, it should not be deemed consent at all, but compulsion.”

Some of the largesse bestowed on new converts: free medicine, sewing machines, dowries for their daughters and brick and mortar living homes. The pictures are taken from the New Muslim Welfare Association booklet.

Dr Ramesh Vankwani, MNA and patron-in-chief of the Pakistan Hindu Council, said, “There is not even one case in which anyone has willingly converted. These men, who are often already married, kidnap the girls, keep them in their custody for 15 days, rape them, and through threats and intimidation, make the girls say they converted willingly”.

When a young girl finds herself in such a situation, she is left with few options. Returning home can mean putting herself and her family at risk of retaliation by her abductors. At the same time, and this is particularly in the case of older girls, she is also afraid the community may shun her because they see her as defiled. “For her to remain with the man can appear to be the lesser evil,” said Fatima Halepoto, a human rights lawyer. “What adds to the tragedy is that these girls, or even the children they bear, are never fully accepted into the man’s family either. I know of cases in which they are made to live in a room separate from the main house.”

Charity, but only for 'New Muslims'

However, it is not only the powerlessness of haris in the social hierarchy that gives license to wealthy waderas to take advantage of them. After all, Hindus have lived here since centuries; it is only in recent years that forced conversions have become such a burning issue. An increasing wave of fundamentalism in the area is also contributing to an indirect sanction of the practice. Moreover, this growing religiosity has given rise to another aspect of religious conversion, one that directly exploits the haris’ extreme poverty.

Certificate of conversion awarded by the JUI-F madressah.

About 20 kilometres north of Umerkot, near the garrison town of Chhor, lies the settlement of New Islamabad. Fresh converts are schooled for four months here in the basics of Islam after they recite the kalima at the imposing Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (Fazl) madressah complex in Chhor. The new Muslims receive a ‘sanad’ (certificate) upon completing their course.

The head of the madressah complex, an affable man by the name of Mohammed Yaqoob who is also the general secretary of JUI-F Umerkot district and the head of the Wafaqul Madaris Al-Arabia in Umerkot and Tharparkar districts, said: “We accept only families for conversion. New Islamabad can accommodate 40 families at a time. Twenty-three families have recently left and another 35 are due to arrive soon.” With a sheepish smile, Maulvi Yaqoob said he did not wish to speak ill of Pir Ayub Jan Sarhandi and agreed that Maulana Fazlur Rehman would not approve of the kind of conversions that took place in Samaro. He maintained that he refused to carry out conversions of Hindu girls accompanied by Muslim men wanting to marry them. “There is less Islam here and instead more of other things.”

At the same time, the madressah makes an exception for young Hindu men and women who cannot marry each other because of the many prohibited degrees of relationship in their culture. For them, changing their religion seems the only recourse.

Maulvi Yaqoob estimates that around 9,000 conversions have taken place at the madressah during the last 15 years. More recently though they have started maintaining a record, and he can confirm that last year, around 850 Hindus underwent conversion here.

In earlier years, he said, his compatriots had to often venture far afield in the area to preach, “but now 99.9 per cent of people who come to us for conversion come as a result of tableegh by the earlier converts”.

Another reason for impoverished lower caste Hindus to approach Maulvi Yaqoob for conversion may also be the largesse they receive upon entering the fold of Islam. The madressah’s New Muslim Welfare Association provides converts with brick and mortar homes to live in, ghee, flour, sewing machines, dowries for their daughters, etc. The ‘new’ Muslims are given the facility of cultivating crops on the surrounding land where a concrete-lined canal, supplying water to the Cantonment from Nara Canal in the east, provides water all year round. It is a vastly different scenario from the parched expanses where they wait anxiously for rains every year.

For progressives and rights activists in Thar, the rapidly expanding settlement of New Islamabad is further evidence that the secular nature of their society is being changed. “Where does the JUI get such lavish funding for all this construction and for maintaining the place?” said Akbar Soomro*, a development sector employee. Another social worker puts it bluntly: “The reason for what is happening is India’s close proximity to this part of Pakistan. Hindus, however loyal to this country, will always be suspect in the eyes of the establishment.”

According to MNA Ramesh Vankwani, “The forced conversions have set a precedent, that converting Hindus to Islam is sawab ka kaam. No one is protecting us, not even the state”.

Mr Sharma, the human rights worker based in Mithi, narrated a chilling incident. At a wedding function a few years ago, he found himself in conversation with a senior law-enforcement official.

“At one point he told me, ‘The state is not comfortable with you people’”, recalled Mr Sharma. “I asked if he was referring to Hindus. He said ‘No, everyone. In other border areas we get support and facilitation from people about the enemy, but we get no information from people in Tharparkar, from either Muslims or Hindus. There’s no support from the security perspective to the state.’ When I responded, ‘Should we Hindus leave?’ he said, ‘No we’re not asking for that. We simply want Muslims here to be better Muslims’.

Some time later, when I saw a vehicle belonging to the FIF [the Falah-i-Insaniyat Foundation, the charity wing of the Jamaatud Dawa], I realised this wasn’t an individual’s statement.”

From the point of the security forces, Thar’s geographical contiguity with India makes it a particularly sensitive area where cross-border infiltration makes it necessary to exercise more-than-usual vigilance over the local population, regardless of religious affiliation.

Salafi Islam comes to Thar

Nevertheless, say locals, while the state has little money for health, education or development in the area, there seems to be plenty of funding for new madressahs that have mushroomed since the early 2000s. It is not as though ultra conservative Islam has never existed here. Many decades ago, Badiuddun Shah Al-Rashdi, a cousin of Pir Pagara, brought the Salafi Ahle Hadith movement to Thar from Badin with funding from Kuwait.





However, in a society that valued its pluralism, the influence of its political arm, the Jamiat Ahle Hadith, remained confined to a few pockets, such as between Diplo — a town in Tharparkar — and Badin district. Until about 15 years ago, that is, when a hardline version of Islam began to spread throughout Thar. It found a natural ally in members of the Jamiat Ahle Hadith. These now form the bulk of the JuD presence here. According to locals, they seem to have unlimited funding at their disposal to build madressahs; they even purchase mosques to disseminate Salafi Islam.

Although most madressahs in Umerkot and Tharparkar districts belong to JUI-F, JuD’s presence in Thar is steadily increasing. (A few madressahs belong to the Jamaat-i-Islami as well.) This is despite the fact that JUD is on the Interior Ministry watchlist under Schedule II of the Anti Terrorism Act, which denotes that the government has reason to believe it may be involved in terrorism.

An enormous JuD centre is under construction just outside Mithi at the Nagarparkar road junction. Several people told Dawn that locals driving trucks with construction material for the building have to disembark outside the gate. The madressah’s own people take the vehicles inside, unload the contents, and bring the trucks back. Meanwhile in Mithi itself, the FIF has forcibly occupied a college property as its base.

In response to the contention that madressahs are increasing all over the country, rights activists in Thar say that the existence of a huge, largely destitute and marginalised Hindu population in the area means that the issue of conversions is far more complex than its proponents make it out to be. It also carries a high risk of violent social conflict.

Two years ago, in the run-up to Eidul Azha, JuD declared they would sacrifice cows in Mithi’s main Kashmir chowk that Eid. (Because so many Hindus live in Tharparkar, there is no cow slaughter in Mithi, while only one shop in Umerkot town sells beef.) But the residents, both Hindu and Muslim alike, went to the maulvi and asked him not to create fasaad between the communities. Thus far, according to locals, JuD is not involved in conversions of Hindus. “They’re concentrating on making better Muslims of the Muslims for now,” said a Hindu social worker.

Most intriguing though, given the animosity in Pakistan towards proselytising by any religious community other than Muslims, is the space allowed to Christians, mainly Irish Catholic, and Ahmadis to operate their centres in Thar — some in close proximity to madressahs. (Ahmadis in particular have to contend with institutionalised discrimination and persecution in the rest of the country.) The Christian and Ahmadi missionaries offer impoverished Hindus schools, health clinics etc as an inducement — in fact, it is not unknown for the converts to revert to their old faith if the projects fail to materialise or come to an end. “If a Hindu becomes a Christian here, or even an Ahmedi, it's not a problem just as long as he ceases to be Hindu,” said Mr Soomro, the human rights activist.

Thar has long been known for communal harmony, negligible incidence of crime and a benign social ethos. If, as the locals fear, things proceed along the same trajectory, the part of Pakistan they call home may become engulfed in the kind of turmoil that has proven such a formidable challenge to the state elsewhere in the country.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1395209,3/14/18 13:16,Man axes mother of eight to death over 'honour' in Badin,"A man in Badin surrendered himself to police on Wednesday after killing his 38-year-old wife for 'honour' by repeatedly hitting her with an axe.

The suspect told police that he suspected that the victim — who was the mother of eight children, including three differently-abled daughters — had illicit relations with another man who lived in the same area.

Eyewitnesses said that after being attacked, the woman ran out on the street crying for help but the suspect continued to attack her, eventually killing her.

The incident was confirmed by Assistant Sub-Inspector Mohammad Salim Khoso of Badin police station, who said that the body had been sent to Indus Hospital for post-mortem examination. A first information report (FIR) is yet be to registered.

In a separate incident, a man killed his 25-year-old wife and a mother of one, along with another man for the sake of ""honour"" in the Dilawar Marfani village of Shikarpur.

The Station House Officer of Dilawar Marfani police station Shahzado Dasti told Dawn.com that the accused suspected that his wife had an extra-marital affair with his second victim, who hailed from Balochistan and worked as a peasant in the village.

The bodies of the victims were returned to their families after a post-mortem examination was conducted at Garhi Yasin Taluka Hospital.

No FIR has been registered yet.

Honour killings continue despite new law

Scores of women in Pakistan are still being murdered by relatives for bringing shame on their family, a year since new laws came into force aimed at stemming the flow of 'honour killings'.

In 2016, the joint sitting of both houses of parliament finally passed two key pro-women bills that had been pending assent for a long time.

The move at that time was cautiously hailed by women's rights activists. More than a year on, however, lawyers and activists say honour killings are still occurring at an alarming pace. One of the reasons of the continuation of such incidents is that though the legislation mandates life imprisonment for honour killings, whether a murder can be defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge's discretion.

That means the culprits can simply claim another motive and still be pardoned, according to Dr Farzana Bari, a widely respected activist and head of the Gender Studies Department at Islamabad's Quaid-i-Azam University.

At least 280 such murders were recorded by the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan from October 2016 to June of 2017 ─ a figure believed to be underestimated and incomplete.

The Aurat Foundation’s annual report of 2016 showed 7,852 cases of violence against women.

According to Saima Munir, who works for the Aurat Foundation, there has been a 70 per cent increase in honour killings in 2016.","['Hanif Samoon', 'Rasheed Khan', 'Kathua Khan', 'Iqbal Janjua', 'Satyaki Datta', 'Ibrahim Marghoob', 'Images Staff', 'Khurram Husain', 'F.S.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1501033,8/22/19 21:45,"FIA arrests 3 suspects in different cases of online harassment, blackmailing","The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) said on Thursday its Cyber Crime Unit in Lahore has arrested three suspects for harassing and blackmailing three separate women, including a foreigner.

The agency also filed three separate cases under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA). The FIA officials also recovered digital equipment, including cell phones, allegedly used in the commission of the crimes.

FIA CCRC Lahore Deputy Director Chaudhry Sarfraz told Dawn.com that one complaint had been submitted by a man that his sister was being harassed and blackmailed on the basis of some objectionable pictures and videos. The complainant had also nominated a suspect, a resident of Gujranwala.

Later, the agency conducted a raid and successfully recovered a mobile phone containing the objectionable material and alleged fake Facebook ID of the complainant’s sister, through which the content was being disseminated.

""After recovery of alleged material and sufficient incriminating evidence, the accused person was arrested and recovered mobile phones and other digital media was taken into custody of FIA through seizure memo.""

In another case, a woman approached the agency with complaints about harassment and blackmailing by a named accused, a resident of Sargodha. Yesterday, a team of the agency recovered a mobile phone containing the objectionable material and alleged WhatsApp through which the accused had transmitted the objectionable material to the complainant's relatives.

""After recovery of alleged material and sufficient incriminating evidence, the accused person was arrested and recovered mobile phones and other digital media was taken into FIA's custody,"" the official said.

In the third case, a Malaysian national through diplomatic channels approached the agency with complaints of harassment, threats, blackmailing and transmission of edited family pictures through social media by a named suspect.

The agency probed the matter and arrested the nominated suspect from his residence in Lahore. The FIA also successfully recovered a mobile phone containing the objectionable material and alleged WhatsApp through which the suspect had allegedly transmitted the material.

""Further investigation [into the three cases] is being carried out and the progress will be followed up accordingly,"" the FIA said.

In April, the agency had told the National Assembly's standing committee on Information Technology and Telecommunication that Facebook and Twitter's uncooperative response made it difficult for the agency to resolve cyber crime complaints.

An FIA officer had apprised the NA body that the agency received 29,577 complaints regarding social media over the last two years. He said of the total complaints, 9,822 pertained to fake social media accounts, of which 8,723 complaints were resolved by shutting down the said accounts.

The official told the committee that it had received complaints against 34,846 webpages, of which it took action against 28,460 and shut them down. He said that since Aug 2016, it has received 15,433 complaints regarding Facebook, 6,067 regarding Twitter and 3,143 regarding Whatsapp — all of which are currently being worked on.

He said that Facebook and Twitter's response in addressing their concerns is ""not good"", which makes it harder for it to resolve complaints.","['Adil Jadoon', 'Iqbal Hadi Zaidi', 'Sajjad Memon', 'Azam', 'Mansur Ul Haque', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

Speaking to media personnel relatives blamed the PCB for the young sportswoman's death and added that the dismissal of harassment charges against Maulvi Sultan Alam and his subsequent damages claim worth 20 million rupees had disheartened Halima Rafique and driven her to commit suicide.

Three of the accusing cricketers had appeared before the committee and denied charges of sexual assault.

However, Rafique and another female cricketer who had made the accusations had not appeared before the committee.

However, Rafique and another female cricketer who had made the accusations had not appeared before the committee.","['cricket', 'mysterious', 'relatives', 'sexual', 'rafique', 'multan', 'female', 'committee', 'circumstances', 'halima', 'death', 'teenage', 'pcb', 'dies', 'cricketer']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189f00b83e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0d52ba8a43.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d005917e0.jpg?0.8785461548197806', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'http://i.dawn.com/large/2014/07/53c4c555e3078.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2014/07/53c4c555e3078.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21824a8678.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189916390d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0ec56aad75.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd22283a73d3.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fc7833a64a3a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18a3ece187.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1a195e7829.png?r=620371018', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f94d8916a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f4142e469.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24c3aad888.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24e90196c5.jpg'}",TRUE,http://i.dawn.com/large/2014/07/53c4c555e3078.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': ""Relatives of the 17-year-old held the PCB responsible for the cricketers 'suicide.'"", 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'http://www.dawn.com/news/1119374', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Teenage cricketer Halima Rafique dies under mysterious circumstances', 'description': ""Relatives of the 17-year-old held the PCB responsible for the cricketers 'suicide.'"", 'image': 'http://i.dawn.com/large/2014/07/53c4c555e3078.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'http://www.dawn.com/news/1119374', 'title': 'Teenage cricketer Halima Rafique dies under mysterious circumstances', 'description': ""Relatives of the 17-year-old held the PCB responsible for the cricketers 'suicide.'"", 'image': 'http://i.dawn.com/large/2014/07/53c4c555e3078.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2014-07-15 11:06:20', 'modified_time': '2014-07-15 15:45:35', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/202/dawn-com'}, 'author': 'Dawn.com'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1430145,8/31/18 17:15,FIR registered against KE in 8-year-old boy's amputation incident,"Karachi police on Friday registered a first investigation report (FIR) against K-Electric after both arms of an eight-year-old boy had to be amputated by doctors due to severe burns he had sustained after an 11,000-Volt electrical wire fell on him in the street where he was playing.

The incident took place in Ahsanabad Sector-4 off Superhighway on Aug 25. As a result of the electric shock, both of the boy's arms were badly burnt and doctors had to amputate them in order to save his life.

The FIR was registered upon the boy's father's complaint.

A KE spokesman had told Dawn on Thursday that they were deeply saddened by the unfortunate incident. “We extend our sympathies to the family. We are taking this matter seriously and remain available to extend support to the family, including medical expenses during this time and for further treatment or rehabilitation,” the spokesman said.

According to the father, despite KE's announcement of assistance for the boy's medical treatment, no one has contacted the family as yet.

Sindh Governor Imran Ismail had also taken notice of the incident and sought a report from the commissioner. He had instructed him to provide the best treatment to the child.

PTI leader and MPA-elect from the locality Haleem Adil Shaikh expressed regret over the incident and told the media that such accidents have become a norm due to K-Electric’s negligence. He assured the family of the boy of every possible help.

A similar incident had taken place in Model Colony around the same time last year when another eighth-year-old boy, Azaan, lost his life after being electrocuted from a pole leaking current.

Area residents had complained about the matter to KE but their slow response led to the loss of a young life four hours later.","['Asim Khan', 'Touseef Zaidi', 'Omaid Qasim Overseas Pakistan', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1367296,10/31/17 2:37,The boy and the country,"The writer is Dawn’s correspondent in Delhi.

WE can take the boy out of the country. The challenge is to take the country out of the boy. Through all the decades since school and college, I have lived with a silent difference of opinion with classmates who thought much of the institutions where we studied. La Martinière College in Lucknow was built by Claude Martin and Aligarh Muslim University was set up by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan. I trusted neither, but I was lucky to have great teachers on both occasions.

The reason for my aloofness was my early unease with the fact that that I was in Hodson House in La Martinière College, Lucknow. The house was named after an unspeakably callous British captain who had gouged out the eyes of the grandchildren of India’s last Mughal emperor and murdered them at Delhi’s Khooni Darwaza (bloody gate) now located near the Indian Express office. There was a Cornwallis House named after the man who was thrashed in the battle of Yorktown by the Americans. His British godfathers, however, elevated him as governor general of India.

My school’s founder Claude Martin had built the cannon that Lord Cornwallis used to slay Tipu Sultan with, not without the help of Maratha troops and soldiers of the nizam. This aspect of Maratha valour is seldom discussed in school books, how they helped the British and the nizam take down Tipu. Since Hindutva ideologues despise Tipu, they should perhaps build a temple around the Cornwallis cannon, which is displayed in front of the main school building in Lucknow.

Martin was himself a French mercenary who defected to the British side after Clive overwhelmed Dupleix in southern India, not militarily, but by a diplomatic subterfuge in Europe whereby the British and the French joined hands in a treaty to redistribute the spoils of colonialism.

A less discussed attribute of the 19th-century educationist is that he was a social snob.

It was the 200th birth anniversary of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan on Oct 17 and there were the familiar eulogies at seminars and symposiums. Some Indians or Pakistanis like him, a few adulate him, and most ignore him. Partly, Allama Iqbal’s towering presence as a liberating (some say revivalist) Muslim icon crowds out the older Sir Syed. A less discussed attribute of the 19th-century Muslim educationist is that he was a social snob who reserved thinly veiled scorn for the less privileged men and women in his community, at par in this way with any caste-embracing Brahmin.

There are good reasons to have a higher regard for Raja Ram Mohan Roy who Sir Syed emulated in some ways, as a Western-inspired educationist, although there was a half-century of turbulence diving them, including the great revolt of 1857. Roy initiated social reforms within his Hindu community, working to ban sati and inspiring the next generations to work against regressive Hindu practices like child marriage, while encouraging widow remarriage and so on. In the course of his reforms, he shook the hidebound caste structures.

I am grateful to Sir Syed for setting up the Aligarh University where I got to study history with Irfan Habib and Shakespeare with Zahida Zaidi. The latter had helped shape the artistic careers of Naseeruddin Shah and Muzaffar Ali, directing them in numerous Chekhov and Ionesco plays she staged in the verandah of her famed home. Habib had the hard task of fighting Hindu and Muslim communalists who stalked the campus or preyed on it from outside. Habib, a Marxist and Zahida Zaidi, a left-leaning liberal, would perhaps have more in common with Majaaz, Sardar Jafri or Jazbi who were students at Aligarh before them. I can’t see either of the two respected teachers being influenced by any significant aspect of Sir Syed’s pursuits, be they religious or societal. His academic research into aspects of Indian Muslim history has been more useful.

Masood Alam Falahi has worked closely on the Urdu sources of the period to throw light on Sir Syed’s worldview. In an address to the second convention of the Muhammadan Educational Conference in Lucknow in 1887, Syed Ahmad claimed that “lowly [adna] families” were “not useful [mufid] for the country or for the government”. In contrast, the “nobles (ra’is) of high-status [’ala] families” were loyal to the British and so “are useful to the country and the government”.

He referred to “Pathans, Syeds, Hashmis and Quraishis” as his “own brothers [hamarey bhai]”, “from whose blood ... the smell of the blood of Abraham emanates”. He shared their hope that they would be employed in top posts in the British Army, “wearing shimmering uniforms”. He assured them that this would happen soon, but for this, he added, they would have to win the favour of the British. He also advised the Muslim ashraf attending the conference that only through higher modern education could they succeed and progress.

Sir Syed was not unique in his avowed casteism but merely following a tradition of elitist Hindu-Muslim bonhomie to the exclusion of Hindu-Muslim hoi polloi. In this sense, Begum Hazrat Mahal, the valiant warrior of 1857, may have set the example for Sir Syed’s clear prejudices though he disagreed with her role in fighting the British.

“Everyone follows his own religion [in my domain],” Hazrat Mahal wrote in a pamphlet she circulated from exile. “Everyone enjoys respect according to their worth and status. Men of high extraction, be they Syed, Sheikh, Mughal or Pathan among the Mohammedans, or Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaish or Kayasth among the Hindus, all these retain the respectability according to their respective ranks. And all persons of a lower order such as a Sweeper, Chamar, Dhanook, or Pasi cannot claim equality with them.”

I am not surprised that Begum Hazrat Mahal lost the battle against British colonialism. As for Sir Syed and Claude Martin, they represented colonialism’s positive moments but only in the interest of colonialism. There is much for the boy to learn still.

http://herald.dawn.com/news/1153698,3/17/17 10:52,"Forced conversion, marriage and the endless cycle of misogyny","The entrance to Youhanabad, Lahore | M Arif, White Star

At a small, nondescript house-cum-legal aid organisation in Youhanabad, one of Lahore’s largest Christian neighbourhoods, Sidra Javed, 19, quietly tucks a loose strand of hair into her flame-coloured hijab.

“On October 10, 2016,” she begins, “I was babysitting my six younger siblings when I received a message on mama’s mobile phone.” It was Muhammad Atif, the landlord’s son, who had been messaging Sidra – on the phone her mother left behind in case of an emergency – and threatening her for two weeks.

“Run away with me or see what I do to your father and eight-year-old brother,” read the last message.

Sidra slipped out of the door of her quarters in Joseph Colony, Badami Bagh, and saw Atif in the darkening dusk. With a gun to her head, Sidra sat behind him on his motorbike, and was driven to a house on the outskirts of Lahore in which she was sexually assaulted. Then she was taken to a law office, where she was told to convert, followed by signing a nikah nama or Islamic marriage certificate. “The lawyer, Maulvi Sahab, and others there did not ask for my birth certificate or ID card. I told them I’m Christian, the daughter of a pastor, and I wouldn’t want to convert — the four or five men there were furious to hear that, and I was scared. When they asked me to recite the First Kalima, I did,” Sidra says.

Sidra was able to escape after two months of marriage. But of the 1,000 Christian and Hindu women forcibly converted to Islam and forcibly married in Pakistan each year, seven hundred of them Christian, according to the National Commission of Justice and Peace and the Pakistan Hindu Council (PHC), few are as fortunate.

A 2014 report by the Movement of Solidarity and Peace in Pakistan says forced conversion and marriage begets further violence as victims are subjected to sexual violence, rape, forced prostitution, human trafficking or sale, or domestic abuse. With the National Assembly passing the Criminal Laws (Amendment) Act 2016 earlier in February, however, amendments to laws suggesting punishment for forced marriage of minors and/or women from minorities are on the horizon.

When there is doubt about whether an individual has been forcibly converted and married, a conversion certificate becomes the trump card

But how much of a difference will it make? Joseph Francis, National Director of the Center for Legal Aid Assistance and Settlement (CLAAS), a legal aid organisation focusing on the rights of Pakistan’s minorities, says it’s not easy to prove forced conversions or marriages.

A forced conversion is when physical, emotional, or psychological pressure, force, or threat is used to make an individual adopt another religion. A forced marriage is when one of the parties does not consent to marry the other or one of them is under duress or threat. Francis, however, says when forced conversions and marriages go hand in hand – a forced conversion driven by a perceived religious obligation, taking cover behind marriage, or a forced marriage driven by lust, taking cover under conversion – it allows for and creates legal loopholes.

It’s just such a loophole that Ali Raza, 23, exploited in kidnapping Monika, 12. Raza and Monika’s father Alfred Gharib Dass, 52, were security guards at St Thomas High School in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat, where both lived with their families. On August 11, 2016, Alfred dropped his elder daughter to work, and came home to find Monika missing. He filed a First Information Report (FIR) at the Liaquatabad police station; four days later, an investigation officer told him Raza had converted Monika to Islam and married her. Monika was a minor under Pakistan’s Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929, according to which girls cannot marry before 16, and Raza had broken the law by marrying a 12-year-old girl.

What may have been an open-and-shut case found legal cover under Monika’s conversion. “A lot of times, a legitimate birth certificate is not taken as seriously as a forged conversion certificate [which depicts a minor as older than 18],” Francis told the Herald. And in situations where an individual is not a minor, it is even easier to allege a forced conversion and marriage were really voluntary. When there is doubt about whether an individual has been forcibly converted and married, a conversion certificate becomes the trump card.

From the forced marriage to the registration of the FIR by the girl’s family to the courtroom, a conversion certificate is what overrides marriage laws. Whether it’s Section 365-B of the Pakistan Penal Code which delegitimises a marriage under duress or force, or the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929, or the Christian Marriage Act of 1872 under which a married Christian woman forced to marry a Muslim remains married to her Christian husband; Islamic institutions, law enforcement, and the judiciary are, by and large, biased towards a Muslim who has converted a non-Muslim, according to the Movement of Solidarity and Peace’s 2014 report, or they are under the pressure of religious and other lobbies.

""Men like to witness the success of a conversion and marriage, often perceived as a religious victory.""

Ayra Indreas, who teaches Women’s Studies at Kinnaird College in Lahore, says, “Last year, there was a case where a Christian girl, her new Muslim husband and a lot of influential Muslim men, big cars and Kalashnikovs in tow, came to the court. And the Christian girl’s family was fearful, poor, few in number, standing on the other side of the room. I know the judge was under a lot of pressure.” Men like to witness the success of a conversion and marriage, often perceived as a religious victory, she told the Herald.

Law enforcement agencies like one’s local police station, are a mixed bag of sorts. According to Sidra’s father, Javed Masih, 45, filing an FIR at the Badami Bagh police station was slow and painstaking. “We believe investigation officers were bought out by the boy’s father, our landlord, because our neighbours told us the officers and the boy’s father were friendly.”

However, Monika’s mother Shazia Bibi told the Herald the Liaquatabad police station at which Alfred, her husband, filed an FIR not only raided Raza’s home but were infallibly supportive throughout her case, at least until Alfred dropped the FIR itself.

“You have to keep in mind the theory of ‘triple oppression’; you’re female, you’re a minority, and you’re from a low-income background, and the intersectionality of the three will force Christian girls into the most vulnerable positions.""

Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Haider Ashraf admits abductions or forced marriages happen. But, he adds, “I’m not privy to forced conversions, and I don’t believe Christian girls are abducted or forcibly married any more than Muslim ones. Seasoned, senior investigative police officers record statements of abducted or forcibly married girls, and are able to gauge their accuracy. Between statements recorded by police and judiciary, I don’t believe these girls are under duress — all of this is rumour-mongering, we are an open and free society.”

Where it all begins, however, is with the Muslim clerics and/or institutions where a forced conversion and marriage is contracted. Maulana Tahir Ashrafi, member of the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), says a forced conversion is not permissible in Islam. Yet, he says, “If someone comes to me, and wants to be a Muslim, I’ll look at the background but I won’t turn her away.” Not even if she’s a minor.

Ashrafi and others pressured Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari recently, asking him to strike down the passed Sindh Criminal Law (Protection of Minorities) Bill, 2015, meant to protect non-Muslim girls from forced conversion before the age of 18. “Why must someone have to turn 18 before accepting Islam? You should not have an age limit for conversion,” says Ashrafi.

Aside from pressure on institutions like law enforcement and the judiciary, a forced conversion and marriage case will often fall flat because the Christian girl – who is in the custody of the husband – will say she was not forced to convert and marry but did so voluntarily. Executive Director at the Center for Social Justice, Peter Jacob, says, “An element of coercion and duress must be taken into account.”

Although the Punjab government, in particular, has Darul Aman women’s shelters where a Christian girl may reside during the span of a trial, many times it will result in more duress for the girl. Sidra, who stayed at a shelter with links to the legal aid organisation handling her case, says, “I didn’t like staying at the shelter because I worried about my family. I worry more about them than I do about myself. I’m scared of what my husband may do.”

Muddying the waters further is the question of what happens if and when the Christian woman who is forcibly converted and married happens to already be married to a Christian man under the Christian Marriage Act. In Pakistan, separate personal laws, including marriage laws, are in place for Muslims and non-Muslims. What if a Christian girl wants to marry a Muslim? If she’s already married under the Christian Marriage Act, she is not allowed to re-marry anyone else. If she is unmarried, the Christian Marriage Act will still apply in an interfaith marriage. How does a Muslim man who wants to force a Christian woman to marry him circumvent this without breaking the law? It’s as simple as forcing her to convert to Islam, after which a marriage contracted under personal laws for non-Muslims will be overridden by a nikah nama.

From the forced marriage to the registration of the FIR by the girl’s family to the courtroom, a conversion certificate is what overrides marriage laws.

Mary Gill, a lawyer and member of the provincial assembly of Punjab, says, “Not one political party is ready to address the issue of forced conversion and marriage. It’s not a priority in manifestos, or for the government — not even for their pro-women policies. It’s something they believe they can’t take on. Sindh had the courage to legislate on this issue but religious parties opposed it vociferously. At the end of the day, we need political will.”

Parliamentary ministers, such as the federal and provincial ministers of human rights – both Christian – do not hold themselves accountable to the Christian community, Bishop Emeritus Alexander John Malik tells the Herald. “Our representatives aren’t accountable to the constituencies. When I say, ‘You are not doing anything for Christians,’ they say ‘Who are you, Bishop? We are not accountable to you; we are accountable to our political party.’”

Jacob says the need of the hour is a law like the Sindh Assembly’s bill which not only tackles forced marriage as does the Criminal Laws (Amendment) Act 2016 but also looks at the forced conversions under which forced marriages take cover. “This is a situation that is specific to Pakistan. These women and their families do not have the socio-economic or political influence to limit the abuse against them,” he tells Herald. Indreas agrees. “Whenever you speak of minority women,” she says, “You have to keep in mind the theory of ‘triple oppression’; you’re female, you’re a minority, and you’re from a low-income background, and the intersectionality of the three will force Christian girls into the most vulnerable positions. Our social norms override our legal protections.”

(In March, the National Assembly passed the Hindu Marriage Bill 2016, following amendments made by the Senate, in order to prohibit the marriage of Hindu minors under 18 and regulate Hindu marriages. Tabled before the house by Minister of Human Rights, Kamran Michael, the bill will need the signature of President Mamnoon Hussain in order to become a law.)

But for Shazia Bibi, 12-year-old Monika’s mother, the pain is unrelenting. Two months after Monika’s abduction, Shazia’s husband Alfred told his lawyer and his wife that he could not go through his suffering and dropped the case and the FIR. Less than 10 days later, Alfred had a fatal heart attack. Holding a grainy, fading photograph of a long-haired, kohl-rimmed girl whose dark stare bores into one’s soul, Shazia says, “She was my offspring. I kept her in my womb for nine months. Then I gave birth to her, and raised her with so much love — my heart is broken, and only I know how much.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1511250/call-to-build-consensus-on-multi-sectoral-response-to-gender-based-violence,10/17/19 7:02,Call to build consensus on multi-sectoral response to gender-based violence,"PESHAWAR: Representatives of health, justice, police and social services sectors identified the areas of collaboration and gaps in providing multi-sectoral response to gender-based violence (GBV) against women and girls at a consensus-building meeting here on Wednesday.

The ‘Essential Service Package (ESP)’ was jointly launched by the social welfare department in collaboration with UNFPA, UN Women, UNODC and WHO - an initiative to strengthen public institutions’ capacity in addressing GBV.

The package reflects on vital components of coordinated multi-sectoral services for GBV survivors that should be provided by the health, social service, police and justice sectors.

MPA Ayesha Bano was the chief guest on the occasion.

The two-day meeting, which concluded on Wednesday, started with presentations on the mapping of sector-specific SOPs and guidelines used in the province for responding to or preventing GBV against women and girls. Presentations were followed by extensive discussion and recommendations were made to build consensus on multi-sectoral response.

In her remarks, UNFPA focal person Dr Farhat Sheikh said UNFPA’s Gender Equality Strategy focused on empowering women and girls by strengthening institutional accountability and implementing an integrated approach that is rights-based, participatory, people-centered, transformative, and evidence-based. UNFPA has been collaborating closely with government for the development and implementation of a coordination mechanism on GBV prevention and response in humanitarian and development settings, she explained.

Dr Sheikh said it had been providing technical assistance and support to government institutions to build their capacity, strengthen systems and improve the implementation of policies and programmes. Today’s consultation, she said, was an important step in that regard.

Dr Sheikh said Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) 2017-18 reflected that 34 per cent of married women (15-49) had experienced spousal physical, sexual, or emotional violence. The percentage of women who have experienced spousal physical, sexual, or emotional violence is highest in the newly-merged districts (66 per cent), followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (52 per cent), Balochistan (49 per cent), Punjab (32 per cent) and Sindh (18 per cent).

As an outcome of the meeting, action points were identified for inter-departmental coordination for referral to ensure greater access to a set of essential and quality multi-sectoral services for all women and girls, who had experienced GBV.

On the occasion, MPA Ayesha Bano reiterated the government’s commitment to improving policies and legislations to respond to women survivors of violence.

Social welfare department secretary Mohammad Idrees Khan demonstrated commitment to ensure quality, timely and coordinated response services for GBV survivors through multi-sectoral response mechanism.

Rukhshanda Naz, ombudsperson on protection against harassment, highlighted the gaps in the criminal justice system and also emphasised that they should ensure budgetary and resource allocation for the implementation of laws.

Rafat Sardar, chairperson KP Commission on the Status of Women, showed full commitment to the cause and assured her support for multi-sectoral prevention and response mechanism to GBV.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1584162,10/10/20 7:05,Six underage boys get bail in Karachi University harassment case,"KARACHI: A judicial magistrate on Friday granted bail to six teenage suspects held for allegedly harassing female students in Karachi University.

Police claimed to have arrested the suspects, all said to be the children of KU employees, and booked them for allegedly harassing female students on the campus.

On Friday, the investigating officer produced them before the judicial magistrate (East) to seek their physical remand for interrogation and investigation.

However, the suspects moved an application, through their defence counsel, seeking grant of post-arrest bail.

The defence counsel opposed the IO’s request for police remand stating that they were underage and the case against them was without any merits.

He asked the judge to grant them post-arrest bail.

After hearing arguments from the state prosecutor, the judge granted bail to the suspects against a surety of Rs20,000 each.

The judge turned down the IO’s request for remand of the suspects, who were told to cooperate with the police during the investigation of the case.

On Thursday, the varsity administration had handed over the suspects, said to be residents of KU’s staff town, to the Mobina Town police after some students of the Institute of Business Administration (IBA), which is located on the KU premises, complained on social media of an alleged harassment and intimidation incident on the campus.

The matter surfaced on the night between Wednesday and Thursday, when an IBA student, Syed Shaheer Ali, shared on Facebook that he was harassed in KU while he was returning after dropping one of the female students at the IBA Girls’ Hostel.

He alleged that around 10 young men, aged between 10 to 16 years, surrounded him on four motorcycles and harassed him.

Mr Ali said he dropped the female student at the Girls’ Hostel at around 11.30pm and then he along with a female friend headed towards Maskan, when 10 people on four motorcycles suddenly appeared and surrounded his car, shouting to get out of the vehicle.

The male student said it was pitch dark at KU, with complete silence and “we were stuck around the bushes. I tried my best to hold my nerves and pressed the accelerator to full as I tried to run away”, he wrote on social media.

“As we ran and reached near IBA Boys Hostel, they again appeared and surrounded us forcing me to stop the car. That’s when they came to the car’s window banging and screaming Larki ko Bahar nikaal, Gaari Roukk, Bahar aa... [take the girl out, stop the car, get off].”

However, Ali said he managed to escape and informed the security guards on the Maskan gate of the varsity.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1594881/underage-marriage-court-orders-arzoos-purported-husband-be-tried-for-rape,12/9/20 21:47,Underage marriage: Court orders Arzoo’s purported husband be tried for rape,"A judicial magistrate on Wednesday invoked offence of rape against the main suspect in a case pertaining to the alleged underage marriage of Arzoo — a teenage Christian girl who was allegedly abducted before being forcefully converted and married to a Muslim man.

The judge also ordered the registration of a case against Syed Ali Azhar, who is the girl's purported husband, as well as against cleric Qazi Abdul Rasool Naqshbandi, the justice of peace and facilitators and witnesses under Section 3 of the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act, 2013.

The magistrate also issued non-bailable arrest warrants for the absconding suspects. The judge sent the matter to the district and sessions’ judge (South) for initiating a trial.

During the hearing, the judge ruled that the investigation officer in the case was at liberty to determine the question of the issuance of sanad (certificate of conversion of religion) in accordance with the Supreme Court’s judgment (SCMR-474 of 2014), which was raised by the complainant’s counsel during the course of the arguments.

Police had booked Azhar, his brothers Syed Mohsin Ali and Syed Shariq Ali and their friend Danish for allegedly kidnapping the teenage girl, forcibly converting her and marrying her to a Muslim man.

Officials had also booked cleric Qazi Abdul Rasool, Junaid Ali Siddiqui and Mehmood Hassan for facilitating and solemnising the underage marriage of Arzoo Raja with Azhar. They are all currently on interim pre-arrest bail while Azhar is in police custody.

On Wednesday, judicial magistrate (South) Muhammad Ali Dall pronounced his verdict on the charge-sheet filed by the investigating officer after hearing arguments from the state prosecutor, defence counsel Muhammad Nizar Tanoli and the counsels for the complainant, Jibran Nasir and Asghar Narejo.

In his 20-page order, the judge noted that from perusal of the material available on record, it appeared that the ""ingredients"" of Section 376 (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Section 3 of the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act, 2013 were ""attracting"" against the suspect Syed Ali Azhar.

Section 3 states: “Whoever, being a male above eighteen years of age, contracts a child marriage shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment, which may extend to two years or with fine, which may extend to one hundred thousand rupees or with both.”

Similarly, the judge said that ""ingredients"" of Section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) of the PPC also ""attracted"" against Azhar.

He further wrote that in view of the facts, it appeared that ""ingredients"" of Section 4 (punishment for solemnising a child marriage) of the Child Marriage Act was ""attracting"" against Qazi Abdul Rasool Naqshbandi, who solemnised the couple’s marriage, Justice of Peace Muhammad Azharuddin, witnesses Muhammad Danish, Habib, Mahmood Hassan and Junaid Ali Siddiqui.

The magistrate accepted the charge-sheet filed by the investigation officer and took cognisance under Section 376 of the PPC and Section 3 of the SCMRA, 2013 against Azhar.

The magistrate also took cognisance under the Section 4 of the SCMRA, 2013 against the cleric Qazi Abdul Rasool Naqshbandi, Justice of Peace Muhammad Azharuddin, Muhammad Danish, Habib, Mahmood Hassan and Junaid Ali Siddiqui.

The judge further took cognisance under Section 201 of the PPC against Azhar.

However, the judge noted that since no evidence for initiating trial is available against the suspects Syed Shariq Ali and Danish, both were discharged from the case accordingly for the time being.

“Let the case be registered against Syed Ali Azhar, Qazi Abdul Rasool Naqshbandi, Justice of Peace Muhammad Azharuddin, Mahmood Hassan and Junaid Ali Siddiqui.” The magistrate sent the record of proceedings of the case to the District and Sessions’ Judge (South) for initiating trial.

Meanwhile, the court issued non-bailable warrants for the arrest of the absconding suspects, the Justice of Peace Muhammad Azharuddin and witnesses of the marriage ceremony, Danish and Habib.","['Naeem Sahoutara', 'Chrís Dăń', 'Bhai Saha', 'A Pakistani', 'Ali Mehdi', 'N.

However, the police said it was yet to be established whether the boy had been assaulted before being killed.","['house', 'torture', 'washroom', 'underconstruction', 'body', 'wazir', 'townhe', 'son', 'boy', 'suspected']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd337468dd26.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd315f65780d.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg', 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}",TRUE,http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'RAWALPINDI: Police found the body of an 11-year-old boy who had been missing since last Friday after leaving his...', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1537001', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Body of boy found', 'description': 'RAWALPINDI: Police found the body of an 11-year-old boy who had been missing since last Friday after leaving his...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1537001', 'title': 'Body of boy found', 'description': 'RAWALPINDI: Police found the body of an 11-year-old boy who had been missing since last Friday after leaving his...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-02-28 06:54:37', 'modified_time': '2020-02-28 06:54:37', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/397/the-newspaper-s-staff-reporter'}, 'author': ""The Newspaper's Staff Reporter""})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1590201/main-suspect-in-kashmore-mother-daughter-gang-rape-killed-by-accomplice-during-encounter-police,11/13/20 22:30,"Main suspect in Kashmore mother, daughter gang-rape 'killed by accomplice during encounter': police","The main suspect in the Kashmore gang-rape incident, who was arrested a day earlier, was killed on Friday by his accomplice in an alleged 'encounter' in Kashmore district near the RD-109 area of the Sindh-Balochistan border, police officials told Dawn.com.

According to Larkana Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Nasir Aftab, the main suspect, Rafique Malik, was ""killed by the firing of co-accused Khairullah Bugti while he was taken to point out a hideout of his co-accused"" in the jurisdiction of Bakhshapur Police Station.

Bugti was later arrested along with the ""rifle after exchange of firing"", DIG Aftab told Dawn.com via text message.

A day earlier, police had arrested Malik for allegedly subjecting a woman and her minor daughter to rape for two days after duping the former with a job offer in Kashmore district.

At the time, police had said they had arrested the suspect using a trap while an accomplice was still at large.

On Friday, DIG Aftab said that during interrogation, ""the accused Rafique Malik disclosed a secret hideout of the remaining accused Khairullah Bugti at a local dargah near Bakhshapur.""

""As soon as the accused Rafique Malik along with police reached at the spot, the co-accused Khairullah started firing in which Malik died and co-accused [was] arrested with weapons,"" the DIG added.

False promise

Malik was suspected of raping a mother and her five-year-old daughter for two days after duping them into travelling to Kashmore from Karachi.

Both the victims hail from Karachi, according to Kashmore police. The woman had met Malik at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) in Karachi nearly a week ago, when he had ""promised the woman that he would get her a job at Kashmore Toll Plaza and she readily agreed”, a policeman said.

The woman arrived in Kashmore over the past weekend and met Malik. Two days later, she approached Kashmore police, alleging that he had raped her after she reached his residence, and he then handed her over to another man — Khairullah Bugti — living near the Sindh-Balochistan border. That man also allegedly raped the woman, according to a police officer.

The woman told police that the suspect held her minor daughter hostage, saying he would only let her go when she brought him another woman from Karachi. According to police, the suspect also gave her some money to cover her travelling expenses.

The trap

Kashmore police then devised a ploy to nab the suspect.

“Our ASI (assistant sub-inspector) Mohammad Bux Buriro persuaded his wife to talk to the suspect over phone which she did. Then the woman from Karachi and the ASI’s daughter waited in a park in Kashmore where the suspect was scheduled to meet them,” said Kashmore Station House Officer (SHO) Akbar Channa.

As soon as the suspect arrived there, police apprehended him, according to the SSP. He then led police to a cattle pen where he had kept the young girl. “The girl told police that he had subjected her to criminal assault,” the police officer said.

He explained that the trap was arranged and police needed a woman for this purpose so the suspect would be tricked into thinking the victim had brought another woman as he had desired. “Otherwise it would have been difficult to lay hands on him,” he said.

A case was registered against the two men on Tuesday on the complaint of Kashmore police under Sections 376 (punishment of rape), 344 (wrongful confinement for ten or more days), 420 (cheating) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code. Besides the two suspects, one unidentified person was also nominated in the case by police.

Later on Thursday, SSP Kashmore Amjad Ali Shaikh had said that Bugti had also subjected the woman to rape but spared her daughter.","['Mohammad Hussain Khan', 'Imtiaz Ali', 'M.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1560469/gender-inequalities,6/1/20 7:51,Gender inequalities,"THE coronavirus pandemic is anti-feminist. This seems a strange statement given that evidence suggests that men are worse affected by Covid-19. But in terms of broader social and economic considerations, the pandemic globally is expected to set women back decades. Pakistan’s deeply entrenched misogyny means we’re unlikely to do eno­u­­gh, if anything at all, to stop this backward slide.

The pandemic affects women at multiple levels, starting with significant health imp­acts. Health workers — 70 per cent of whom worldwide are women — are among the most vulnerable to being infected by Covid-19. But the health toll for women extends beyond the coronavirus itself. Previous health crises, such as the Ebola epidemic, have shown that resources are typically diverted to lifesaving health measures from women’s health and reproductive services. The UN has already highlighted that Covid-19 will disrupt its programmes providing family planning support and countering female genital mutilation and child marriage, resulting in millions of unwanted pregnancies, higher maternal mortality rates for years to come, and millions more girls being cut.

The Covid-19 crisis has also put the spotlight on the frequency and intensity of do­­mestic violence around the world — the UN Population Fund in April estimated a 20pc increase in violence during a three-month lockdown period. One can only imagine how much higher this figure would be if accounting for permissive societal attitudes towards domestic violence in countries like Pakistan.

The immediate effect of the virus on women will be in terms of workforce participation. Societal expectations globally means women will be likelier to give up or be fired from jobs as they take on additional caring responsibilities for out-of-school children, the elderly and sick along with mounting housework. Sadly, in patriarchal societies such as ours, this trend will not even be perceived as problematic.

There are sad reminders of how deeply rooted misogyny is.

It doesn’t help that women’s current positioning within the global economy will force them to opt out faster than men. The ILO reports that globally women represent 40pc of total employment, but make up 57pc of the cadre of part-time workers; 69pc of low earners are women. In South Asia, over 80pc of women who don’t work in agriculture are in informal employment, including domestic work and piece-rate manufacturing jobs. These are the workers most likely to lose their jobs and fail to qualify for government job protection schemes.

Women in formal employment also dominate in sectors worst-hit by the pandemic: air travel, tourism, retail, hospitality, catering. Citigroup last month estimated that globally, 220 million women are in sectors vulnerable to massive job cuts.

This does not mean that women’s economic contribution is expendable. Citigroup has also estimated $1 trillion could be lost from global growth as a result of women falling out of the workforce. The cost will be palpable in places like Pakistan, where the labour underutilisation rate for women pre-pandemic was already as high as 80pc, and where the IMF has estimated GDP would increase by one-third if women’s labour participation equalled that of men.

The world — especially emerging economies like Pakistan — cannot afford the in­­e­v­itable gender inequalities and pay gap that will result from this pandemic. That’s why development agencies are urging governments to take a gender-sensitive appro­ach to managing the pandemic and its economic consequences. This means focusing on saving jobs in the health, education and hospitality sectors (that employ women) and not only in male-intensive sectors such as construction.

Governments are also being asked to extend support to informal, part-time and seasonal workers, who are mostly women, and revisit maternity, flexible working, and sick pay policies, which could help retain women in employment.

This is asking a lot in a country where the prime minister recently sat silently by while a cleric blamed immodest women for causing the pandemic by eliciting God’s wrath. Or where in March the Aurat March was accused of obscenity. Or where parliamentarians routinely use sexist and threatening language to address their peers.

Two social media scandals this week have been sad reminders of how deep-seated Pakistani misogyny is. One especially disgusting meme suggests that a property tycoon will give a model who has filed harassment charges against his daughters a plot in a residential development — the accompanying image is that of a grave. Another Twitter firestorm depicts rape as a punishment for adulterous women. Such casual references to gender-based homicide and sexual violence seem acceptable in our public sphere, and indicate the low stature of women in our society. The socioeconomic ravages of the pandemic layered over entrenched patriarchy threaten to designate women as a permanent under-class. Will our government take action to prevent this?

Updated 28 Apr 2020

Between 15 to 35 people end their lives in Pakistan every day.

That's as high as one person every hour.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that in 2012, the rate of suicide in Pakistan was 7.5 per 100,000 people. In other words, around 13,000 people killed themselves that year.

In 2016, the estimate was 2.9 per 100,000 i.e. over 5,500 ended their lives. Experts say the number of people dying is likely somewhere between the two figures, but the truth remains hidden.

This project hopes to end the silence by giving those who have suffered space to share their stories; by providing expert commentary and by providing access to a few resources the country has to offer those seeking help.

Let us open a dialogue about uncomfortable aspects of ourselves without shame. Let us be brave.

Losing our son

By Atiya Naqvi

Our son Emad died of a suicide on May 18, 2018 in Boston. He was working his dream job as a soccer coach in Boston. He had two FIFA licenses in coaching and was full of dreams and plans about his future. Emad was known for his wit and quirky humour and he was the life of a party amongst his very large circle of friends.

Emad with his mother, Atiya Naqvi, on his 21st birthday.

Our trip to Boston in a few hours is a harrowing blur of a long never ending flight where at times even the simple act of breathing was difficult. I was sure that my son had been a victim of foul play and so I and my husband were just grieving the injustice of our son losing his life just when everything seemed so promising and rosy.

However, once we got to Boston we were handed the note left behind by our son. It was clearly written in Emad’s own writing stating that this was a voluntary suicide and that he had left a video for his parents and two siblings on his phone to explain his reasons for ending his life.

Emad has left an almost two hour long video where he talks about his reasons for committing suicide.

He spoke about his teenage years when he was fat, when he was an average sports man, and an average student. He said he was always an A-grader but never an A-starrer. He says he felt he never made us proud and he was always someone who scraped through life in general. He said he always covered up his inadequacies with a wiseass attitude. He cited many examples of when he felt less than the others and every time we as parents were supportive of him he felt even worse for not being better than he was.

Emad as a coach with his players.

He went on to say that he started to feel different once he started to work as a soccer coach and changed his undergraduate major to pursue a career in soccer coaching. He said that he began to like himself and that he enjoyed the life he was now building for himself.

At the same time he couldn’t believe a mediocre person like him could achieve all that he had and so there had to be something wrong, which needed to be ended.

He ended the video by saying that he didn’t believe he was good enough, and that his current life of success and achievement was an illusion. He didn’t want this illusion to end and so he wanted to end his self-described “mediocre” life.

He was calm and loving throughout the video; there was no anxiety or fear on his face or in his demeanor. It was almost like a FaceTime conversation, except our beloved Emad was on longer on the other end of the phone. He couldn’t hear us sob or see the shock and devastation on our faces, he was gone — taking all his misguided beliefs of self-condemnations with him without realizing his worth.

In the months following my son’s passing I, his mother and a clinical psychologist, am now left with questions and no concrete answers.

A part of me died with Emad that day. As any mother would tell you, surviving your child’s death is a hell with no escape.

I struggle to think what the hardest part of my life is since my son left our world. The mornings when my eyes open to realize there is another interminable day ahead, my nights with no sleep till sheer exhaustion overtakes me, my responsibility towards my other two children, fear and self-doubt about myself as a mother, psychologist…. I could go on.

There is no end to this agony; at times I don't even want it to end as this is all I am left with.

In those dark hours, I turned to my training and then my faith. My training as a psychologist reconnected me back to my faith. After about three months of feeling utterly adrift in a dark space I returned to restructure my life. I read all I could about afterlife and grief, from a religious, psychological and spiritual perspective. I tried to accept my new reality without a fight, and replaced my WHY with a WHAT.

The new reality had no sleep, so I filled my nights with reading, praying and meditating. I worked on my own mental and physical health as best as I knew how. My friends and family were loving and supportive beyond imagination.

Emad at home with his family.

My life became about spending time with my husband and children. We valiantly tried to focus on Emad’s life and the person he was, instead of merely focusing on his last unfortunate choice. Each one of us tried to honour Emad’s life by devoting a part of our lives to carry his legacy.

My husband started Coach Emad Football Academy for underprivileged, but extremely talented children of Lyari. My daughter who is studying literature in Italy opted to write her thesis about death as she had experienced it. My youngest son joined his dad in organizing football matches at school levels to raise funds for the academy.

And I am raising awareness about suicide and depression by speaking openly about it in an environment where suicide is still a taboo topic. I am also in the process of starting support groups for grieving mothers so that broken and lost women like me can find ways to reconstruct our lives.

I have reflected long and hard on What happened to Emad and what might have been missed by me.

Where did we as parents go wrong? What are the causes of youth around the world caving into depression and suicide?

Emad never gave any signs of depression or even mood swings. He was always upbeat, helpful, and generally a very “good boy”. Yet all he believed was that he was just “not good enough”, he didn’t want to live the rest of his life as a mediocre person.

I feel it is very important for us as parents to start talking about OUR inadequacies. Let us do away with the dogma of perfectionism, competitiveness and overachievements and have an honest conversation about what roles and expectations we are creating.

We as parents have a language of validating achievements of our children and not the children themselves. The bars of achievements are getting higher and higher every day. The school systems are result-oriented and the average students slip through cracks unseen and unheard. These are the legacies that our youth are dumped with for the rest of their lives to carry. It is a heavy burden.

It is time to change the mindsets and language of us parents and our school systems. We have to look around our immediate environment of family, friends and colleagues and ask what kind of interaction did I have today? What did I see, hear and feel in each interaction? We simply cannot afford to know anything without experiencing it.

Each one of us will have to take responsibility for our interactions and communications in all our relationships that we care for. Let us take responsibility for our intrapersonal, interpersonal, professional and social interactions.

As a starter, if every parent, teacher, a friend is paying close, interested attention with empathy and compassion to those around us perhaps it might be easier for someone like Emad to open up and say he feels less than the others. Perhaps if the environment around our young people is less expectant, less judgmental they might not feel as if no matter what they do they haven’t made their parents proud.

The world is now a global village; there are unlimited opportunities of happy, healthy options of life. These options can seem out of their reach because our children are raised and educated mostly by adults of limiting beliefs.

Our next generation will benefit from growing in loving, acceptable environments in their homes, schools, workplaces and society in general so that they can make informed choices about their lives. They must have the space to make mistakes so they can learn; and our role can be to encourage, guide and support them to make newer and better choices.

Let us open a dialogue about uncomfortable aspects of ourselves without shame. Let us be brave and begin by holding genuine, trusting communications within our environment. It is time to stop pretending or wanting to be perfect. Let us work with Love and acceptance with the imperfect as our creator does with us.

Underlying many stories is a deep sense of isolation and shame, of suffering in silence, of fear of seeking help.

Dr's note

Murad Moosa Khan, Professor of Psychiatry at Aga Khan University

When Atika first contacted me for this project and explained she wanted me to review and comment on the testimonials in the section below, I didn't think it would be too much of an effort for me. After all, I have been practising psychiatry in Pakistan for more than a quarter of a century and had seen every type of mental disorder, of both genders, of all ages, from all sorts of backgrounds and from all parts of the country. And as suicide is my area of interest, one that I had been studying and researching for over 20 years, it would be interesting as well.

Little did I know what I was about to tread upon would be a window to the internal emotional struggles that so many Pakistanis are going through, without recourse to help. There were many who had no access to mental healthcare, others hesitated to seek help for fear of stigma, yet for others it was unaffordable.

The stories in the posts are extremely powerful and tell us what people in the highly complex and convoluted society of Pakistan are going through.

The testimonials are likely from the relatively well educated, English speaking, middle to upper-middle-class sections of the society. But reading about their struggles also gives us a clue what the not so well off in our society must be going through, with poverty, illiteracy, large family size, lack of space, drug use, unemployment and domestic violence all impacting their emotional health in ways one cannot even comprehend.

There are stories of bullying, of physical and sexual abuse, of rape, of domestic violence, of a toxic family atmosphere, of mental distress and of course, of self-harm and suicide. It is surprising how many of the more than 3,000 responses that were received, had either thoughts of suicide, had carried out self-harm acts themselves or knew of someone in their family or circle of friends, who had died by suicide.

Underlying many of these stories was a deep sense of isolation and shame, of suffering in silence, of fear of seeking help due to stigma or being judged.

The stories tell us how, under the veneer of socio-cultural and religious values, all kinds of ills — from rape to betrayal to bullying and drug use — exist in an ostensibly sanitised society. They tell us how the lack of education (not only literacy), of an organised health system and of law and justice put so many young Pakistanis at risk and affecting their mental health. The stories also tell us about the lack of mental health services in the country, the poor training, and poor ethical and professional standards of many of our mental health professionals and of the shame and stigma attached to seeking help for mental health problems.

The stories also tell us about the incredible resiliency of many Pakistanis, as they fight against insurmountable odds of the society and, at times their families, to not only survive but progress in life as well.

There are many unsung heroes in this country. Some are among those who have written in.

For years, we have witnessed neglect of social development in the country; of housing and transport, of health and education, of law and order, of justice. This has resulted in a population that is highly mentally distressed, with extremely high levels of stress. Some of this stress is played out on our roads, in our homes, in extreme kinds of behaviours including suicide and terrorism.

There is an urgent need to address the many ills in this society. We need to address the upstream factors such as social factors as well as downstream factors such as more and better mental health facilities, including suicide prevention activities. This is a human rights issue.

The people of this country deserve it.

Suicide does not happen in a vacuum. There is a 'suicidal pathway' that people get on, which may start weeks or months before the event.

http://www.dawn.com/news/1061730/proper-medical-facilities-for-women-stressed,12/11/13 7:22,Proper medical facilities for women stressed,"KARACHI, Dec 10: Experts at a seminar on ‘Women’s right to life and health’ said on Tuesday that denying proper medical facilities to women, which in many cases resulted in abortions or maternal deaths, was a serious violation of human rights.

To mark World Human Rights Day, the seminar was jointly organised by the Pakistan Medical Association’s Karachi chapter and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecoligists of Pakistan (SOGP) at the PMA House.

“The condition of pregnant women is extremely poor in many parts of the world, particularly in the Third World, where they are dying or suffering abortions because of miserable facilities and understanding,” said Dr Donia Nilofar Khan, an expert on women’s health.

She said women in the developing countries had no right to decide about their fate during pregnancies, which coupled with difficult terrains and lack of transport often resulted in their deaths.

“In the rural parts of Pakistan, particularly in Sindh and Balochistan, 70 per cent of women have no access to health facilities on time,” she said, adding that those lucky ones who somehow got to any health outlet found miserably insufficient assistance.”

Dr Nighat Shah of the SOGP cited a recent study that particularly in the rural areas more than 50 per cent pregnant women were victims of domestic violence and in many such cases they had to suffer abortion.

She called for a pro-women school syllabus and declaration of education for women a priority.

Dr Shershah Syed spoke about the prevalent misogynistic attitude in society in which women continued to be dependent on the whims of man.

“A pregnant woman is forced for abortion if the family knows the sex of the foetus. Females have always been declared unwanted by our society at large,” he said. He said he often saw gunfire in jubilation by the families when a boy was born but in the case of a girl he heard deafening sighs.

Erum Farooque, a Muttahida Qaumi Movement member of the Sindh Assembly, bemoaned the dominant feudal system in Pakistan. However, she said the provincial assembly had passed several pro-women laws, which would help a lot in future to change the game.

Dr Qazi Wasiq, general secretary of the PMA Karachi, concluded the programme with a note of thanks.","[""The Newspaper'S Staff Reporter"", 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/796504/un-blames-rise-in-violence-against-afghan-women-on-culture,3/19/13 11:08,UN blames rise in violence against Afghan women on culture,"Afghan women clad in burqa walk up a hill at the old part of Kabul, May 10, 2012. — Photo by Reuters

UNITED NATIONS: Violence linked to culture was the main reason for a 20 per cent rise in deaths and injuries of females in Afghanistan last year, UN special envoy to Afghanistan Jan Kubis said on Monday.

Despite an overall fall in annual civilian casualties in Afghanistan for the first time in several years, the United Nations said last month that more than 300 women and girls were killed and more than 560 injured during 2012.

“The majority is linked to domestic violence, tradition, culture of the country,” Kubis told reporters at the United Nations in New York ahead of a debate on Afghanistan by the UN Security Council on Tuesday.

“Of course there are very clearly attacks on women's activists by the insurgency,” he said. “Then there are unfortunate situations when indeed women are killed while doing their daily chores (by unexploded bombs).”

Western human rights advocates say cultural tradition is often used to justify abuse of women such as female genital mutilation and honor killings. Afghanistan is a conservative Muslim country, where under Taliban rule between 1996 and 2001 women were forced to cover up and were banned from voting, most work and leaving their homes unless accompanied by a husband or male relative.

US-backed Afghan forces toppled the Taliban in late 2001 for refusing to hand over Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after the Sept 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.

As foreign forces prepare to withdraw by the end of 2014 after a more than decade-long war, the United Nations and rights groups are concerned human rights in Afghanistan, particularly those of women, will further deteriorate.

Afghan women have won back basic rights in education, voting and employment since the Taliban were ousted from power in 2001, but fears are mounting that such freedoms could be traded away as Kabul seeks peace talks with the group.

Activists and some lawmakers have blamed the rise in violence against women on what they say is waning interest in women's rights on the part of Afghan President Hamid Karzai's government, a claim Karzai denies.

The UN political mission in Afghanistan, led by Kubis, said in December that Afghanistan still had a long way to go in implementing the 2009 Law on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which made child marriage, forced marriage, rape and other violent acts criminal offenses.

“Our role as the UN will be very crucial in the post-2014 period,” Kubis said on Monday. “We will be one of the promoters, advocates of what should be practices in a country that will be perhaps more traditional and will be coming back to its roots.”

“The situation is of concern and will remain of concern,” he said of violence against women and girls.

Women who pursue careers in conservative Afghanistan routinely face opposition in a society where often they are ostracized - or worse - for mixing with men other than husbands or relatives.

A UN policy-making body agreed on Friday to a declaration urging an end to violence against women and girls despite concerns from conservative Muslim countries and the Vatican about references to women's sexual and reproductive rights.","['Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1174188,4/6/15 6:31,"Repeated unintended pregnancies in poor, illiterate women endangering lives","KARACHI: It’s not the worry of getting pregnant for the ninth time and that, too, at the age of 40, which has brought Ms Gul to the gynaecology department of the Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK). Rather, it’s a feeling of acute weakness that forced her to seek medical help.

Waiting for her turn in a crowded ward, she appears troubled and lost. “Since I have gotten pregnant almost a month ago, I have been feeling too much tiredness and anxiety. I don’t even have the energy to force myself to work and feel guilty that I am neglecting my youngest child who is just three years old,” she says worryingly.

Take a look: Beyond Hunger

Married to a man with low income at an early age, Ms Gul regrets that often her husband has to borrow money to make ends meet. Lack of financial resources also deprived her children of getting school education.

Replying to a question about how the couple would meet the needs of another baby and whether the couple really wanted an addition to their family at this time, she said: “It’s God who brings every soul in this world and feeds all His creations. But, yes, it’s not a wanted pregnancy as we didn’t have the desire for more children.”

Sitting on the bench next to her is 35-year-old Razia, expecting her sixth child. Her son, the eldest among the siblings, is 20 years old. “Getting pregnant at an age when you have adult children is quite embarrassing,” she says with a sheepish smile on her face.

Both women, one residing in Landhi and the other in Lyari, have had their experiences with contraceptives that, they say, did help in bringing some gap between births but they discontinued their use after some time. The reason in one case was linked to some side-effects of a birth control method while the other reported contraceptive failures. Their husbands, however, never showed the willingness to use any birth-spacing method.

At the CHK gynaecology out-patient department, according to the staff, around 200 to 250 women daily report, an overwhelming majority of them are poor, pregnant and anaemic.

In the same out-patient ward waiting for her turn to see a doctor is a young woman from Orangi. Looking pale and exhausted, Ms Rukhsana, a health worker, is pregnant with her third child in four years at the age of 20. “I feel I have lost 50pc of my energy levels. At times I have difficulty in breathing, too,” she tells Dawn.

She recalls that she used to have fits due to high blood pressure during her first pregnancy and that she lost one of her twin babies at that time. The one who survived remained weak and still is. “After my second delivery, I asked my husband whether I could use any contraceptive methods, but he strongly rejected the idea, saying that it’s against our tradition and values,” she recounts.

Poverty and pregnancy

The brief stories of these women offer a glimpse into the lives of millions of Pakistani mothers, a majority of them are either completely illiterate or semi-literate and belong to a class that barely earn enough to survive.

Repeated pregnancies without adequate space between births, according to experts, not only endanger life of mother and baby, but also deprive these women of enjoying motherhood in its true sense. Women burdened by large families and battling various illnesses in their productive years fail to realise and harness their potential and are unable to raise their children in a healthy environment.

Pakistan with one of the highest maternal and child mortality rates in the world also faces the challenge of increasing population and is currently the sixth most populous country. These issues are directly linked to a lack of use of family planning methods.

According to a recent study conducted by the Population Council (a non-governmental organisation), there were approximately nine million pregnancies in 2012 in Pakistan, of which 4.2m pregnancies were unintended. Of these unintended pregnancies, 54pc resulted in induced abortions (Sindh and Balochistan had the highest share) and 34pc in unplanned births.

It also says that the proportion of unintended pregnancies rose from 38pc in 2002 to 46pc in 2012 which indicates that contraceptive use have not kept pace with growing desire for smaller families. The decline in the number of births in the country has been slower than in other Asian countries.

Women in Pakistan, it states, have a high level of unmet need for contraception estimated at 20pc in 2012-2013. Contraceptive use — including both traditional and modern methods — has risen slowly from 30pc in 2007 to 35pc in 2013. Among women who use any method, the discontinuation rate within one year of use is high.

“When I ask women whether they discuss with their husbands about the number of children they should have, they look at me with surprise and reply how they could interfere in God’s work,” Dr Nusrat Shah, senior gynaecologist serving as an associate professor at the Dow University of Health Sciences-CHK, shares how women respond to family planning issues.

‘Family planning saves life’

“Family planning is the first pillar of safe motherhood. Although it’s the responsibility of doctors to educate and encourage women, especially those who are admitted for a delivery, to use contraceptives, most of us don’t do their job properly,” Dr Shah admits.

She believes that the major reason why people avoid using contraceptives is because they consider it un-Islamic. “I think the media and the government can play a major role in dispelling wrong concepts. No religion says that a woman should bear a child if she is mentally and physically unhealthy. The religious scholars should also promote birth-spacing as it encourages women’s and children’s health,” she adds.

The second obstacle, she thinks, are the many myths and misconceptions surrounding the use of contraceptives. “Women need to know that side-effects are easy to manage and there are contraceptives that provide birth control support for a long period and are much safer. Failures often occur in birth control pills when the required dose is not taken at the right time,” she explains.

On cases of unsafe abortion, she said that the number of women coming with post-abortion complications at the CHK had significantly reduced.

“Thankfully, the occurrence of unsafe surgical termination of pregnancy has reduced in recent years. It’s likely due to the easy availability of the medication being used to induce abortion. But, the right way is not let the pregnancy happen in the first place,” she says.

Seconding her opinion, Dr Halima Yasmin working as a gynaecology consultant at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre said that there was a need for a study to look into the causes of a drop in cases of unsafe abortion.

“Not only the numbers have dropped at our hospital, but also the nature of complications has changed from very severe and severe to mild. For instance, now women in such cases report with mild sepsis,” she said.

The police officer investigating the case appeared before a judicial magistrate at Model Town courts and sought remand of suspects Sunny Khan and Bisma for further interrogation.

Johar Town Investigation In-charge Imran Yaseen said Bisma was still insisting she killed her daughter Manahil and son Yousaf on her own in a fit of dejection caused by domestic rows.

He said the police initially established that the car with a ruling party MNA logo found parked inside the suspects’ house was in use of a cousin of Sunny who currently lived in Saudi Arabia.

He denied Bisma had accused her husband of forcing her to visit a Gulf state as part of ‘cultural troupe’ or he forced her to get her second pregnancy aborted.

Bisma’s father Tahir, a resident of Johar Town insisted that his son-in-law had tried to send his daughter aboard along with some other girls a year ago but she resisted and shifted to her parents’ house for a few months over the issue.

Tahir alleged that Sunny and his mother forced Bisma for abortion before the birth of her second child. He said Sunny would also force Bisma to fetch money from her parents.

He said Bisma had told him a day before the incident that Sunny’s mother and her sisters wanted to throw the couple out of the house.","[""The Newspaper'S Staff Reporter"", 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1464717,2/19/19 7:08,Women seek abortions as birth control,"PESHAWAR: Pregnant, desperate, and poor, Zameena faced a stark choice: risk her life by having a secret abortion, or risk her life bearing her husband a sixth child.

In the end, she opted for the former, one of more than two million women a year to do so in a country where religious leaders are critical of family planning measures and there is a lack of sex education and access to contraception.

Explore: Why does Pakistan have low contraception and high abortion rates?

Almost half of all pregnancies in Pakistan — around 4.2 million each year — are unplanned and around 54 per cent of those end in termination, according to a report by US research firm Guttmacher Institute.

“Three years ago, when my daughter was born, the doctor told me that I should stop having babies because it would be bad for my health,” said Zameena, using an assumed name, from her home in Peshawar.

“But whenever I say that to my husband, he tells me to trust God,” the 35-year-old added. “My husband is a religious man... he wants to have a line of sons.”

Decades ago, a family planning campaign with the slogan ‘do bache hi ache’ or “two children are good” was rejected by religious leaders as well as nationalists who wanted a bigger population to rival the 1.2 billion people in India.

Today with a population of around 207m, the country’s baby boom is stretching resources beyond capacity and experts warn of trouble ahead.

Zameena said she frequently suggested to her husband that they practise family planning, but he refused.

“My mother-in-law had nine kids,” said Zameena. “When I complain to my husband that I can’t have more babies, he answers: ‘If my mother didn’t die, you should also stay alive’.”

Abortion is allowed in Pakistan if the health of the mother is in danger.

But many doctors invoke their faith and refuse to carry them out.

As a result, some women abort illegally and authorities largely turn a blind eye to the situation.

IVF clinics — in business big time

The preferred method is by ingesting Misoprostol, an over-the-counter drug used to treat ulcers, which causes the expulsion of the embryo. It can also cause serious complications for the mother. Aware Girls, an NGO, counsels those who call its hotline on how such drugs should be used safely and when to seek emergency or professional treatment at a clinic.

“Most of us know women who have died of an abortion,” said Aware Girls co-founder.

‘Willing to do anything’

Zameena was one of the lucky ones — she knew where to go for help once she decided to terminate her latest pregnancy.

At the other end of the Aware Girls hotline, counsellor Ayeesha reassured and advised her on what medicines to take and in which dosage.

They insist that women must never be alone when they attempt such procedures.

“My work saves women’s lives. When they call, they are willing to do anything to have an abortion,” explained the 26-year-old.

Ayeesha estimated that she fields around 350 calls a month. Most women who contact the NGO know very little about contraception. Access to condoms, the most well-known option, is limited and even when they can be bought, it requires the man to agree.

According to official statistics, only around 35pc of Pakistani women use any form of non-abortive birth control despite them being inexpensive.

Birth control pills cost just 20 rupees, for example, while an IUD (intrauterine device) is available for 400 rupees.

But population control is a controversial issue in Pakistan, where large families are prized.

“Authorities have not been able to make this issue an emergency for Pakistan. It is all rhetoric and political gibberish,” says Dr Haroon Ibrahim of the family planning NGO Greenstar.

Zeba Sathar, a demographer in charge of another NGO, the Population Council, branded the nation’s negative attitude to contraception a “systemic failure”.

‘Women are dying’

Prime Minister Imran Khan in December acknowledged the lack of political will on the issue and promised pro-contraception campaigns using the media, mobile phones, schools and mosques.

“The mullahs have a key role to play,” he insisted.

But the Council of Islamic Ideology says otherwise, insisting that family planning is against Islam.

“The birth control campaign at the government level should be immediately stopped and the birth control programme should be removed from the economic planning,” the council told AFP.

The charity Marie Stopes, whose clinics provide post-abortion care, has profiled a typical client in Pakistan: aged in her thirties, married at 18, she is poor, uneducated and already has three children. Such women approach the agency when backstreet abortions go wrong.

“Women are just dying... for the lack of knowledge,” said Xaher Gul, an executive at Marie Stopes.

In 2012, the year of their last study, the Guttmacher Institute estimated there were 2.25m abortions in Pakistan with 623,000 women treated for post-abortion complications.

“We have failed women in this country,” warned Hassan Mohtashami, former head of the United Nations Development Programme in Pakistan.

He added: “Abortion is not a family planning method.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1307189,1/8/17 19:26,Allegedly tortured child maid recovered from Islamabad's suburbs: sources,"The juvenile housemaid allegedly tortured by the family of an Islamabad additional district and sessions judge, has been recovered, police sources told DawnNews.

Police sources said that the girl Tayyaba was recovered from a house in the suburb area of Islamabad.

Meanwhile, Islamabad police officials are reluctant to either confirm or deny the development, saying that the matter is sub judice so they are unable to comment over the issue.

The 10-year-old had been working as a domestic servant at the house additional judge in Islamabad when she was recovered by police 24 hours after a neighbour complained that Tayyaba was being severely mistreated by the couple.

The judge and his wife were facing an inquiry for their alleged involvement in keeping the juvenile housemaid in wrongful confinement, burning her hand over a missing broom, beating her with a ladle, detaining her in a storeroom and threatening her with dire consequences, when a person claimed to be the father of Tayyaba appeared before a court of law and forgave the accused.

The Supreme Court (SC) had on Friday ordered DNA tests to confirm the identity of the parents of the 10-year-old child maid who was allegedly tortured by her employers ─ an influential judge and his wife ─ and ordered a full police probe into the allegations.

The court took suo motu notice of the case after the girl's parents 'forgave' her alleged tormentors. The location of the child is presently unknown.

Adding to the confusion, two women previously unheard of appeared before the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Mian Saqib Nisar in court today, each claiming the girl in question is their child, after which the judge requested DNA tests.

CJP Nisar, who is heading a two-member bench hearing the suo motu case, remarked, ""No 'agreements' can be reached in matters concerning fundamental human rights.""

""Even parents cannot deny children their fundamental rights,"" the judge observed. ""How did they reach a settlement on torture against the child?""

'Definitely tortured'

Pims Vice Chancellor Dr Javed Akram said there was no doubt the child had been tortured.

""During her first visit to the hospital, the child claimed she was burnt while trying to switch on the television. But the wounds indicated that a hot iron rod had been placed on her arm,"" he said.","['Shakeel Qarar', 'Miqbal Rangoonwala', 'Syed Waqar Ali', 'Objective View', 'Dr. Salaria', 'Aamir Ahmad', ""Gerry D'Cunha"", 'Mansoor Ali Khan', 'Asif A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1408478,5/18/18 16:20,What recourse do students have when they are sexually harassed in schools?,"Jurisprudence, or better yet legislative action akin to Workplace Harassment Act, needs to be implemented in schools.

Last week, numerous female students in Karachi spoke out on social media against sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour that they have had to face in schools at the hands of their peers, teachers and administrators.

The wave of first-hand testimonies seemed to crystallise into a demand by the students to have proper sexual harassment policies in schools.

This would be an opportune moment to look at the laws that exist in the country in this regard, where they fall short, and what can be done to plug the gaps.

Subjecting children to adult ordeals

There are various federal and provincial laws in Pakistan to promote children's well being, but legislation to protect children from sexual abuse in schools is lacking.

Currently, a child who has been a victim of sexual harassment or molestation at school by a peer or by their teacher or caretaker only has recourse to generic provisions of criminal law against the direct perpetrator of such an act.

The Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) applies to the entire country and it addresses sexual harassment in a broader spectrum. Section 509 of the PPC criminalises sexual harassment and sexual advances by any person against a victim, independent of setting.

Recently, through the Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Act of 2016, Section 377-A of the PPC was inserted to criminalise sexual abuse on persons less than 18 years of age.

Therefore, whenever a child suffers sexual abuse in the confines of their school, they have no choice but to file a claim directly against the accused under the provisions of criminal law and procedure.

Related: Sexual harassment: Pakistan's tipping point?

Never mind the emotional trauma underlying reporting such a claim, a child (through a representative) would have to lodge an FIR under the applicable provision of the PPC and/or provincial law on sexual abuse at the police station in order to charge the accused.

Additionally, the child would ordinarily record their statement under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

The FIR would have to be promptly lodged without delay, otherwise the case would be prejudiced.

Furthermore, documentary and/or ocular evidence would generally be required to validate the contents of the claim.

This would be followed by a full-fledged trial, in which evidence would be recorded, witnesses and experts would be called upon and cross-examined to verify the contents of the claims.

The victims, through the trial, would essentially undergo the ordeal of suffering losing their privacy, having their credibility challenged and potentially become targets of abuse and stigmatisation.

All the while, the one party who in theory should be most responsible for ensuring the child's safety is spared by the operations of the aforementioned laws: the child’s school and its administration.

Unprotected children

There is no particular provision of law that criminalises neglect or oversight by caretakers in sexual harassment against children.

At best, a school may be culpable under Section 328-A of the PPC (also recently inserted by the legislature), whereby whoever does an act of omission that has the potential to harm the child by causing physical or psychological injury may be punished with imprisonment of up to one year.

However, the evidentiary requirements would be the same as above, and the victim would have to undergo the torment of criminal proceedings and trial to substantiate their claims.

Civil remedies against a school for negligence can range from filing a claim for negligent hiring or vicarious liability. Such civil causes of actions are rarely filed.

Schools are workplaces too

The one legislative instrument that keeps in view the ground realities of reporting sexual harassment and accommodates victims is the Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act of 2010 (Workplace Harassment Act).

The Workplace Harassment Act specifically addresses the issue of women (and men) in the workplace facing harassment in an abusive working environment.

Section 2(h) of the Act defines harassment as ""any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favours or other verbal or written communication or physical conduct of a sexual nature.""

The Act provides a comprehensive system on how workplace harassment should be reported and dealt with internally by an organisation. ""Organisation"" includes educational institutes such as schools.

Every organisation within the ambit of the Act is required to form an internal committee to review and adjudicate complaints of harassment by an employer and/or employee against an employee.

Read next: Special report: Sexual harassment in workplaces in Pakistan

The Act goes a long way in shielding victims from the mental turmoil of providing detailed proof by shifting the evidentiary burden of ascertaining the facts upon the Inquiry Committee and the accused instead of the victim.

The Act empowers victims with the tools to confront the offender and provides a level playing field, unlike the marred criminal trial proceedings under the Criminal Procedure Code and the Evidence Act.

Sexual harassment in the workplace, however, is not confined to the world of adults. Children also experience harassment and abuse in their workplace: their schools.

Unfortunately, the Workplace Harassment Act does not extend its procedural cover to children at schools.

Without statutory law regulating schools in this regard, the current model of schools acting on their own whims provides aesthetic relief at best.

This gives a false sense of improvement and is largely unenforceable, thereby not making a classroom a more secure place for children.

Need of the hour

In Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, the United States Supreme Court held that a student deserves protection from sexual harassment by a teacher just as an employee does from harassment by a supervisor.

Public school students in the US who are sexually abused by school persons have the option of bringing a claim of sexual harassment under statutes normally reserved for workplace harassment against employees.

Jurisprudence, or better yet legislative action akin to the Workplace Harassment Act, needs to be implemented in schools.

This would not only combat harassment against children in educational institutions, but also protect children from the stigma of going through a full-fledged trial proceeding, which often due to socio-economic, legal and cultural factors ends up empowering the status quo instead of providing justice.

A central purpose of law is to protect the weak from the strong. Unfortunately, we have neglected the weakest class — children — in their most vulnerable setting: school.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1410205,5/27/18 6:56,Footprints: Losing daughters,"PAKISTAN usually features in the headlines of Italian media for stories related to terrorism and religious extremism, but that hasn’t been the case lately. It is, instead, stories of violence against women that have brought the land of the pure under the spotlight once again. Stories that depict an image of Pakistani women as weak victims, abused and tortured physically and mentally by patriarchal families and a compliant society.

If you ask anyone in Italy if they know any famous Pakistani women, they won’t hesitate in naming Malala Yousafzai, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, Benazir Bhutto or Asma Jahangir. If you ask them to name one famous Pakistani man, they’ll struggle to think of any. Yet, the image people in Italy have of Pakistan is one dominated by the narrative built around cases of violence against women that have emerged, in particular, over the past few weeks.

It leads Italians to look down on Pakistani culture, tradition, and, worst of all, the people, making the process of integration even harder.

It began with Sana Cheema’s murder, the 25-year-old Italian-Pakistani from Brescia who, last month, was allegedly strangled by her father and brother for refusing to marry of their will. Sana’s story had a lot of similarities with the story of another Pakistani girl from the same city, Hina Saleem, who was murdered and buried in the backyard of her family’s home for being “too western” back in 2006.

The latest in the series is the story of Farah Tanveer, a 19-year-old, who spent her entire adolescence in Verona, the city home to the world’s most famous love story — Romeo and Juliet. And just like Romeo and Juliet, the main obstacle to her love was her family. Farah got pregnant by an Italian-Colombian boy her age out of wedlock, was taken to Pakistan and forced to have an abortion by her family.

“They drugged me, tied me to a bed and forced me to have an abortion,” Farah messaged her friends in Italy, while asking for help, just days before the Italian government urged Pakistan to find and rescue the girl before it was too late. Pakistani police raided her Islamabad home last week and took her to the residence of the Italian ambassador, who then helped coordinate her return to Italy.

Her picture has been on the front page of every mainstream Italian newspaper since about a week now and her “liberation” is being celebrated as a huge success. As always happens in such cases, the “West” and “Italy” become symbols of “freedom” and “respect of human rights” and Pakistan of a “misogynistic culture” and “closed religious mentality”.

Western media has mostly been painting Muslims as enemies since 9/11 attacks, so it’s easier to reinforce this narrative, rather than challenge it, and when stories like that of Farah’s emerge, Islam is brought back into the discussion. Is Islamic culture compatible with European values? Can you be Italian and Muslim at the same time?

These are the questions many newspapers are trying to answer, while forgetting that violence against women is a common problem that has little to do with religion. According to official figures, one third of women in Italy have experienced some form of physical or sexual violence and a woman is murdered every three days in the country, but all this doesn’t seem to matter to public opinion when compared to the ordeal of second-generation Muslim girls.

The latest statistics published by the national newspaper La Repubblica reveal that there are 300,000 Muslims under the age of 15, and 150,000 between the ages of 15 and 24 in Italy. Half of them are girls. The families of these girls come from Pakistan, Morocco, Egypt and Bangladesh, to name a few, and often have rural backgrounds. It’s hard to predict how many of these girls will choose to live a life their families won’t approve of, how many will give into the pressure of their parents, how many will be happy to embrace their family’s traditions and how many will be forced to comply with them.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1574682/second-death-in-two-weeks-polio-claims-14-year-old-boys-life,8/16/20 7:50,Second death in two weeks: Polio claims 14-year-old boy’s life,"LAHORE: A second polio-related death was reported in the city within two weeks after a 14-year-old boy died of the crippling disease at Mayo Hospital.

Talha of Ravi Town had died on July 27, two days after he was declared a suspected case of polio. The National Institute of Health (NIH) and the Punjab health authorities confirmed it on Saturday while officially notifying the death.

Earlier, 26-month-old Muhammad Ali had died of the disease at Children Hospital on July 14, an official privy to the information told Dawn.

This was the third death from polio in Punjab, which was also confirmed by the provincial government in a statement issued late on Saturday.

One of his immediate contacts also found infected with virus

The official said that all four limbs of Ali were paralysed and he had suffered a stroke which led to his death.

He was also a resident of Ravi Town, a health department spokesman, told Dawn.

He said Talha’s death was officially confirmed after health teams traced two minor girls, who were his immediate contacts, and found one of them infected with the same virus.

Referring to the NIH report, the spokesperson said that when Talha was shifted to the Government Said Mitha Hospital here on July 25, doctors declared him a suspected patient of poliovirus.

“The child was fine till he developed fever along with vomiting followed by gradual weakness of both the lower limbs,” the report reads.

It stated that the boy was later notified as suffering from Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) with provisional diagnosis of Guillain Barre Syndrome, the most common cause of AFP in healthy infants and children.

He was shifted to Mayo Hospital where his condition became critical due to difficulty in breathing and the weakness in upper limbs progressed, the report further stated. Talha was then shifted to the Covid-19 intensive care unit and placed on a ventilator where he died on July 27.

Meanwhile, health teams managed to trace the immediate contacts of Talha -- Noor Fatima and her younger sister from Ravi Town. The NIH report stated that Noor Fatima was fully immunised and had received the last dose of polio vaccine on March 18; the girls did not have a significant travel history. It, however, confirmed that she carried the poliovirus in her body, while the test reports of her sister were awaited.

Earlier on July 9, a six-month-old boy had succumbed to the disease in Taunsa Sharif.

Polio campaigns had remained suspended for three months due to Covid-19. However, the Punjab polio programme in-charge, Sundas Irshad, said in a statement on Saturday: “As a response, polio campaigns have been restarted to save more children from the virus. Monthly campaigns will ensure that the virus is eliminated this year.”

She urged parents to get their children vaccinated.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1584688,10/12/20 19:35,Main suspect in motorway gang-rape case arrested from Faisalabad,"The main suspect of the Lahore-Sialkot motorway gang-rape case, Abid Malhi, was arrested by police on Monday, police officials confirmed.

Abid was arrested from Faisalabad and is being shifted to Lahore, Hasnain Haider, a deputy superintendent (DSP) of the Crime Investigation Agency (CIA), said.

The arrest comes a little over a month after the incident, that had sparked outrage across the country.

The development was confirmed in a tweet by prime minister's special assistant Shahbaz Gill, who said that the suspect will be punished according to law.

Last month, two robbers on the Lahore-Sialkot motorway had gang-raped a mother of two in front of her children in an area falling within the Gujjarpura police jurisdiction. The incident caused a countrywide outpouring of anger and brought sexual violence against women into national focus. Abid and Shafqat Ali alias Bagga — who is on judicial remand— are the main suspects in the case.

Abid, who was leading a gang of four, is also wanted to police in at least 10 other criminal cases registered at various police stations of Punjab.

The news was welcomed by President Arif Alvi, who termed the arrest ""a matter of national relief"".

""An efficient trial of the accused and the 'severest exemplary' punishment possible under the law must be given to all those found guilty,"" the president said in a tweet. ""Let everyone feel safe in Pakistan, specially our women and children.""

Case details

Shafqat, whose arrest was announced by Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, was sent to prison on a 14-day judicial remand by an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore a day after he was detained by the police.

Shafqat was arrested after the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Police raided a house in Okara district. He confessed to the crime before his DNA matched the samples collected from the crime scene.

A senior officer had told Dawn that the CTD carried out an intelligence-based operation (IBO) and arrested Shafqat from his sister’s house in Depalpur. He further said that Abid had called Shafqat many times before and after committing the rape.

During interrogation, Shafqat told detectives that Abid had first raped the woman and then asked him to commit the offence while threatening him that he would shoot him (Shafqat) for not committing the crime or showing sympathy for the victim.

As they had just raped the woman, they noticed the personnel of the Dolphin Squad reaching the spot, the official said. As soon as a Dolphin official fired a warning shot into the air, both the suspects fled the scene and hid in a nearby jungle of Karol Ghati for two hours or so to avoid arrest. Then they left the place and reached Sheikhupura at the home of Abid Ali at Ghazi Kot, Qila Sattar Shah, in tehsil Ferozewala of Sheikhupura district. Abid had purchased this two-marla house some three years back.

Both Abid and Shafqat turned their mobile phones off. Shafqat left Abid’s house and reached Depalpur where he was employed at a cold storage. As more news of the crime appeared in the media, he preferred to stay away from his workplace and hid himself in the house of his sister who was probably unaware of his involvement in the crime, the officer informed Dawn. Abid also fled his house and went underground to avoid arrest when he came to know about the massive media coverage.

The third suspect, identified as Iqbal alias Bala, was “arrested” on the information provided by Shafqat during interrogation, an official had told Dawn. The official said he was not directly involved in the rape case, but being an active member of the gang he might disclose possible hideouts of Abid.

A fourth suspect, Waqarul Hasan, had surrendered to police while claiming his innocence and requested the authorities to conduct his DNA test to corroborate his claim.

The Lahore police reportedly released relatives and friends of two other suspects — Waqarul Hassan and his brother in-law Abbas — who were detained in connection with the case.","['Abdul Khalique', 'Free Expression', 'Ahsan Gul', 'Pakistan Zindabad', 'Azam', 'Ali Da Malanga', 'Bharat', 'French Fries', 'Chrís Dăń', 'Sabir Shah']","The main suspect of the Lahore-Sialkot motorway gang-rape case, Abid Malhi, was arrested by police on Monday, police officials confirmed.

The third suspect, identified as Iqbal alias Bala, was “arrested” on the information provided by Shafqat during interrogation, an official had told Dawn.","['house', 'arrest', 'arrested', 'faisalabad', 'main', 'suspect', 'case', 'shafqat', 'motorway', 'told', 'official', 'suspects', 'crime', 'gangrape', 'abid']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189f00b83e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0d52ba8a43.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/09/5f5f70fd35347.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/09/5f59e90d7f094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/09/5f59e90d7f094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21824a8678.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/10/5f846dd3b6857.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189916390d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0ec56aad75.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd22283a73d3.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18a3ece187.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/10/5f846dd3b6857.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/09/5f6369841b350.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f94d8916a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/09/5f6369841b350.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f4142e469.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24c3aad888.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24e90196c5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/09/5f5f70fd35347.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/10/5f846dd3b6857.png,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': ""Abid Malhi's arrest comes a month after the incident took place."", 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1584688', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Main suspect in motorway gang-rape case arrested from Faisalabad', 'description': ""Abid Malhi's arrest comes a month after the incident took place."", 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/10/5f846dd3b6857.png'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1584688', 'title': 'Main suspect in motorway gang-rape case arrested from Faisalabad', 'description': ""Abid Malhi's arrest comes a month after the incident took place."", 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/10/5f846dd3b6857.png'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-10-12 19:35:03', 'modified_time': '2020-10-13 08:29:12', 'tag': 'Violence against women', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/202/dawn-com'}, 'keywords': 'Violence against women', 'news_keywords': 'Violence against women', 'author': 'Dawn.com'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1519932,12/2/19 7:06,View from the courtroom: KP lags behind in legislation to curb gender-based violence,"Like other countries the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is in focus in Pakistan. This international campaign starts from Nov 25, which is observed as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and ends on Dec 10, the International Human Rights Day.

During this campaign, the federal and provincial governments for the last many years continued to make commitments for taking steps to eradicate violence against women in the society. Successive governments mostly focused on legislation for addressing different aspects related to the gender-based violence.

In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the government has been dragging its feet on enactment of some important proposed laws for the last many years. Despite making commitments so far the provincial government fails to enact laws related to domestic violence, child marriages and acid and burn crimes control.

While rest of the three provinces have already enacted laws on domestic violence, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa no such law could be enacted though deliberations have been held for around a decade over the KP Domestic Violence against Women (Prevention and Protection) Bill. Similarly, during last many years the provincial government has been planning to replace the colonial-era Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929 with a provincial law, but the plan could not be materialised so far.

Moreover, there is no exclusive and comprehensive law to deal with offences related to acid and burn crimes. Over five years have passed since deliberations started on a draft bill, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Comprehensive Acid and Burn Crime Bill, by different stakeholders, including KP Commission on Status of Women, civil society members and government departments, but the law could not be enacted so far.

From time to time the federal and provincial governments have been introducing laws related to gender-based violence.

In early 2005, then government enacted the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act (Act No 1 of 2005) to check the inhuman customary practices of honour killing, swara and vani. Through that law, various amendments were made in the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The said amendments for the first time provided definition of honour-related crimes in the PPC, which states: “Offence committed in the name or on the pretext of honour means an offence committed in the name or on the pretext of karo kari, siyah kari or similar other customs or practices.”

The inhuman practice of giving females to rival groups in marriages for settling blood feuds was also declared a penal offence punishable with up to 10 years rigorous imprisonment.

Later, the Protection of Women (Criminal Laws Amendment) Act, 2006, was enacted on Nov 30, 2006. Through that law, changes were made in the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979, and adultery and fornication were turned into non-cognisable offences. Now, under the law a complaint has to be filed before the concerned court which has to decide to initiate proceedings in the case if sufficient evidence is available.

Two other laws were passed in 2010 to check harassment of women in public and at workplace. The first law, Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2010, was passed by the Parliament and given assent by the President on Jan 30, 2010. The amendments made harassment at workplace a penal offence punishable with up to three years imprisonment or with fine of up to Rs500,000.

Later the same year, the first exclusive law on the issue was enacted. The Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, received the assent of the President of Pakistan on March 9, 2010. The law provides for appointment of ombudsperson on both federal and provincial levels.

It is now binding that each organisation shall constitute an inquiry committee within 30 days of the enactment of the law to enquire into complaints of harassment. The schedule of the Act provides a “Code of Conduct for protection against harassment of women at workplace,” which includes guidelines for behaviour of all employees to ensure a work environment free of harassment and intimidation.

A few months ago, women rights activist Rukhshanda Naz was appointed as the first provincial anti-harassment ombudsperson in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Recently, she stated that she had issued letters to around 1,100 public and private sector organisations in the province, asking them to notify the inquiry committees and display the code of conduct in their offices.

At a recent programme, she stated that from Jan 2020 she would start taking action against the organisations which had not constituted the committees under the law.

Moreover, to prevent certain anti-women practices another law, Criminal Law (Third Amendment) Act, 2011, was introduced in Dec 2011. This law introduced certain amendments in the PPC and CrPC, providing for punishment for depriving women of their share of hereditary property, etc. The law is also aimed at checking the practices of swara and vani.

The government three years ago passed Criminal Law (Amendment) (Offences in the name or pretext of Honour) Act 2016, through which more amendments were made in PPC and CrPC to prevent honour-related offences.

A major development in year 2000 was the setting up of the National Commission on the Status of Women under the NCSW Ordinance 2000. Subsequently, the said ordinance was replaced with the NCSW Act 2012 in which a more elaborate mechanism has now been provided for appointment of the chairperson and members of the commission.

Similarly, in KP the provincial commission was set up in 2010, taking lead over other provinces. Later, in 2016 the KP Commission on the Status of Women Act was passed, which replaced the earlier law of 2010.

Interestingly, in connection with the 16 Days of Activism in 2017, then KP government, headed by chief minister Pervez Khattak, had announced formation of district committees on status of women in 23 of the districts. However, the said committees could not be notified so far. Legal experts believe that laws aimed at checking gender-based violence needed to be properly implemented so as to get desired results.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1447470,11/25/18 7:02,16 days of activism against gender-based violence begins,"ISLAMABAD: Violence against women and girls is one of the most widespread, persistent and devastating human rights violations in the world today and remains largely unreported due to the impunity, silence, stigma and shame surrounding it.

To raise voice against this violence, ‘International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women is being observed on Sunday.

This year’s theme is ‘16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence’ - to be culminated on Dec 10, the Human Rights Day - aimed at supporting women and girls around the world who are coming together in a movement of solidarity against the historic power imbalances in which sexual harassment and other forms of violence are so deeply rooted. The slogan is: “HearMeToo”.

The theme calls to honour these voices to listen to and believe survivors, to end the culture of silencing and impunity, and to put survivors at the centre of the conversation and response.

It aims to broaden the global conversation and highlight the voices and activism of all survivors of violence and advocates around the world - many of whom are often missing from the media headlines and social media discussions.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) says one in three women around the world experience physical or sexual violence, mostly by an intimate partner. This makes it the most widespread but among the least reported human rights abuses. It is prevalent during times of peace and stability, but risks escalate when a crisis strikes.

Furthermore, research indicates that the cost of violence against women could amount annually to around 2pc of global gross domestic product (GDP). This is equivalent to $1.5 trillion.

“Not until the half of our population represented by women and girls can live free from fear, violence and everyday insecurity, can we truly say we live in a fair and equal world,” says UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in his message.

WHO has published new clinical guidelines and tools to support countries and train healthcare providers to provide appropriate women-centred care.

In Pakistan, health worker trainings have been undertaken in three provinces.

Pakistan has several laws and policies against various forms of violence. But the challenges remain in implementing these measures, says a report of the UN Women on country profile 2018-22 for Pakistan.

Many women still lack access to free or affordable essential services in sectors such as health, police, justice and social support to ensure their safety, protection and recovery. Not enough is done to prevent violence, which is the most challenging but also effective way to eliminate violence in a sustainable way.

Pakistan is signatory to a number of internationally agreed norms and standards relating to ending violence against women and girls. Among the most prominent are: the 1979 Cedaw Convention, the 1993 Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women which became the first international instrument explicitly addressing violence against women, providing a framework for national and international action, the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action and the 2013 Commission on the Status of Women adopted agreed conclusions to eliminate and prevent all forms of violence against women and girls.

Local studies show that women’s movement and their use of public transport is compromised due to the discomfort, social stigma and fear of harassment when they are compelled to sit in close contact with unrelated men.

In making public transportation facilities accessible, ‘safe’ and ‘harassment-free’ for women and girls, an internationally recognised ‘safety audit tool’ was introduced for the first time and piloted in Lahore as part of a ‘safe cities’ initiative.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1587815,10/30/20 17:41,Sindh govt will approach courts to review underage Christian girl marriage case: Bilawal,"PPP chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Friday said the Sindh government will approach the relevant courts to seek a review in the case of Arzoo, a teenage Christian girl who was allegedly abducted from her Karachi residence before being forcefully converted and married off to a Muslim man.

Bilawal's statement comes a day after a sessions court in Karachi granted post-arrest bail to three suspects detained for allegedly abducting Arzoo, who is said to have converted to Islam.

""GOS (Government of Sindh) will approach the courts to review the #ArzooRaja underage marriage case, clear up any misunderstanding the honourable court may have, and do everything in their power to provide justice,"" the PPP chairman said in a tweet.

He added that the PPP-led provincial government had passed the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act in 2013 and it will ""continue to fight for it to be implemented"".

The alleged abduction of 13-year-old Arzoo had sparked protests from human rights groups against her purported forced conversion and underage marriage with a Muslim man.

Police claimed to have booked her purported husband Syed Ali Azhar and detained his two brothers — Syed Shariq Ali and Syed Mohsin Ali — along with his friend Danish over their alleged involvement in Arzoo's abduction on October 13. All the three detained men were said to be police officials.

On Thursday, the three detained suspects moved applications before additional district and sessions judge (South) Faiza Khalil seeking grant of post-arrest bail to them.

Their defence counsel Hidayat Ali Leghari contended that an application was filed with the judicial magistrate concerned for recording Arzoo's statement under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). However, the same could not be done.

He further said that later the girl purportedly recorded her statement before the Sindh High Court, in which she stated that she had embraced Islam out of her free choice and had solemnised a free-will marriage with Azhar Ali without any fear or pressure.

The counsel told the judge that in view of the reported statement of the teenage girl, the SHC had purportedly restrained police from arresting her husband Azhar Ali and his family members. Therefore, he asked the court to grant post-arrest bail to applicants Shariq Ali and Mohsin Ali, who are brothers of Azhar Ali, and Danish — all of whom are policemen.

After hearing arguments from the state prosecutor and the defence counsel, the judge granted post-arrest bail to Shariq Ali, Mohsin Ali and Danish, who is said to be posted at the Frere police station, against a surety of Rs50,000 each. The court directed the suspects to cooperate with police during the investigation of the case.

Arzoo's family members earlier this month told Dawn that her purported husband Azhar lived in a house opposite to their's along with his family and he is at least 45 years old. ""The rascal who abducted her has prepared fake papers to show that she is 18 years old,” her mother said.

According to the first information report of the case registered on his complaint, Arzoo's father Raja stated that on Oct 13, he and his wife went to work while their son Shahbaz had gone to school. The complainant said his three daughters, including Arzoo, were present at their home in Railway Colony when he received a call from a relative, who told him that Arzoo was missing from the house.

Raja said he reached home and contacted their neighbours, but could not trace his daughter. He subsequently lodged a case regarding the abduction of his daughter against unknown persons at the Frere police station.","['Dr. Salaria', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'M.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1394595/7-year-old-boy-found-dead-in-mardan,3/11/18 13:58,7-year-old boy found dead in Mardan,"The alleged kidnapping and murder of a seven-year-old boy in Mardan sparked protests on Sunday, with residents demanding the speedy arrest of the assailant.

District Police Officer Mian Saeed Ahmed said the boy was last seen playing in front of his house in the Tambulk area on Saturday before he went missing. A missing persons complaint was subsequently lodged with the police.

Early on Sunday morning, an unidentified suspect dumped a gunny sack holding the child's body in the fields behind the family's home and fled, the DPO said.

The boy was the son of a labourer who earns daily wages by loading and unloading vehicles at a nearby vegetable market, police said.

Police investigators cordoned off the crime scene and began collecting evidence.

The body was sent to Mardan Medical Complex for a post-mortem examination, hospital sources said, adding that DNA samples were collected from the body and sent to the Bacha Khan Medical College forensic laboratory for testing.

When the child's body was returned to his family, residents of the area blocked the Mardan-Nowshera Road with the body in protest, demanding the suspect's arrest.

The incident has caused a wave of fear, anger and grief to spread through locals. At least two similar cases have been reported in Mardan this year, in which minors who went missing and were recovered dead were believed to have been subjected to sexual assault.

As many as 17,862 cases of sexual assault against children have been reported throughout the country in the last five years, according to data presented to lawmakers in the National Assembly.","['Pervaiz Khan', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

At least two similar cases have been reported in Mardan this year, in which minors who went missing and were recovered dead were believed to have been subjected to sexual assault.","['medical', 'mardan', 'residents', 'sexual', 'sent', 'body', 'missing', 'went', 'boy', '7yearold', 'dead', 'reported']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/05/5742c05ec407c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2018/02/5a844f354e86c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/01/5887cc86ba3e4.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2017/01/5887cc86ba3e4.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2018/02/5a844f354e86c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2018/03/5aa4f06a793ed.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2018/01/5a5c9b3053503.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd329902b790.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2018/01/5a5c9b3053503.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/11/5a13f44f305f9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2017/11/5a13f44f305f9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2016/05/5742c05ec407c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/08/579ef729243aa.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2016/08/579ef729243aa.jpg?r=534440222', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2018/03/5aa4f06a793ed.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Body of boy recovered from gunny sack in fields near house; Protesting locals demand arrest of assailant.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1394595', 'type': 'article', 'title': '7-year-old boy found dead in Mardan', 'description': 'Body of boy recovered from gunny sack in fields near house; Protesting locals demand arrest of assailant.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2018/03/5aa4f06a793ed.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1394595', 'title': '7-year-old boy found dead in Mardan', 'description': 'Body of boy recovered from gunny sack in fields near house; Protesting locals demand arrest of assailant.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2018/03/5aa4f06a793ed.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2018-03-11 13:58:08', 'modified_time': '2018-03-11 14:00:44', 'tag': 'Violence against children', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/6770/pervaiz-khan'}, 'keywords': 'Violence against children', 'news_keywords': 'Violence against children', 'author': 'Pervaiz Khan'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1225253,12/22/15 12:45,A victim's account of the horrors of forced marriage,"It was a conversation I will never forget.

I knew Mariyam for a year before I learnt how she had once almost given up on life. A caring and loving person, I doubt I would have believed a word of her story if she weren’t sitting in front of me, telling it herself.

“It is happening again,” she said when I asked her why she seemed completely out of sorts that particular Thursday.

I asked her what she meant. “They’re going to marry me off to someone I don’t know, haven’t met, haven’t even seen.” It took a few seconds before I could mentally process what this girl, whose friendship I had begun to cherish in such a short span of time, was saying.

The obvious questions followed. Who will do this? What do you mean it’s happening again? And why would someone do this to you?

I could feel her carefully choosing her next words. Perhaps it had not been her intention to share this with me. It was possible that the stress of the situation made the words come out involuntarily. Either way she continued to share her story and I tried to remain calm as she shared one horrifying detail after another.

About six years ago, Mariyam’s father got her married to the son of a close friend’s business partner. She was about to turn 17 at the time.

“I think he believed he was doing what was best for me.” In reality, the marriage turned out to be anything but that for Mariyam.

Knowing she belonged to a very conservative household where all women were in strict purdah to the point that most family gatherings were also segregated, I didn’t feel the need to ask whether or not she was asked for her consent before the marriage was fixed. I knew she wasn’t. She was simply told.

Should we not then consider this a forced marriage? But let’s complete her story first.

She saw him for the first time after her nikkah, she had told me. And her first reaction to when she saw who she would be sharing her life with was a strong sense of discomfort, perhaps even fear.

Sadly for Mariyam, within six months of her marriage, her father unexpectedly passed away. At that time, Mariyam was three months pregnant.

Her husband had been verbally abusive before, but after her father’s passing, he grew physically violent. He only stopped beating her when his mother told him she might be carrying a boy.

She tried to share her ordeal with her mother but it’s difficult, if not impossible, for a widow in a patriarchal society, especially one belonging to a conservative household, to take a stand.

My mother would say that I should wait for the child to be born and his father will change and everything will be fine. “She said it so often, I started believing it,” Mariyam told me.

Change came, but for the worse.

Mariyam gave birth to a healthy baby boy. Her reward for that: her husband didn’t mercilessly beat her for a month. But after that grace period was over, she lived through some of the darkest moments of her life.

Everyone in the house knew, her father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, the servants, everyone. He wouldn’t hold back from beating her publicly over something like the drinking water not being the right temperature. But no one batted an eyelid.

She recalls seeing sympathy in her mother-in-law’s eyes just once when her husband flung her down the stairs six months after she had given birth to their son.

That fall landed Mariyam in the hospital with broken ribs and several fractures. Of course, everyone was told she slipped. Mariyam was too scared to dispute the story.

Somehow, her mother managed to convince her mother-in-law and took Mariyam home after spending about a week in the hospital.

Once home, Mariyam cried for days. Her husband now wouldn’t allow her to see her son. Eventually after two weeks, for the love of her son, she returned to her hell. And it was as fiery as she expected it to be.

Two months later, she decided she had had enough and began to think that suicide was her only salvation. But before she could do anything drastic, Mariyam found out that she was pregnant again.

I was almost certain he had raped her. I debated whether or not to ask this question, but she read my mind before I got the chance to speak. She had been, and it wasn’t the first time. Sometimes before and sometimes after he beat her, he would rape her to exert his power.

I felt my heart sinking — how can someone go through so much and still be standing.

Mariyam suffered an early miscarriage during her second pregnancy; the result of another torturous beating by her husband. After that, her brother, who was barely 15 at the time, came over one day when her husband wasn’t at the house, and took her home.

Demands for divorce were rejected by her husband who eventually agreed on the sole condition that Mariyam would give up all legal right to see her son again.

I can never forget how she looked at me and said: “It felt like someone ripped my heart right out of me.”

It had been four years since Mariyam had seen her little boy, but family pressure was building — she had a younger sister who was turning 16, and in order for her to get married, Mariyam’s divorcee status needed to change.

For the second time in her life, Mariyam was forced into marriage.

Now, over a decade later, she has four children from her second husband who while doesn’t beat her, keeps reminding her of her past and breaks whatever is left of her confidence and self-esteem.

Why don’t we understand what we are doing to our children especially our daughters in the name of traditions and customs? Child marriages and forced marriages remain dominant practices and not just in rural areas as many of us believe.

The cycle is vicious and unforgiving. Most children belonging to unhappy households do not grow up feeling the safety, security and confidence that should be their basic right. Watching their fathers beat their mothers has a lasting negative impact on sons as well.

Of course, I am not trying to generalise here. But as a country and as a nation, we must take steps and set standards so that no Mariyam ever has to suffer like this.","['Mahnoor Sherazee', 'Faizan Qureshi', 'Abdulla Hussain', 'M.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1514668,11/3/19 20:58,FO summons Afghan chargé d'affaires over 'harrassment of Pakistani diplomats' in Kabul,"The Foreign Office on Sunday summoned the Afghan chargé d'affaires in Islamabad to protest the ""harassment"" over the past two days of the staff of the Pakistan Embassy in Kabul and its sub-missions.

According to a statement issued by the FO spokesperson, Dr Mohammad Faisal, ""serious concerns"" were conveyed over the safety and security of the diplomatic personnel working at the embassy.

""The Afghan Cd’A was informed that the officers and staff of the Embassy of Pakistan were being harassed over the past two days. They were obstructed on the road and the Embassy vehicles were also hit by motorcycles while going towards the Embassy,"" said the statement.

The Cd'A was reminded of the Afghanistan government's responsibility, as a party to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities 1961, of ensuring ""safety, security and freedom of movement to all members of the Mission.""

The Cd’A was reminded that being party to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities 1961, it is the responsibility of the Government of Afghanistan to ensure safety, security and freedom of movement to all members of the Mission"".

He was asked to relay Pakistan's concerns with Afghan authorities and to urge them ""to immediately investigate these security violations and harassment incidents"".

It was also requested that a report in this regard be shared with Pakistan and that measures are taken to guard against the recurrence of such incidents in the future.

Later in the day, a notification was issued by the Embassy stating its decision to halt operations.

""Due to security reasons, Consular Section of the Embassy of Pakistan, Kabul will be closed from tomorrow, Monday, November 4, until further intimation,"" said the press release.

The incident comes a few weeks after Afghanistan closed its consulate in Peshawar for an indefinite period to protest the removal of its national flag from a disputed area known as Afghan Market.

The FO, in its response had regretted Afghanistan's decision and asked the government to review it. It had also rejec­ted the allegations raised by the Afghan government related to the disputed property.

It explained that the issue about the market was between a private citizen and a purported bank from Afghanistan. It pointed out that a court had decided the matter in favour of the private citizen in 1998.

“The recent enforcement action by the local administration occurred after legal remedies were exhausted by the Afghan party to this legal dispute. We reject any comments casting aspersions on the judicial process in Pakistan,” the FO had said.","['Naveed Siddiqui', 'Jamil Soomro', 'New York City', 'Peace Loving', 'M. Saeed', 'Gordon D.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1539208,3/8/20 7:05,Violence against women,"VIOLENCE against women in Pakistan is both a crime and a socially accepted norm. While we have laws that protect women from violence, the state has absolved itself of the responsibility to enforce these laws. This means that women have an inherently paradoxical relationship with the state: with one hand the state gives women rights in the form of constitutional guarantees, international treaty commitments and some progressive legislation; with the other it takes away these rights by refusing to implement these laws or take measures to create the conditions under which these rights can be realised.

Read: Violence against women persists despite legislation

The guarantee of formal equality and the obstinate refusal to grant substantive equality mirrors the behaviour of an abusive spouse who somehow convinces you that you need him even as he abuses you. When he suspects that you are about to leave him, he promises to change — and may even behave well for a few days, before going back to his old ways. Similarly, in response to daily reports of brutality against women and abysmal gender equality indicators, our state authorities will take certain measures periodically. There is widespread rhetoric about the integral role of women in the development of a nation; laws seeking to protect women are enacted; entire departments within the government are set up exclusively devoted to the development of women. When it comes to effectively protecting women against violence rooted in patriarchy, however, these same state authorities become either apathetic or complicit.

This is not to say that formal equality is insignificant. It is crucial in a context where social and cultural norms relegate women to subservient roles and render them highly vulnerable. It is valuable particularly in view of the fact that there was a time in Pakistan’s history when discrimination against women was official state policy. During Gen Ziaul Haq’s era, the state pursued an active agenda to preserve the subservient status of women. This period saw the enforcement of discriminatory policies and the imprisonment of women under Hudood laws.

Zia’s overt discrimination against women depended on conflating the suppression of women with tenets of Islam, and the portrayal of demands of gender equality as anti-religious. This insidious discourse continues to impede the movement for gender equality long after Zia is gone, and even after some of the pernicious laws passed under his time have been substantially chipped away. The association of equal citizenship of women with an ‘anti-Islam’ agenda continues to haunt the women’s movement. The fact that today the slogan ‘mera jism, meri marzi’ is deemed an insult to the religious and cultural values of the country is, in part, a result of Zia’s legacy.

The execution of these laws and policies belies the complete lack of interest of the state.

Thanks in large part to the women’s movement galvanised during Zia’s era, as well as a powerful global movement for women’s rights, subsequent governments have not pursued an overtly misogynistic state policy. Instead, the last few decades have seen a slew of policies and programmes aimed to prevent violence against women.

In 1995, Pakistan became a party to the Beijing Platform for Action, thereby committing to a range of policy measures to end all forms of discrimination against women. Some years later, the National Commission on the Status of Women was set up to monitor the state’s response to the progress of women. To respond to violence against women, the government proposed the establishment of women police stations. A number of initiatives to provide shelter and safe accommodation for women were rolled out — crisis centres, safe houses and working women hostels. Recent years have also seen the enactment of progressive laws to protect and punish violence against women, including laws prohibiting domestic violence and sexual harassment in the workplace.

The execution of these laws and policies, however, belies the complete lack of interest of the state to respond to violence against women. Neither budget nor personnel are allocated to enforce laws intended to protect women. There is impunity for law-enforcement authorities refusing to prevent and punish crimes against women. Institutions designed to address gender inequality, such as women development departments and women police stations, remain woefully de-prioritised.

The persistent gap between laws on paper and their practical implementation can be attributed to dysfunctional government. It should also be attributed to the resistance of the state to pose any real challenge to patriarchy. Violence against women is one of the most powerful tools of patriarchy and therefore effectively curbing violence will mean a big blow to one of the most important power structures of our society.

This begs the question: do policies and programmes exist to allow the state to portray an image of being ‘woman friendly’ while avoiding responsibility for taking truly effective measures? Are these measures really just smoke and mirrors, intended to deflect attention away from the unwillingness of the state to challenge patriarchy by taking effective measures to end violence against women?

Those struggling for the rights of women, however, are put in a difficult position as they cannot risk rejecting the superficial measures taken by the state or pretending that they do not exist. Even knowing that the state has no intention to implement laws and policies aimed to protect women, we must hold it to its promises no matter how insincere they may be. Effectively, the burden is again on women to motivate the state to enforce its laws, allocate funds toward protection mechanisms for women and ensure accountability for law enforcement and judicial officers who are derelict in their duties towards preventing and punishing violence against women.

Without a doubt, this is truly exhausting. Aurat March is an extremely powerful expression of the outrage at the apathy of the government towards pervasive discrimination. It is just as true now as it ever was that the state will not give women anything without a fight.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1039835,9/1/13 11:04,Outrage in India over first Delhi gang-rape sentence,"NEW DELHI: Indian newspapers and politicians called for harsher punishments for juveniles Sunday after the first verdict in the New Delhi gang-rape case saw a teenager sentenced to three years' detention.

The rape and murder of a 23-year-old student by six people, including a 17-year-old on a moving bus last December sparked nationwide protests and led to calls for longer sentences in sexual assault cases.

“TRAVESTY: December 16 teen rapist 'gets away' with murder,” a headline in the tabloid Mail Today read, summing up the mood.

The convicted teen will now spend about 28 months in a juvenile detention centre, having already spent about eight months in custody while awaiting a verdict.

“He can watch TV, play games while doing time,” the Hindustan Times reported, while pointing out that police sources had earlier described the teenager as “the most brutal” among the six attackers.

The Times of India said the gang-rape victim had “been denied justice” by the juvenile court.

“Almost everybody will agree that there is something wrong with a system that allows someone who has raped and brutalised a girl, resulting in her death, to walk free after just three years because he was a 'juvenile',” it said in a front-page editorial.

It is time for India to change the law and measure “the age below which a person is considered juvenile to the nature of the crime”, it said.

Sushma Swaraj, leader of the opposition in the lower house of parliament, said on Twitter that she was set to introduce a bill on Friday, calling for amendments to juvenile laws.

“This meagre punishment of just three years does not do justice,” Swaraj tweeted.

“The sentence must commensurate with the gravity of the offence irrespective of the age of the offender,” she added.

The rape victim's family said they would continue to fight for a tougher punishment.

A petition in the Supreme Court has been filed by politician Subramanian Swamy challenging the law and requesting that the gravity of the crime be taken into account during sentencing.

The victim, a physiotherapy student, died of internal injuries two weeks after being raped and assaulted with an iron bar on the night of December 16.

Her male companion was also beaten up before both were thrown bleeding from the bus.

A separate trial of the four adult suspects in a fast-track court is hearing closing arguments and is expected to wrap up in the next few weeks, with the men facing a possible death sentence if convicted.

The fifth adult, the suspected ring leader, died in jail in an apparent suicide.","['Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1137148,10/11/14 6:14,Sindh records 421 cases of violence against women in three months,"KARACHI: Khairpur — the home district of Sindh Chief Minister Syed Qaim Ali Shah — tops the list of districts in the province with the highest number of violence incidents against women recorded during the third quarter of the year, says a report released on Friday.

In all 421 incidents of violence against women and girls were reported and 72 of them were recorded in Khairpur alone, according to the quarterly report titled “Situation of Violence Against Women in Sindh (July-September 2014)”.

Prepared by the Aurat Foundation, a non-governmental organisation working on women-related issues, the report says the 421 incidents involved 534 women and girls but FIRs were registered only in 66 cases.

The report, based on figures published in newspapers over a period of three months, says that the issue of violence against women was rooted in social norms and economic dependence while the discriminatory practices were the result of the patriarchal system.

Gender-based violence helped maintain women in subordinate roles and contributed to their low level of political participation and to their lower level of education, skills and work opportunities, it adds. A badly-worded FIR also harms prosecution cases obstructing women’s access to effective remedies, the report says.

Most of the time police are not informed about such incidents, while some of those reported to the police are not recorded in roznamcha (police diary), the report says. Even if a few cases are lodged, inquiries are not properly conducted and the matter is eventually shelved, it adds.

It was observed that urban areas were fast catching up with the rural areas as far as far as violence against women was concerned, as out of the 421 cases, 197 were reported in the urban areas. About the marital status of victims, the report mentions that out of the 534 women victims, 249 (59 per cent) were married while 67 were unmarried whereas the marital status of 218 victims remained unknown owing to incomplete information.

The nature of crimes in the violence against women included murder (76 women), hunour killing (57), suicide (49), jirga (41), abducted and kidnapped (41), injury (39), rape / gang rape (21/5), sexual assault (17), torture (17) and attempted suicide (19).

Ninety-one of the victims aged between 19 and 36 years, 66 were minors and 13 were over 37 years, while the age of 364 other victims of violence could not be ascertained, the report adds.

The district-wise number of cases during the three months were Khairpur (72), Jacobabad (46), Larkana (45), Shikarpur (28), Sanghar (27), Sukkur (23), Benazirabad (21), Ghotki (21), Naushahro Feroz (16), Mirpurkhas (15), Kashmore (15), Tharparkar (14), Karachi (12), Jamshoro (12), Dadu (11), Hyderabad (9), Badin (8), Qamber-Shahdadkot (8), Thatta (7), Matiari (4), Umerkot (4), Tando Mohammad Khan (2) and Tando Allahyar (1).

In the report, Aurat Foundation chief Mahnaz Rehman demanded that the government ensure that laws against domestic violence, rape, sexual harassment and other gender-based violence gave adequate protection to all women, and respected their integrity and dignity and appropriate protective and support services were provided to the victims.

Gender-sensitive training for judicial and law-enforcement officers and other public officials was essential for the effective implementation of the laws and international conventions signed by the country, she said, adding that inadequate policing and judicial practices denied proper protection and justice to female victims.

The report stated female participation in public life was increasing with new laws being enacted but there was still a long way for women to get the status of equal citizens in society.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1511461,10/18/19 7:10,"Stakeholders discuss steps to end child, forced marriages","KARACHI: A provincial dialogue was held to deliberate on how best to achieve Pakistan’s commitment under SDG 5.3 on ending child and forced marriages at a hotel here on Thursday.

The event was organised by the Sindh Commission on the Status of Women (SCSW) and Shirkat Gah Women’s Resource Centre (SG).

Nuzhat Shirin, chairperson SCSW, while presenting her keynote address said that “In the homes of the poor one sees 12 to 15 children due to the early marriage of the mother but she is not a baby bearing machine.

“Our budget allocations don’t include money for awareness programmes. Here area police stations don’t even know how to handle an early marriage case. The police see [it] as a personal family matter, which it is not. Many people here don’t even know that early marriages are a violation of the law and how they affect the health of girls. The laws passed need to be revisited to check for gaps that come in the way of implementation,” she said.

“We say that women and girls are our honour and respect but at least give them their rights,” she added.

‘Many people here don’t even know that early marriages are a violation of the law’

Engaging multiple stakeholders, including government officials and policymakers, subject experts and civil society members, the dialogue was also an opportunity to discuss how to achieve Pakistan’s commitments based on key lessons from Shirkat Gah’s Humsathi project.

‘Mothers are strongest supporters of girls’

Madiha Shekhani, programme officer with Shirkat Gah, introduced the Humsathi project and some of its key findings. “The project is not just about spreading awareness among girls. It reaches out to parents, elders such as aunts and uncles of girls and society in general. It has also helped give confidence to girls so that they have started talking despite all resistance from society. There is now a better communication between mothers and daughters too as the barriers there have been taken down. Mothers have emerged as strongest supporters for girls,” she said.

“People too have started quoting laws to stop early marriages. There was a recent example of a wife threatening her husband of consequences if he went ahead with his plans of getting his underage daughter married. She said she will complain against him to the police. It worked even though the police still need to be sensitised to the issue,” she said.

Shahnoor, one of the team leaders going about spreading awareness, who with her team had only just returned from doing work in Shahdadkot, shared some of her team’s experiences. “We faced several challenges such as gathering girls and drawing out male supporters for the cause, talking to police personnel and nikah registrars but we didn’t give up. We were looking to change mindsets and even after coming back our work in that direction has not stopped,” she said.

A panel discussion moderated by activist, researcher and teacher Sarah Zaman highlighted the impact of child and early age marriages while pondering over solutions to prevent the practice.

‘Implementation is weak’

Senior country adviser on population programme of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, Yasmeen Qazi, said that implementation of bills and laws was weak and accountability was a weak link. “Are the parliamentarians monitoring implementation of laws in their constituencies?” she said.

The executive director of Ahung, Sheena Hadi, drew attention to the issue of physical development of girls forced into early marriage. “There are going to be a number of childbirth issues too. The girls are also undernourished and being made to carry out general housework is like physical violence,” she said.

Lawyer Maliha Zia Lari said that the rules of business for a law explain the process which makes them very important. “There is a lack of knowledge of stakeholders or institutions,” she said. “Also it is difficult to identify the age of a girl when reporting a case because her relatives and others involved in getting her married insist that she is 18. This can be remedied by registering births. The B-form should be made an essential document.”

Uzma Noorani, of the Panah Shelter Home, said that they kept girls who had married early till they were of legal age. “After reaching legal age, they can decide if they want to live with their husbands or if they want to leave them. The courts sent us 15 girls last year and this year we got six. In the case of forced conversions, the girls are usually underage. But shelter homes need directions about whether we should let the girls meet their parents. Usually they don’t want to see their parents as they can’t face them but they meet their husbands. It is a dilemma for us about whom the girls should be allowed to meet. There should be juvenile centres for such cases as in shelter homes the girls are exposed to an adult environment and most of the females there are far older than them,” she said.

Dr Kausar Saeed Khan, member, National Commission on the Status of Women, spoke about healthcare in child marriages.

Ravi Dawani, secretary general of the All Pakistan Hindu Panchayat, urged the government to set up National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) offices all over the province. “Places such as Tharparkar must have Nadra offices. Parents must register births and get B-forms so that girls’ ages can be verified,” he said. “Then Hindu Panchayat should also share its data regarding each individual with the authorities as they do keep their records.”

Adiba Hasan, a parliamentarian, meanwhile, said that her five bills regarding women were still doing the rounds of departments. “They have still not been passed while girls are forced by their fathers, who also force their mothers, to marry early. Basically, all these issues are happening due to lack of education, and the men need education more than the women,” she said.

Summing up, Dr Aysha Khan, a researcher, said that the Humsathi project’s findings showed that change was possible. “But it is important to put in place the building blocks for social change, so to say. The drivers of child marriage are complicated and the solutions are as complicated and multifaceted. But we have to keep the conversation going,” she said.

Senior programme officer Shirkat Gah Afshan Naz and politician and advocate Mehfooz Yar Khan also spoke.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1271913,7/20/16 7:08,Qandeel murder case: family has edge over state,"LAHORE: Legal experts see government’s move of becoming a complainant in the murder case of social media celebrity Qandeel Baloch as an attempt to end apprehensions that legal heirs may pardon the killer-brother at a later stage of trial.

Police added section 311 (Ta’zir after waiver or compounding of right of qisas in qatl-i-amd) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) in the first information report besides Section 302 (qatl-i-amd or intentional murder). It is believed that the decision to include Section 11 in the FIR was taken to make the case a non-compoundable (non-reconcilable).

Waseem Azeem has already confessed to kill his sister (Qandeel) in the name of ‘honour’.

Criminal law experts believe that the government’s move would not affect the right of wali or complainant to pardon the killer. In this case, the father of Qandeel Baloch is the main complainant. They say the state, under the law, always acts as a necessary party in every criminal case to prosecute the offenders.

Advocate Asad Jamal has an opinion that state can be legal heir (wali) only if there is no one from the family of the victim. In the case of Qandeel, her parents are alive, he says, adding that they can forgive their son (killer).

He says legally once the suspect confesses to the commission of the offence and the court admits such evidence under section 304 (Proof of qatl-i-amd liable to qisas) of the PPC, qisas becomes applicable.

Consequently, waiver (forgiveness without consideration/diyat etc) or reconciliation (compromise as a result of payment of diyat, for instance) of the offence becomes a real possibility unless the court goes to the extent of declaring the criminal act as fasad-fil-arz in which case the court can hand down a minimum punishment of 10 years of imprisonment as ta’azir, advocate Jamal states.

He adds that the court can also hand down death or imprisonment for life in honour killing cases as ta’azir.

Advocate Azam Nazir Tarar says under the existing scheme of law it is the state’s primary duty to prosecute criminals. He says private individuals are permitted to prosecute but not exclusively.

Mr Tarar says the role of the state as complainant in a case will not prejudice the wali’s right to pardon. However, he states, wali’s right to forgive a killer is not unfettered and subject to approval of the court.

Advocate Aftab Bajwa also sees government’s move as useless, saying the trial court has the jurisdiction to decide whether a criminal act falls within the definition of fasad-fil-arz under the section 311 of the PPC. He has the opinion that it is a simple murder case carrying punishment under section 302 of the PPC.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1583103,10/4/20 8:12,Child abuser awarded 14 years jail term,"PESHAWAR: A child protection court in Mardan on Saturday convicted a man of sexual abuse of a minor girl and awarded 14 years rigorous imprisonment and Rs1 million fine to him.

Judge Ijaz Ahmad pronounced that Jan Mohammad was found to be guilty of subjecting the five-year-old to sexual abuse and therefore, he had been sentenced under Section 53 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010, and Section 377-A of the Pakistan Penal Code.

The court also declared that the prosecution had proved the charge of attempted rape against the accused, so he had been sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs100,000 under sections 376 and 511 of the PPC.

The FIR of the child abuse was registered by the Choora police station in Mardan on Jan 27, 2019, under Section 53 of the CPWA and sections 376 and 511 of the PPC.

Mardan court also convicted him of rape attempt

Complainant in the case was the girl’s father, who said his minor daughter went out of house to play with neighbours and when he stepped out to offer a prayer, he learned from the children that his daughter was taken away by a man, who had given her a Rs10 currency note.

He said he and his brother caught a man in a nearby sugarcane field after the girl was sexually assaulted by him.

The defense counsel claimed that the report of the medical examination of the alleged assault victim turned out to be negative with no marks of violence on her body.

He said the exercise to match the semen from the trousers of the accused and those of the girl wasn’t carried out to prove the commission of the offence by his client.

Overruling the arguments of the defence counsel, the court referred to the definition of ‘sexual abuse’ given in the CPWA and observed that no marks of violence or wound could only constitute the offence of sexual abuse.

It ruled that non-examination of the accused for the purpose of ascertaining his capability to commit sexual assault was also not necessary for the prosecution to establish the act of sexual abuse or attempt towards the commission of the offence of rape.

The court ruled that all witnesses were consistent in their deposition and no material contradiction had been found in their depositions.

It added that one of the witnesses was not related to the complainant and therefore, he was an independent and an impartial witness.

It added that one of the witnesses was not related to the complainant and therefore, he was an independent and an impartial witness.","['witnesses', 'child', 'abuser', 'awarded', 'offence', '14', 'sexual', 'man', 'girl', 'jail', 'violence', 'abuse', 'accused', 'court', 'term']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189f00b83e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0d52ba8a43.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1c8148f86a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d005917e0.jpg?0.8785461548197806', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1b64d7eb7a.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd192bbacb28.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d719e1f62.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1793dc4884.jpg?r=1459847184', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd179607e531.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189916390d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0ec56aad75.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1b89650695.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1b9ccb6c70.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18a3ece187.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fc7833a64a3a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd17990224f6.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1b7a7c513c.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d6ce529d0.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1b927be885.png', 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}",TRUE,http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Mardan court also convicted him of rape attempt', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1583103', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Child abuser awarded 14 years jail term', 'description': 'Mardan court also convicted him of rape attempt', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1583103', 'title': 'Child abuser awarded 14 years jail term', 'description': 'Mardan court also convicted him of rape attempt', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-10-04 08:12:50', 'modified_time': '2020-10-04 08:12:50', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/183/bureau-report'}, 'author': 'Bureau Report'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1272016,7/20/16 18:14,"PML-N to pass law against honour killings following Qandeel's murder, says Maryam","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz plans to pass long-delayed legislation against “honour killings” within weeks in the wake of the high-profile murder of outspoken social media star Qandeel Baloch, the daughter of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said on Wednesday.

The bill will go before a parliamentary committee as early as Thursday, said Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who is an increasingly influential member of her father's ruling party.

The government has faced mounting pressure to pass the law against murders carried out by people professing to be acting in defence of the honour of their family.

The law would remove a loophole that allows other family members to pardon a killer.

The brother of social media star Qandeel Baloch has been arrested in connection with her strangling death and told a news conference he was incensed by her often risque posts on social media.

Some 500 women are killed each year in Pakistan at the hands of family members over perceived damage to “honour” that can involve eloping, fraternising with men or any other infraction against conservative values that govern women's modesty.

Maryam Nawaz said the government wanted to pass the law unanimously and had been negotiating with religious parties in parliament.

“We have finalised the draft law in the light of negotiations,” she told Reuters in an interview.

“The final draft will be presented to a committee of joint session of parliament on July 21 for consideration and approval.”

Maryam said once the parliamentary committee approved the bill, it would be presented for a vote in a “couple of weeks” before a joint session of parliament.

A spokesman for Jamaat-i-Islami, one of the two major religious parties in parliament, said his party would not oppose the bill.

The country’s other main religious political party, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, could not be reached for comment but it has only a small number of seats in parliament.

Both religious parties have traditionally opposed legislation empowering women.

The upper house of parliament passed the bill in 2015 but it lapsed after the government failed to put it up for a vote in the lower house because it was preoccupied with legislation aimed at tackling security problems and economic reforms.

A senior government official told Reuters all major parties were now backing the bill and it was likely to be passed in a few weeks by a joint session of parliament.

“The prime minister is taking personal interest,” added a second official and close aide to Sharif.

“You will see in coming days more will be done, big changes will be announced.”

In a rare move, this week the government became a complainant in the police case against Qandeel's brother accused of her murder, designating it a crime against the state and thereby blocking her family from forgiving their son.

Right to forgive

Qandeel had long divided opinion with her social media photos and posts.

She was unapologetic about pushing the boundaries of acceptability for women and changing “the typical orthodox mindset” of her audience.

Many viewed her as a disgrace to cultural values while others hailed her as a “feminist icon”.

She ran into political controversy last month after her “selfie” photographs with Mufti Qavi went viral, leading to him being fired from the Ruet-i-Hilal committee.

After her death, Mutfi Qavi told media that her murder should serve as an example for others who tried to malign the clergy.

Qavi is being investigated for her murder along with Qandeel's two brothers.

Although government officials appeared confident of backing for the bill in parliament, it could still face resistance.

The influential Council of Islamic Ideology, which advises the government on the compatibility of laws with Islam, warned that it would not support any law that removed the forgiveness loophole, even though the council considers honour killings a crime.

“Islamic law and the Quran say that the right to forgive or punish lies first and foremost with the victim's family,” said council spokesman Inam Ullah.

“So if this bill is trying to completely take away that right from the family, then of course that is against Islamic teachings. The state cannot completely take away that right from the family.”

The religious parties and the council hold significant influence over public opinion and the government fears a backlash if any law passes without their approval.

“This mentality — that you can get away with murder in the name of honour — it has to be done away with,” said Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, whose documentary on honour killings “A Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness” won an Oscar this year.

“I am hopeful that this law will pass but the change in mindset will talk so much longer... I think Qandeel Baloch's murder is the tipping point.”","['Sane Mind', 'Nasir Shah', 'Taimoor Khan', 'The Truth', 'Unshackle Pakistan', 'I. Ahmed', 'Col.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1472645,3/29/19 21:12,Woman shot dead by brother over 'love marriage' in Karachi: police,"A woman who had contracted a free-will marriage last year was shot dead allegedly by her brother in Karachi's Saeedabad neighbourhood on Friday, police said. Her brother-in-law was killed as well.

The 30-year-old woman was travelling in a rickshaw with her 22-year-old brother-in-law when unidentified pillion riders opened fire on them at Pakistan Chowk in Dawood Goth.

The duo sustained critical bullet injuries and were transported to Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi where doctors pronounced them dead on arrival, according to police surgeon Dr Qarar Ahmed.

Editorial: Murder, not ‘honour’

Both the suspects managed to escape the crime scene.

Station House Officer Irfan Asif told Dawn that the deceased woman had married a man of her own free will in 2018. It was their love marriage and the woman's family did not approve of it.

The officer claimed that the woman's brother along with another suspect carried out the double murder.

The slain woman belonged to the Rind tribe while her husband hails from the Brohi tribe.

According to police, investigators collected four spent bullet casings fired from 9mm and 30-bore pistols from the crime scene.

Meanwhile, Sindh Inspector General of Police Dr Syed Kaleem Imam took notice of the woman and her brother-in-law's murder and sought a detailed report from West SSP Shoukat Ali, a police spokesperson said.","['Imtiaz Ali', 'Gordon D.

According to a first information report (FIR) filed in the Kallar Syedan police station on the complaint of the victim's friend on Thursday night, Amjad was stopped by the police at a roundabout while he was driving in the city. The FIR said that Amjad had stopped his car when an ASI came near it with an SMG rifle and shot at the former councillor several times ""with the intent to murder"", according to complainant Habibur Rehman.

Amjad, who was grievously injured by the shooting, was taken to the THQ hospital by the complainant, from where he was sent to DHQ hospital. Upon reaching the DHQ hospital, Amjad succumbed to his injuries.

The FIR nominated ASIs Imran Khalid and Taqdees Akhtar, and constables Habib Akhtar, Azhar Mehmood and Atif Shehzad for Amjad's killing.

CPO Rana said that following the registration of the FIR, ASI Khalid and Constable Habib were arrested by police. All five of the officials have been suspended, he added.

Earlier, Habib had filed a complaint against Amjad in the same police station. According to Habib, Amjad had failed to stop when the police signalled him to and instead hit the constable with his car, after which Taqdees shot at the former councillor.

According to Habib, Amjad had failed to stop when the police signalled him to and instead hit the constable with his car, after which Taqdees shot at the former councillor.","['rawalpindi', 'killing', 'habib', 'waheed', 'fir', 'taqdees', 'anjum', 'asi', 'syedan', 'amjad', 'station', 'councillor', 'hospital', 'constables', 'stopped', 'asis', 'allegedly', 'suspended']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd329902b790.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/11/5de0df3212fb7.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/11/5de096d7a87dc.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/11/5de096d7a87dc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/11/5dd7a215c78de.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2019/11/5de0df3212fb7.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/11/5dd7a215c78de.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/01/5c453e39c2aa1.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/01/5c453e39c2aa1.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2019/11/5de0df3212fb7.png,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Amjad\'s friend says an ASI shot the former councillor ""with the intent to murder"".', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1519530', 'type': 'article', 'title': '2 ASIs, 3 constables suspended for allegedly killing former councillor Waheed Anjum in Rawalpindi', 'description': 'Amjad\'s friend says an ASI shot the former councillor ""with the intent to murder"".', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2019/11/5de0df3212fb7.png'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1519530', 'title': '2 ASIs, 3 constables suspended for allegedly killing former councillor Waheed Anjum in Rawalpindi', 'description': 'Amjad\'s friend says an ASI shot the former councillor ""with the intent to murder"".', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2019/11/5de0df3212fb7.png'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2019-11-29 14:07:48', 'modified_time': '2019-11-29 21:10:27', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/6064/tahir-naseer'}, 'author': 'Tahir Naseer'})",[],dawn

Mobin was reportedly at the site to negotiate with protesters for an end to the sit-in and to clear the area.

A large group of chemists and pharmaceutical manufacturers were gathered in front of the provincial assembly to protest a government crackdown against the sale of illegal drugs. There was a significant presence of law enforcers in the area while the protest was ongoing.

Up to 400 people had attended the protest, according to an AFP reporter who was on the scene when the explosion occurred.

Rescue services, including ambulances and fire tenders, reached the scene soon after the attack. An emergency was also declared in all hospitals of Lahore. Majority of the casualties were shifted to Mayo Hospital and Ganga Ram Hospital.

Contingents of Pakistan Army and Rangers also reached the site.

The security forces cordoned off the area with tents, with the inner cordon taken over by Army personnel. Forensic teams were collecting evidence and had started initial investigations.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attack and reiterated Pakistan is in decisive fight against terrorism while praising the sacrifices of the slain security personnel.

Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa instructed local military commanders and intelligence agencies to provide all necessary assistance to civilian authorities and arrest those responsible, a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) read.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1535726,2/21/20 7:01,‘Honour’ in shame,"A RECENT report by the Sindh Police has put into perspective the extent to which our society — including the criminal justice system itself — continues to justify, condone and encourage violence against women under the guise of tradition and faith. According to the report, in the past five years, 510 women and 259 men have been murdered in cold blood on the pretext of ‘honour’ across the province. Out of the total number of cases, 649 reached the police. However, only 19 cases — a paltry 2pc — resulted in awarding of punishment to perpetrators. The courts acquitted the suspects in 136 other cases, while the remaining 494 cases still await trial. Though these figures might reflect only a fraction of the actual number of such murders, they are enough to expose our hypocrisy. We have laws but little to no implementation. Those who make these laws are often found advocating for or even participating in the very ‘traditions’ that violate women’s right to life and bodily autonomy. Members of the public want rule of law, yet many end up pardoning family members who murder female relatives. Worse still are those who twist a religion that considers murder as among the greatest of sins in order to justify killing women.

It is hardly surprising, then, that this dissonance reflects in the anti-‘honour’ killing law enacted in 2016. Though a major achievement in symbolic terms, as a legal instrument, it represents only an incremental step towards justice for those killed in the name of ‘honour’. The criminal amendment still permits family members of victims to ‘forgive’ their killers, while leaving it at the courts’ discretion to award punishment despite such pardons. Such a loophole — one among many — allows for the subjective interpretation and application of the law by police officers, prosecutors and judges alike. The report highlights these legal lacunae, along with faulty investigations, as well as collusion between prosecutors, witnesses and suspects, as being the main reasons behind the low conviction rate in ‘honour’ killings.

Besides, passing legislation is hardly enough to effect change in societal attitudes and break the vicious cycle of gender-based violence. Apart from improving the law and sensitising agents of the justice system, there is a dire need for comprehensive community outreach to combat the tacit acceptance of such ‘traditions’ in our society. In this regard, the media — particularly the Sindhi media — has played a commendable role, first by exposing and then continuing to shine a spotlight on such grotesque crimes. But the media’s job is only to inform, and change is only possible if the state proactively assumes its responsibility to vigorously prosecute and punish perpetrators as well as their abettors. Continued apathy in this regard only serves to endorse anti-women practices such ‘honour’ killings, which are in total violation of fundamental rights enshrined in our Constitution.

Initial investigation into the murder suggests that the family members of the couple gave them electric shocks until they died before secretly burying the bodies at a graveyard in Sherpao Colony, Ali Hasan Brohi goth, he said.

Earlier while talking to Dawn, Malir SSP Rao Anwar said that the police came to know about the dual murder through an informer and a case was filed on behalf of the state. Subsequently, police arrested the fathers as well as some other family members of both the victims.

The families were enraged over the marriage of the 15-year-old girl and the 17-year-old boy, who had run away from their houses last month, he added.

The accused confessed to their crime, according to the police, and revealed that a jirga was involved in declaring death sentence to both the victims.

Hundreds of women are murdered every year in Pakistan, often by their own relatives, for going against their families' wishes in matters of love and marriage.

The Aurat Foundation’s annual report of 2016 showed 7,852 cases of violence against women.

According to Saima Munir, who works for the Aurat Foundation, there has been a 70 per cent increase in honour killings in the past year.","['Imtiaz Ali', 'An Observer', 'Muhammad Tahir Jamali', 'Hadi Noor', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1288569,10/7/16 6:36,"Anti-honour killing, anti-rape bills finally passed","ISLAMABAD: The joint sitting of both houses of parliament on Thursday finally passed two key pro-women bills that have been pending assent for a long time.

The Anti-Honour Killing Laws (Criminal Amendment Bill) 2015 and the Anti-Rape Laws (Criminal Amendment Bill) 2015 were originally piloted by PPP legislator Sughra Imam and passed by the Senate in March 2015. However, since they were not taken up by the National Assembly in time, the bills lapsed.

Thereafter, the only way to secure their passage was in a joint sitting of parliament.

Although the bills remained in cold storage for quite some time, parliamentarians were jolted out of their lassitude when a number of horrific incidents of women-burning came to light in quick succession in June; Maria Sadaqat in Murree, Ambreen in Abbottabad and Nazia Hameed in Kasur. These were followed by the shocking honour-killing of social media personality Qandeel Baloch by her own brother.

New law calls for life sentence to ‘honour-killers’ even if victim’s family forgives them

This series of tragic events reinvigorated efforts for the passage of these bills, but efforts were stalled as the Committee of the Joint Sitting on Bills struggled to win over the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and Jamaat-i-Islami (JI). Both parties were not ready to vote for the proposed laws because they considered them to be against the tenets of Islam, though their primary objections were to the anti-honour killing bill.

Under the new law, if a woman is murdered in the name of honour by a close family member, they will be liable to strict punishment even if they are pardoned by another family member.

Law Minister Zahid Hamid told Dawn that the bills had been unanimously approved by the Committee of the Joint Sitting on Bills.

According to him, the anti-honour killing bill, in principle, directs judges to sentence someone accused of an honour-killing to a life-term in prison, whether the victim’s immediate family forgives the culprit or not.

On Thursday, however, PPP senators Farhatullah Babar, Sherry Rehman and others objected to the watering down of this clause, and asked for honour-killing to be declared a non-compoundable offence.

Mr Babar told the house that when murder was not compoundable under anti-terror laws, meaning that qisas and diyat did not apply, why was it being made an ideological issue for this law?

He termed those opposing the exclusion of qisas and diyat from the honour-killing law as being motivated by “politics and not religion”.

Anti-rape bill

The most significant provision of this bill is the fact that it gives legal cover to the collection and use of DNA evidence to prove that rape has been committed.

This flies in the face of a ruling by the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), which had held in 2013 that DNA evidence could not be considered as primary evidence in rape cases, though it could be used as supporting evidence.

“Parliament has asserted its authority over the CII through this law,” Mr Babar told Dawn after the session.

The DNA samples collected shall be at the earliest sent for investigation to a forensic laboratory whereat these shall be properly examined and preserved.

— Text of the bill

The bill makes amendments to Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) 1860, Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) 1898 and the Qanun-i-Shahadat Order 1984, some of which are quite ground-breaking.

For example, it holds officers who may sabotage or disregard the investigation to account by stipulating three years in prison, a fine, or both for those who do not pursue an inquiry diligently.

It also increases the punishment for obstruction of such an investigation from three months in prison to one year, and the fine from Rs500 to Rs50,000.

The new law stipulates that anyone who rapes a minor or a mentally or physically disabled person will be liable for the death penalty or life imprisonment.

The same punishment is prescribed if a public servant such as police officer, jailer or medical officer takes advantage of their position to commit rape.

It also declares that trials for offences such as rape and related crimes shall be conducted in-camera and also allows for the use of technology such as video links to record statements of the victim and witnesses, to spare them the humiliation or risk entailed by court appearances.

The media has also been barred from publishing or publicising names or any information that would reveal the identity of a victim, except when publishing court judgements.

Talking about the anti-rape bill, Mr Babar said that the new bill also deletes provisions in the Qanun-i-Shahadat (law of evidence) relating to questioning the character of the rape victim, so that sex workers are not excluded from the law’s protection.

Oscar-winning filmmaker Sharmeen-Obaid Chinoy, who was one of the voices calling for the swift adopting of these bills, told Dawn their passage was a win for the women of Pakistan.

“This bill is the first step - we need to make sure it is implemented and men are sent to jail for honour-killings. We need to make examples of people so that men begin to understand there is no honour in killing a woman,” she concluded.

He termed those opposing the exclusion of qisas and diyat from the honour-killing law as being motivated by “politics and not religion”.","['bills', 'sitting', 'honourkilling', 'antirape', 'antihonour', 'joint', 'passed', 'finally', 'laws', 'told', 'rape', 'bill', 'killing', 'law']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/07/578f783b94d28.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/07/5787699eb3436.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2016/07/578f783b94d28.jpg?r=1902704095', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/02/56ce9e3b7b1b6.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2016/10/57f74bed4affe.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/10/57f66e8e61b71.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd309b711467.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2016/02/56ce9e3b7b1b6.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3081f699b5.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2016/07/5787699eb3436.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd306ee076b9.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2016/10/57f74bed4affe.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'New law calls for life sentence to ‘honour-killers’ even if victim’s family forgives them.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'http://www.dawn.com/news/1288569', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Anti-honour killing, anti-rape bills finally passed', 'description': 'New law calls for life sentence to ‘honour-killers’ even if victim’s family forgives them.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2016/10/57f74bed4affe.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'http://www.dawn.com/news/1288569', 'creator': 'mightyobvious', 'title': 'Anti-honour killing, anti-rape bills finally passed', 'description': 'New law calls for life sentence to ‘honour-killers’ even if victim’s family forgives them.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2016/10/57f74bed4affe.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2016-10-07 06:36:50', 'modified_time': '2016-10-07 12:17:22', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/2819/hassan-belal-zaidi'}, 'author': 'Hassan Belal Zaidi'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1561065,6/3/20 17:11,189pc increase in cyber harassment complaints during lockdown: Digital Rights Foundation,"The Digital Rights Foundation has reported a 189 per cent increase in complaints registered with their Cyber Harassment Helpline during Pakistan's countrywide lockdown, enforced to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.

""As Pakistan entered its lockdown [in March] in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, we feared there would be an increase in cyber harassment cases as well as cyber attacks in general,"" a press release issued on Wednesday by the not-for-profit organisation said.

The organisation, which works to ensure ""digital freedoms"" in the country, reported a combined 136 complaints of cyber harassment in March and April — during the lockdown — compared to 47 such complaints, an increase of 189pc, before the lockdown in January and February.

Seventy four per cent of the complaints registered in March and April were reported by women, whereas, men and non-binary persons registered 19pc and 5pc complaints, respectively.

A majority of the cases that the organisation's cyber harassment helpline received during the lockdown months ""pertained to blackmailing through non-consensual sharing of information, intimate pictures and videos"".

Complaints of hate speech, phishing, fake profiles and defamation were also reported, according to the Digital Rights Foundation.

Women in Pakistan are victims of forms of gendered violence in the digital sphere that includes sexual harassment, surveillance, unauthorised use and dissemination of personal data, and manipulation of personal information, the organisation said.

Digital Rights Foundation also released a list of recommendations for policy makers and law enforcement.

""These [recommendations] cover issues of the Federal Investigation Agency's (FIA) accessibility especially during the pandemic, and also how technology needs to be used hand in hand while dealing with digital harassment cases, like allowing for video testimonies,"" it said.","['Dr. Salaria', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Mansur Ul Haque', 'B Gates', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/817876/poverty-in-s-africa-three-cows-and-a-forced-marriage,12/13/09 0:00,Poverty in S. Africa: three cows and a forced marriage,"PALMERTON (South Africa) Nolizwi Sinama was 14 years old when her family swapped her for three cows and forced her into marrying a man three times her age.

Now staying at a local shelter for abused youth, the shy teenager fidgets nervously and fights back the tears as she talks about her three-year ordeal, during which she was raped daily.

Her family abandoned her at the house of her new “husband,” a 42-year-old widower from KwaCele village, in a once-forgotten practice that is now being revived by poor, rural South African families desperate for money.

Sinama's case mirrors that of hundreds of other girls in rural parts of the impoverished Eastern Cape province, where nearly 200,000 people live on less than a dollar a day.

The ancient marriage custom, called ukuthwalwa, meaning “to be carried” in the Xhosa language, is a pre-arranged act where a man who had tried in vain to court a woman resorts to forcing her into marriage.

In the past the victim was normally an adult, but now men as old as 60 are abducting pubescent girls and forcing them into illegal customary marriages, outraging cultural activists and welfare authorities.

“It all happened too fast,” said Sinama, who now stays at a local shelter.

“One day I was a normal girl attending school, the next day I was living with an unknown family and an old man who forced me to have sex with him daily.”

“I could not go back home, my grandmother told me never to come back. They sold the cows and got money,” she added.

Now 17, she escaped her tormented married life in July and found solace at Palmerton care centre, which has also become a home to 18 other teenage girls who escaped similar situations.

They were rescued by welfare officials and police in a campaign to stem the practice, even though many communities see nothing wrong with it.

Most of the girls say their abductions were pre-arranged with their parents and left them no say in the process.

In many cases, girls are forced out of school and bear children, when they are barely out of puberty.

“He raped me on our first night together. Every day he forced himself on me, in all the cases he overpowered me after a struggle,” said Sinama, who now has a two-year-old boy by the man.

“I love my child and I am going to raise him to be a good man.”

Captain Nomana Adonis from Mthontsasa police station, which leads a rescue campaign in villages around the area of Lusikisiki, said the abductions were a new phenomenon.

“This is new. We believe there may be hundreds of other girls out there we did not reach,” said Adonis.

“We have encountered girls as young as 13 who were sold to old men, opening them to chances of contracting diseases like HIV.”

She said a number of “husbands” and parents had been arrested.

“In most case the husbands are charged with rape and abduction, but so far we have not secured a single conviction,” said Adonis.

Peter Mtuze, a retired academic and the former head of African Languages at Rhodes University, decried the unothordox revival of ukuthwalwa, saying it did not fit in the modern world.

“Children are literally being sold, almost to the highest bidder. This is paedophilia,” said Mtuze.

“In the old days men usually abducted women who were of marriage age, not minors. This is not culture,” said Mtuze, adding that in the past, girls who were abducted were not raped.

“The girl was kept safe until she accepted the love proposal from the man. Messengers were then sent to the parents of the girl to start lobola (dowry) talks,” said Mtuze.

He said the custom was practised secretly by a number of tribes in African countries.

Both the government of South Africa and the Human Rights Commission (HRC) have condemned the practice, saying it has no place in a modern society.

“This custom is taking us backwards as a country. We are doing our best to stop it and protect the children,” said Phearane Moreroa, head of HRC.—AFP","['Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1564313,6/18/20 14:31,"Policeman shoots, injures Karachi doctor allegedly after being denied sleeping pills","A policeman shot and injured a doctor at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) in Karachi late on Wednesday night allegedly over not being prescribed sleeping pills.

Police said that initial investigation reports suggested that the police constable, who was posted at CTD Civil Lines, shot and injured Dr Fahad Hussain in the emergency ward of the hospital over not getting sleeping pills the previous night by another doctor who had advised him not to take such drugs.

CTD senior official Raja Umer Khattab said that the police constable had been suffering from chest pains for the last 15-20 days. He got tested at Ziauddin Hospital and was diagnosed with typhoid. He visited the NICVD on Tuesday night where the security guard prevented him from entering and asked him to wear a mask first.

After an argument with the guard, the police constable managed to get a mask from someone and entered the emergency ward where he reportedly asked the doctor for sleeping pills as he hadn't slept for three days. Khattab said that the doctor did not give him the medicines upon which the constable went back home.

He returned to the hospital on Wednesday night and asked about the same doctor. The official said that when the police constable found out that doctor was not available, he opened fire on another doctor (Fahad) and managed to escape. Khattab said that after the incident, the suspect visited CTD Civil Lines where he behaved strangely and told his colleagues that he had shot the doctor.

Khattab said he asked police personnel to detain him, adding that the CTD police later handed him over to Saddar police for the investigation. Quoting the suspect's family and colleagues, the CTD official said he believed that lately the detained policeman had become “emotionally disturbed”.

Dr Fahad suffered two bullet wounds in his legs and his condition was said to be out of danger. The police have registered a first information report (FIR) against the police constable under section 324 (attempt to commit qatl-i-amd) of the Pakistan Penal Code on complaint of the wounded doctor.

The complainant in his statement to the police said that he was performing his duty in the emergency ward when a man came and asked him as to whether the doctor from the previous night was there. Fahad said that he told him he didn't know about the doctor's whereabouts upon which the suspect started alleging that “you (doctors) are dishonest and I will not spare you” and shot at both his legs before fleeing.","['Imtiaz Ali', 'Gm Bughio', 'Dr. Salaria', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Mustafa Tai', 'Justice First', 'Chrís Dăń', 'Dr Tarik', 'Tiddi Raja', 'Azam']","A policeman shot and injured a doctor at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) in Karachi late on Wednesday night allegedly over not being prescribed sleeping pills.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1395215,3/20/18 7:15,Special report: Sexual harassment in workplaces in Pakistan,"Misogyny in the workplace: Hidden in plain sight By Razeshta Sethna, Tooba Masood and Ramsha Jahangir Sexual harassment, abuse and discrimination in Pakistan’s workplaces, including universities, are pervasive, mostly unreported and ignored by senior managers, a Dawn survey of 300 women found. In response to being asked whether women were made to stay silent about workplace harassment, 61 per cent said their employers did not coerce them to keep quiet, but a significant 35pc were told to remain silent by their colleagues and bosses. The survey conducted through online questionnaires and interviews in Karachi, Islamabad, Lahore, Peshawar and Quetta collated responses from women in the workforce, across professions and industries, to gauge experiences of sexual harassment and whether workplaces have anti-sexual harassment policies in place. Nonetheless, when it comes to formal reporting mechanisms, testimonies from women suggest most lack faith in the process — only 17pc of those who experienced harassment approached their organisation’s internal inquiry committees. Despite 59pc reporting that their managements do take harassment seriously, most women expressed worry that managers wouldn’t sanction harassers and their work situations would not improve. Most women felt they would not be believed during investigations or when perpetrators had support in high places. A surgeon’s proposition Women in medicine shared stories of a toxic culture of misogyny. Some as students endured catcalling, comments about their body size (“they would rate us on a scale of one to ten,” said one) and gossip about their reputation. Some doctors said promotions were denied on the pretext that they were ‘less experienced’, not ‘as committed’ as male colleagues or because they didn’t succumb to sexual demands. Those who call out workplace misconduct are routinely portrayed as hysterical and malicious liars or whiners. One former medical student of a university hospital said her professor, a well-known orthopaedic surgeon, often paid her unwanted attention. Once, he propositioned her while she was operating on a patient under his supervision. “He stood so close to me, shoulder-to-shoulder in the operating room. He told me I’d have to come back to him if I cut my finger while operating. No one knows when you wear [surgical] masks what a doctor is whispering to you,” she said. “Female students would invariably get higher marks than male students. He had power over students he favoured. We knew his behaviour was problematic, so did our seniors, but by complaining we’d be jeopardising our careers. We were given warnings about some professors and male students we should steer clear of. It was a very uncomfortable environment. I hated it.” Hostile work environments Bad behaviour doesn’t have to be sexual to constitute harassment. In fact, everyday aggressions by male bosses often create humiliating work conditions for female subordinates. Women in technology speak of how managers denigrate their worth and work; improper touching and comments, bullying; and bosses taking credit for their achievements. Schoolteachers talk of promotions promised in return for sexual favours. One said she was publicly mocked for using the bathroom ‘too often’. Politicians said they are routinely criticised for their appearance — they must not look too feminine since that’s not associated with leadership, nor too masculine since that’s not their lot. Being perceived as usurping power in a man’s world makes them fair game, they said. Even legislative assemblies in which pro-women laws are sanctified are not safe from everyday sexism. Sexism in parliament In January 2017, PML-F’s Nusrat Sehar Abbasi was well into her second tenure in the Sindh assembly and accustomed to the frequent jeering and heckling by certain male legislators from the ruling party. Nonetheless, she decided enough was enough when PPP’s Imdad Pitafi invited her to come to his chamber for a ‘satisfactory response’ to a question she had asked, which prompted laughter from other members of the ruling party. She even threatened to immolate herself if he did not resign. “I didn’t get what he said at first because of the poor acoustics, not until other women told me. I wasn’t given the chance to respond because PPP’s deputy speaker Shehla Raza switched off my mike; she didn’t stand in my defence. I was fed up with the constant whistling and bad language used by male legislators,” Abbasi tells Dawn. “They believe women on reserved seats [are not elected] on our own merit. They don’t realise we do most of the work and pass the most bills, while they heckle us.” Pitafi eventually apologised on the floor of the house, after Bilawal and Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari urged him to do so. This was not an isolated incident. Many women lawmakers suffer inappropriate banter intended to publicly demean them. In June 2016, then defence minister Khawaja Asif called PTI’s Shireen Mazari a ‘tractor trolley’; in April 2017, PPP’s Khurshid Shah remarked that women would ‘fall ill’ if prevented from ‘chattering’; in Nov 2014, JUI-F’s Fazlur Rehman claimed PTI’s female supporters were of ‘bad character’. Failing to condemn this behaviour, women lawmakers mostly support their parties for fear of censure by male leaders. Enabling misconduct When women protect harassers they are actually ‘enabling’ these men and their misconduct, explains Nighat Dad of the Digital Rights Foundation. “Society is wired in such ways because of the stakes involved; even if you might know of their behaviour you will stay silent. Networks empower people and people don’t want to lose their communities. Often harassers are weaker but enablers allow them to become strong so they stay within communities and are not isolated. You won’t see these powerful enablers around complainants often so they become weak and isolated.” Silence and secrecy enforce perpetrators. If a woman cannot be completely silenced, they make sure she is disbelieved or shamed, say lawyers dealing with harassment cases. The more powerful the perpetrator, the more he is able to discredit the victim through his network of supporters. In the line of duty Senior police officer Maria Taimur admits women in the force won’t talk about harassment as much as they should. “At a higher level we don’t face intimidation as much, but lower entry-level constables and ASIs do. Women in the force can go to their DPOs or CPOs to complain, and have learnt to give men shut up calls. But often the matter is also hushed up. We have anti-harassment drives in most districts, we try to change mindsets, but it’s a slow process,” she said. Taimur raised another issue: “You can’t spot a harasser because often their demeanour is so respectful in public. This makes it easier for them to cover their tracks.” Having worked with male colleagues for over 12 years, Uzma, an ASI at Lahore’s Lower Mall police station is well versed in their psyche. “Tharak jhaartay hain aadat se majboor,” — they flirt out of habit — she said. Although women in the force can hold their own, she admits certain men try to cast them as being of ill repute. “What rubbish. Women work because they need to.” Still, women facing harassment are often caught between two bad choices. Put up or get out Of the women surveyed, more than half said they would leave their jobs if harassed. For 12pc, reactions of workplaces and families would determine whether they stayed. But many recognise that ignoring harassment or leaving the workplace altogether will only exacerbate the problem. “If it’s not one woman, then it’s another, which is why predators need to be held accountable,” said one interviewee. One of the Punjab ombudsperson’s first cases was a complaint from a junior clerk in the agriculture department in 2014, recollected Bushra Khaliq of Women in Struggle for Empowerment. The only woman in her office, for six months, her colleagues maligned her reputation, told dirty jokes in her presence and blew cigarette smoke in her face. “When the department failed to take her seriously, her family went to the police. Eleven people were nominated in the complaint, and each was given different levels of punishment.” But such an outcome is still an anomaly. In interviews, women explained how disciplinary action against harassers is virtually non-existent in a society where powerful men are immune from censure: “They usually get a slap on the wrist at most.” A law unto themselves One lawyer talked of misbehaviour in her profession: “My [former] boss, an influential former Senator and lawyer-politiian, made unwanted sexual advances, told me that at the civil courts women lawyers are sold for Rs500, and that he had slept with many ‘pretty women parliamentarians’. Once he tried to hug me, and when I told him specifically that this was not okay, he said his last employee was a tomboy and never hesitated to hug him. I left that law chamber.” Recalling her early days, another lawyer wrote of a senior colleague, a son of a high court judge, who would send her dozens of inappropriate, late-night text messages. “I never replied and would greet him the next day at work, pretending they had never happened. … The firm had no anti-harassment policy or procedure … I was made to believe that this was a rite of passage and that the messages would stop. … After I quit, I received another text from him calling me a slut.” Obstacles in enforcing workplace rights “Sexual harassment is a question of power and authority over women. The Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act is aimed essentially at behaviour correction, it doesn’t involve courts or the police directly,” states Khaliq. With its enactment and the amendment to Pakistan Penal Code Section 509, both in 2010, the real challenge is implementation. Legal experts argue that though sexual harassment in public spaces is now punishable with imprisonment and/or a fine, it has not served its purpose given the criminal justice system’s shortfalls. Meanwhile, although the civil law requires organisations to adopt a code of conduct and constitute internal inquiry committees, organisations often fail to implement it. “They don’t say they won’t comply, but some public organisations don’t. It was a nightmare to get PTV to nominate a committee. Banks, on the other hand, are more compliant because it is part of the State Bank’s audit,” explains Maliha Hassain of Mehergah. Under this law, if a complainant is not satisfied with the internal committee, they can approach their respective ombudsperson for cases of workplace harassment. But, eight years on, the only provincial ombudsperson’s post that is presently filled is Sindh’s — Punjab has had no ombudsperson since April 2017. And while compliance with rulings is almost universal according to former federal ombudsperson for harassment, retired justice Yasmin Abbasey, she admits that the high courts have sometimes issued stay orders to stop proceedings despite lacking the jurisdiction to do so. “Granted, it is risky for women to talk because of lack of supportive mechanisms. But they are more aware and understand they don’t need to tolerate this. The #MeToo conversations are trickling down to the grass roots,” Khaliq says. And what of the effects of these conversations? Of her own profession, Abbasi believes that speaking up will help to ensure that “the path for younger women to enter politics is not as difficult”. Uzma Al-Karim, former special adviser to the Sindh ombudsperson, believes only a mindset change will make workplaces safer for women. But, until then, “We have to enforce the law so that there is zero tolerance for all forms of harassment in a work environment.” Sanam Zeb, Asma Mojiz, Xari Jalil, Sarah Eleazar, Waseem Ahmed Shah, and Sadia Qasim Shah contributed to reporting. *Illustrations by Marium Ali If you are facing sexual harassment at work and would like to file a complaint, please follow the government's guidelines here and here.

Breaking the silence on sexism in academia By Razeshta Sethna, Sara Eleazar, Waseem Ahmed Shah and Tooba Masood For too long, sexism and sexual harassment in Pakistan’s universities have been considered routine experiences, tolerated by those in authority. Believing that the consequences of taking action are more damaging than staying silent, most women continue to put up with harassment and misconduct. This was the choice Navin G Haider confronted two years ago as assistant professor of history at Karachi University’s (KU) Pakistan Study Centre. She decided to formally report on the harassment she experienced on campus, not knowing what the consequences would be (the first harassment incident she reported was in February 2016, and then, another incident she suffered on 14 March of the same year.) Calling out harassment and discrimination became a noose around Navin Haider's neck. Haider decided to file a complaint to the university’s internal inquiry committee after Dr Jaffer Ahmed — then acting centre director, and her immediate boss — failed to take action against her alleged offender, a visiting faculty member teaching Urdu, Dr Sahar Ansari (Ahmed, who has known Ansari for decades, told Haider’s friend, an academic from a private university, that he was ‘neutral’ to both parties.) In her complaint, Haider alleged Ansari twice harassed her in the form of unwanted and inappropriate physical contact. Although she took a route rarely pursued by victims for fear of backlash, Haider says she was unprepared for what followed. With 27 years of teaching experience, she was now labelled a troublemaker — even a nuisance by KU’s top management. Calling out harassment and discrimination became a noose around her neck. Yet, as she soon discovered, she was not the only woman who had been harassed by Ansari. Haider says Ansari must have been around while she was a student at KU in the 1980s, but she rarely crossed his path until he began teaching Urdu at the centre in 2002. There, too, they hardly interacted. “My limited interaction with Dr Ansari can be traced to December 2015 when he came into my room, sat on a chair next to me to look at student theses he could possibly use for an Urdu magazine for which he had just been appointed editor,” she says. In an interview with Dawn, Ansari claims, “Through the years we were friendly as colleagues could be. She told me she would get me work on a translation project at the Ismaili community centre in 2000. [In other words] there were ample chances for me take any liberties [with her] if I wanted to. But at this age [reportedly mid-70s] and with my background I would not.” Haider says she was unaware of what she stated was Ansari’s apparent predilection for fair-skinned women until she filed her complaint and other alumni and students begun to speak of their experiences with him. She learnt that he took their numbers on the pretext of contacting them about academic work, and instead called them incessantly at night — asking them out to lunch, commenting on their physical appearance and marriage eligibility. Some claimed he had groped them. A male staffer corroborated this. “A computer operator at the centre told me he had witnessed how Ansari swept his hand right from the top of a woman’s shoulders to her buttocks. He was also one of the many witnesses who recorded his statement during the official inquiry,” Haider tells Dawn. “In fact, Dr Ahmed’s wife and the centre’s current director had also warned her female students — I teach the same students in my history classes — to keep their distance from Dr Ansari. Something these girls told much later. Boys in his class knew he’d grade girls’ exams higher if they flirted with him,” she explains. Haider’s ground level office — a tiny room packed with books and papers — is at the end of a drab, quiet corridor. It was here around noon one day in February 2016 that Ansari, without knocking, walked in while she was at her desk, engrossed in work. He strode right up to her, grabbed her hands in a tight handshake, and would not let go. “It is friendship day, he told me. Besides, I like you beyond work, he said to me,” Haider says. Ansari explains he was being friendly, not inappropriate, by shaking hands. As the second inquiry committee ruling (a copy of which is available with Dawn) in January 2018 noted, Ansari denied that standing too close to a woman, hugging or touching her hands would make her feel uneasy and be inappropriate. He asserts he was made a scapegoat by Haider, who was displeased with Ahmed’s way of handling the centre’s affairs. The ‘troublemaker’ complains Even though her boundaries had been violated, Haider knew it was pointless complaining to the director. “I was angry and vulnerable at this point for reasons concerning my work and promotions as well. I knew he was a friend of the acting director and that meant I should stay quiet. I would be called a liar if I spoke out. What evidence did I have? Also, being concerned about the manner in which contract faculty was hired and their tenure extended, I had written a letter to the university’s board of governors outlining corrupt practices in 2014, so I was perceived as a troublemaker internally,” she says. Instead, she avoided him. She kept her office door locked, she recalls, and would avoid the library where Ansari would tutor mostly female students after class. On March 14, 2016 Haider went to Ahmed’s office to discuss something when she spotted Ansari leaving the same office. She moved aside to make way for him, she said, but instead of walking past her to the door, he grabbed her by the shoulders and shoved her against the director’s personal assistant’s table (the assistant was out for lunch at the time). Holding on to her shoulders, he said, “Aap hichkicha kiu rahi ahin?” (“Why are you hesitant?”) Horrified, Haider’s reaction was to yell, “What are you doing? Are you mad? Do you have no shame?” Humiliated and stressed, she reported the incident to Ahmed that very afternoon, after which she submitted a written complaint to the university’s vice chancellor. When Haider’s complaint was investigated by an internal inquiry committee (a committee member, for instance, was Ansari’s former student Dr Seemi Tahir) it absolved him of all charges in May 2016. Despite testimonies furnished by alumni and students about Ansari’s misconduct, in its judgment (a copy of which is available with Dawn) it recommended that “[Haider] should be asked to improve her temperament”. “They concluded I was insane,” she says. It further stated that she “unnecessarily provoked the students towards agitation and boycott to settle her personal problem”. In June 2016, she filed an appeal against this decision with the office of retired justice Shahnawaz Tariq, the provincial ombudsperson for the protection against harassment of women, explaining the inquiry committee had disregarded witness testimonies (16 people reporting harassment by Ansari had come forward), and failed to record statements and cross-examine both parties — all of which are legally binding. Noting these discrepancies, the ombudsperson wrote to KU in August 2017 asking that a second committee “of independent, impartial and honest” officers submit a report in 30 days. Noting that “any unpermitted and unconsented touch of the body of a female by any male is amounting to cause harassment”, the ombudsperson’s decision stated: “Neither the Inquiry Committee had made transparency nor ensured the impartiality while conducting the inquiry proceedings as well as passing its decision.” In January 2018, a second committee headed by Dr Nasreen Aslam Shah ruled that Ansari behaved inappropriately with Haider. Its findings noted all witness statements about Ansari’s reputation for the type of attention he paid his female students. The report (a copy is available with Dawn) stated no one regardless of their age, profession or fame has the right to harass another person on campus or otherwise. Also, incidents such as these will deter women from studying at KU unless strict action is taken against harassers, it elaborated. Denying he had touched Haider outside the director’s office, Ansari claims: “She wanted to create a law and order situation in [the director’s] centre. If I had held her shoulders, why did she not push me away? Isn’t that unnatural — she didn’t yell? … She is bold, an activist … She is stout and healthy, and I am a semi-handicapped person.” During an interview with Dawn, Ansari was asked twice if he had expected Haider to push him back. He responded in the affirmative both times — only if he attempted to touch her shoulders, he added suddenly, asserting he had not touched her. Defining harassment in Punjab Based on data collected from 260 students from 12 departments, a 2017 study in the Research Journal of South Asian Studies highlights the pervasiveness of harassment at Punjab University, including one incident that received much media attention. “Two years ago, the termination of the services of a professor … who reportedly kept a bedroom next to his office on university premises, was initially applauded. However, recently, despite the university’s resistance, he has returned to the university due to political pressure.” Clarifying the above, Dr Zakaria Zakar told Dawn the accused professor had not returned, but the court had restored his pension benefits as he had retired during the same time. Before being appointed interim VC this year, Zakar headed the committee for investigating harassment complaints. According to him, students’ complaints about verbal harassment on campus, such as catcalling, do not fall under the purview of the Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, as the law primarily provides cover to employees. His interpretation of the law — including the definition of workplace sexual harassment and whom it should apply to — is antithetical to the views expressed by competent authorities such as the federal ombudsperson, who ruled: “The fact remains that work means physical and mental effort or activity directed to the production or accomplishment of something that one is doing, making or performing especially as an occupation or undertaking a duty or a task therefore, the act equally applies to employer, employee and students.” Across the country, many within academia have reported that the most common harassment they face is ogling, sexual and vulgar comments, and unwanted touching. All felt angry and degraded though many are shamed and blamed; many researchers and teachers leave their jobs, while students are forced to endure continued harassment if they want to finish their degrees. Many more try to ignore the harassment and avoid the harasser. In April 2017, over 50 students (mostly female) signed a petition against four students at the Government College Lahore claiming verbal harassment at a bus stop. After several months of initial hearings, an inquiry committee comprising only men was established, which goes against the law: one woman on a minimum three-member committee is mandatory. According to sources privy to the hearings, the questions posed to students ranged from irrelevant to downright absurd, while the committee only appeared sympathetic after one of the complainants burst into tears. The questions included: “You have stated that you were walking to the bus and plugging in your hands-free device when one of the boys cat-called you. Why were you using a hands-free device?” and “How do you know [the harassers’] names? You found out from Facebook? Why are you on Facebook?” Fighting against a powerful harasser Even though the law is clear that sexual harassment is discrimination, a violation of rights and therefore illegal, perpetrators do not face the full force of the law. The appointment of Saqlain Naqvi as VC of Bacha Khan University (BKU) in Charsadda is under review in the Peshawar High Court (PHC) for these very reasons. In a December 2016 judgment by the federal ombudsperson, Naqvi was censured for sexual harassment while dean of the faculty of sciences at Arid Agriculture University in Rawalpindi. A researcher complained that his behaviour was the reason for the 10-month delay in her PhD thesis examination, because of which she had not been awarded her degree. Although she attended only one course with Naqvi, his extraordinary attention towards her made her extremely uneasy. He made it untenable for her to stay, and so she quit the university. Denying the allegations, BKU’s management told the PHC that the Rawalpindi bench of the Lahore High Court set the ombudsperson’s decision aside on April 18, 2017. However, the petitioner’s counsel told Dawn that the LHC had set aside the ombudsperson’s order on technical grounds and referred the issue to the Punjab provincial ombudsperson, as Arid University was not in the federal ombudsperson’s jurisdiction. It had not referred to the merits of the case. With no ombudsperson appointed in Punjab, the case remains in limbo. In interviews, professors and students have told Dawn they are either dissuaded from making officials complaints, withdraw their allegations or ignore serial offenders fearing the impact on their education and careers. Students harassed by male professors who have authority over them, including the power to manipulate grades, are often intimidated by the consequences of reporting. A former student at a private university narrates her experience. There are cases where some senior male faculty attempt to trade grades for sexual favours. At the University of Peshawar, there are no well-established mechanisms for addressing complaints, says Noreen Naseer, a professor of political science in a faculty dominated by male staff. There are cases where some senior male faculty attempt to trade grades for sexual favours. As a senior female staff member, she feels responsible for younger students, often warning them to stay away from those known for predatory behaviour. When a student was heard screaming in a professor’s office, the entire department was aware because she ran out crying, Naseer tells Dawn. The professor claimed he had asked her to take off her hijab so he could identify her. An investigative committee was formed, but the teacher is still on campus. “Because he belonged to the Jamaat-i-Islami the case was hushed up, even though other parties protested on campus. The woman got scared and didn’t pursue it,” she says. Women told Dawn that when they do complain, in most cases universities downplay any wrongdoing and seek to keep matters quiet to protect their own reputation. A teacher at a private university in Karachi discusses the power dynamics contributing to workplace harassment However ironic, it is often conservatism that deters potential perpetrators from pursuing and harassing women in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The fear that he will be killed by a woman’s male relatives might be one restraining factor, explains Naseer, but clearly not enough to keep older men away from young students. One professor on condition of anonymity said she even threatened to throw a senior professor in her department “out the window” if he didn’t stop harassing a young student who had come to her not knowing what to do. “I was so angry at him for pursuing a 19-year-old student. There was no other way to get the message to him so I said what I did. Inexperienced younger women feel older men paying them attention is all good, not knowing it involves much more. I requested he let her finish her studies; stay away from her because she was uninterested in him. He would send her vulgar, bold messages — becoming demanding. She refused to press charges. This wasn’t the first time he had intimidated a woman into having sexual contact with him. And he had high-level contacts. But when your provincial assembly is sitting on bills to protect women, what can you do?” she says. The cost of staying silent Repressed anger accompanied with the trauma of harassment leads to psychological problems, says Kashif Faraz Ahmed, chairperson of the applied psychology department at the Government Islamia College Civil Lines, at a recent seminar. Because of the way harassment complaints are often dealt with, victims end up blaming themselves leading to low self-esteem and mental and physical health issues — especially if the case becomes public. Feminist activist Aimen Bucha explains, “Just because you have never seen it happen or haven’t harassed anyone, doesn’t mean that this doesn’t happen”. Even then, it is hard to uncover the real scale of harassment on campuses. Our research points to a culture of impunity protecting powerful offenders. Victims, meanwhile, feel anger, remorse, shame and guilt — even when they do complain. It’s a boys’ club so that’s the bigger battle I doubt I will win,

says Navin Haider “Unfortunately, behaviours which may constitute inappropriate conduct are normalised in society; victims who have not been physically assaulted are not considered victims of harassment,” says psychologist Mary Pervaiz. Dealing with the consequences of calling out predatory behaviour is tantamount to silent suffering. “It’s a boys’ club so that’s the bigger battle I doubt I will win,” Haider says. Though reconciled with her choices, she has already paid a price for her bold stance. Nearing retirement, her chances of getting a promotion are virtually non-existent; she has suffered a personal loss while fighting her case and her health is affected. Women who do not stay silent know that unwittingly allowing such things to happen will not create change in workplaces. Though the cost of going public is high, it will translate into long-lasting change, they say — only then will the fundamental attitude of society towards women undergo transformation. These voices heard will only upend power relations.

Improving the workplace for women Interview by Aasma Mojiz Retired Justice Yasmin Abbasey, former federal ombudsperson for protection against harassment of women at the workplace, talks to Dawn about the ambit of the anti-harassment law. What kind of behaviour constitutes workplace harassment according to the Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010? YA) The perception that this law only deals with direct [physical] sexual harassment — which is often not possible in the office — is not the case. There are many forms of harassment in the workplace that are all covered in the law. Harassment does not just mean in terms of physical or sexual assault. It also means unnecessarily interfering in the work of others by harming their progress or promotion. Men tend to submit complaints of hostile work environments; women also have the same issues, where there is so much interference in their work that they are not able to perform, and that interference is affecting their career. This law does in fact apply to both men and women in the workplace. However, most cases are women reporting harassment by male colleagues. What kind of workplace environment do women contend with? YA) Women in key positions usually do not face problems. They have gone through a process, they are at a position; they can handle the situation. But at the lower level, they do face problems. If there were no problems for women, this law would not have been made. Until now, harassment in the workplace has been ignored. But it is a painful experience for those affected and that is something that was not given credence in society; women felt it, but society did not. Besides specific incidents, women also face uncomfortable workplace environments. How do you combat something like that? YA) Harassment also applies to the kind of environment that makes women uncomfortable. During my tenure, the kind of cases that emerged meant I tried to evolve the law through my judgments. I have tried through my judgments to send a message that if you are spreading false rumours about someone, for example, that also constitutes harassment. It is not in writing, but you are spreading something baseless about another colleague — even if it is not",,,,,,,,,,,,dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/846465/zardari-signs-bill-harassment-of-women-is-now-a-crime,3/10/10 0:00,Zardari signs bill: Harassment of women is now a crime,"ISLAMABAD, March 9 President Asif Ali Zardari signed on Tuesday the Protection Against Harassment of Women at Workplace Bill, 2010, aimed at providing a safe working environment.

The president signed the bill at a ceremony attended by some 100 women activists, parliamentarians and members of civil society organisations in the presidency.

He reiterated the government's commitment to ensuring equal rights for men and women in accordance with the Constitution.

“We have to create a Pakistan where the coming generations, my daughters, can be proud of the fact that they live as equals. We will make sure that those who wish to harm the ideology of the Quaid-i-Azam, which was for equality for men and women, shall not succeed,” he said.

The president, invoking the name of Benazir Bhutto, said “We shall do our utmost by the end of this tenure. All the rights that we enjoy as men shall be enjoyed by women as well.”He recalled the commitment made by Ms Bhutto at the Beijing Conference and in the CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, adopted in 1979 by the UN General Assembly) document, and urged the government to seek guidance from her vision to achieve gender equality.Mr Zardari recalled the struggle and sacrifices of Benazir Bhutto and said she was a symbol of strength, bravery and courage. “My wife was much stronger than me. She left a legacy for us to follow even she is guiding us from her grave.”

He said she coined the slogan “democracy is the best revenge” and said the whole philosophy of the Pakistan People's Party revolved around that phrase - that not revenge, but freedom is the revenge.

He mentioned how Ms Bhutto would have felt when she walked into Sukkur jail at the age of 21 as she tried to fight for her imprisoned father.

“Fighting like no other person I have ever seen. And throughout her life she made sure that the legacy which her father gave life for stayed alive.”

He said history might remember him as a person who was “living a woman's dream”. It was her dream that a woman in power would bring in the soft touch that the world needed amidst too much horror and said “what we need to emulate is gentleness, perseverance and the quality to bear pain”.

The president said both his sisters were members of parliament, while her two daughters would be back after completing their studies to serve the nation, along with their brother.

He paid rich tribute to the women who over the generations had strived for their rights since long and described them as “really a tribute to God's divine creation.”

He also lauded the role of women which they played in history and said all religions accord them due regard, dignity and honour.

“Let us mobilise the collective power of women to help make our country, the region and the world more tolerant and secure for all,” he said.

The bill aimed at creating a working environment for women free from harassment, abuse and intimidation, he added.

He thanked all those who supported the bill in both houses.

Mr Zardari said the struggle for the rights of women in Pakistan had been long and difficult.

“We believe in equal rights and equal opportunities for men and women,” he added.

“On this occasion I urge all ministries to get going and adopt the code of conduct within a month, as laid down in this act,” the president directed.

“I also urge the private sector to cooperate in the implementation of this act, in letter and spirit,” he said.

The bill was unanimously passed by the National Assembly on Jan 21 and by the Senate on Feb 26.

Shahnaz Wazir Ali, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Social Welfare, recalled the process of drafting the legislation.

The Alliance Against Sexual Harassment (Aasha), a civil society organisation, which has been working on the issue, has described the signing of the bill a milestone for women.

Aqsa Khan of Aasha said “This is a true partnership of citizens and the government. We want the government to ensure its implementation.”

She said “Pakistan now stands as a leading country in South Asia for having a specific legislation against sexual harassment at workplace.”

Dr Fouzia Saeed, a woman activist who remained engaged with the process for two years, said “The government has honoured its commitment for a progressive social legislation. This is a breakthrough and we expect continued support to other such laws to make society more civilised and accountable.”

She said in a statement that women activists were thankful to Shahnaz Wazir Ali, Sherry Rehman, Raza Rabbani, Senate Chairman Farooq H. Naek and senior leadership of the PPP. She said they were also very proud of members of the Awami National Party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement and many progressive parliamentarians of the Pakistan Muslim League-Q and the PML-N.

Overcoming years of conservative opposition, the National Assembly passed the bill to punish harassment of women at workplaces, though last-minute amendments extended the protection to men as an apparent compromise.

Punishment for the guilty, or violators of a code of conduct, will range from a censure to dismissal to an unspecified fine under the law.

The law defines harassment as “any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favours or other verbal and written communication or physical conduct of a sexual nature or sexually demeaning attitudes, causing interference with the work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, or the attempt to punish the complainant for refusal to comply to such a request or is made condition for employment.”

All organisations, including federal and provincial government ministries, departments, corporations, educational institutions, private commercial organisations and registered civil society associations, will be required to constitute inquiry committees of at least three members each - one of them a woman - to probe complaints and give their findings within 30 days to the competent authority concerned that will award recommended penalties.

Minor penalties will be censure, withholding for specified periods of promotion or increment and stoppage at an efficiency bar in the time-scale, other than fitness to cross such bar, and recovery of compensation payable to a complainant from pay or any other source of the accused.

Major penalties are demotion to a lower post or time-scale or to a lower stage in a time-scale, compulsory retirement, removal from service, dismissal from service, and fine, a part of which can be used as compensation for the complainant. “In case of owner (found guilty), the fine shall be payable to the complainant.”

An inquiry committee may recommend to an ombudsperson for appropriate action against a complainant whose allegations are found to be false and made with mala fide intentions while a party aggrieved by the decision of the competent authority may prefer appeal to the ombudsperson to be appointed by the federal or a provincial government.

Appeals against the decisions of an ombudsperson at the federal level can be made to the president and at provincial level to the governor concerned.

The statement of objects and reasons, accompanying the law, “is to create a safe working environment for workers which is free of sexual harassment, abuse and intimidation” with a view to enabling higher productivity and better quality of life at work.

“Sexual harassment is one of the biggest hurdles faced by working men and women, preventing many from working to get themselves and their families out of poverty,” the law says.","['Images Staff', 'Khurram Husain', 'F.S.

“Sexual harassment is one of the biggest hurdles faced by working men and women, preventing many from working to get themselves and their families out of poverty,” the law says.","['signs', 'sexual', 'president', 'society', 'pakistan', 'bill', 'zardari', 'harassment', 'rights', 'men', 'women', 'crime', 'working']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189f00b83e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0d52ba8a43.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d005917e0.jpg?0.8785461548197806', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd192bbacb28.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d719e1f62.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189916390d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0ec56aad75.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f0c8e29e4.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1b9ccb6c70.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18a3ece187.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fc7833a64a3a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1b7a7c513c.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f94d8916a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d6ce529d0.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f4142e469.jpg', 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}",TRUE,http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'ISLAMABAD, March 9 President Asif Ali Zardari signed on Tuesday the Protection Against Harassment of Women at...', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'http://beta.dawn.com/news/846465/zardari-signs-bill-harassment-of-women-is-now-a-crime', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Zardari signs bill: Harassment of women is now a crime', 'description': 'ISLAMABAD, March 9 President Asif Ali Zardari signed on Tuesday the Protection Against Harassment of Women at...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'http://beta.dawn.com/news/846465/zardari-signs-bill-harassment-of-women-is-now-a-crime', 'title': 'Zardari signs bill: Harassment of women is now a crime', 'description': 'ISLAMABAD, March 9 President Asif Ali Zardari signed on Tuesday the Protection Against Harassment of Women at...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2010-03-10 00:00:00', 'modified_time': '2010-03-10 00:00:00'}})",[],dawn

https://www.dawn.com/news/1579626,9/14/20 7:22,Motorway gang rape,"The gang-rape of a mother who was travelling in her car along with her two children on Lahore-Sialkot motorway speaks volumes about governance in Punjab.

How can a province with a population of 120 million be governed when its chief executive cannot get along with police chiefs and has removed five of them within a span of two years?

It is evident that he does not possess the ability or the acumen to lead the province. The law and order situation is in tatters and the morale of the police force has touched a new low. Criminal elements in our society take advantage of such an inept government.

This state of affairs prevails because Prime Minister Imran Khan insists on retaining the incumbent chief minister.

This takes me back many decades when the prime minister was captain of our cricket team.

He retained Mansoor Akhtar, a cricketer who never delivered when required. Mansoor was part of two World Cups, 1983 and 1987. He played eight innings and scored just 108 runs at an average of 13.5 runs per innings. The prime minister’s stubbornness in retaining a non-performing chief minister will cost the PTI heavily come the elections.

The gang-rape incident near Lahore toll plaza on Sialkot-Lahore motorway needs immediate attention of the authorities in many ways. Since its inauguration in March, this section of the motorway has been in the news for one reason or the other.

On this 91km motorway, there is no deployment of motorway police, no rest area, no petrol pump, no washroom, no drinking water facilities, and so on and so forth.

There are many illegal u-turns on this motorway which pose a serious risk to travellers’ lives. At places, the damaged fence allows the local bikers to make their way to travel on the motorway. Apart from the recent rape tragedy, this pathetic condition can cause accidents in the future as well.

This is the time to review and implement motorway management standard operating procedures to give commuters a safer and better travelling experience.

WHILE the shock that we received from the news of the rape and murder of a five-year-old girl had barely subsided that the incident of a young woman gang-raped on the motorway between Lahore to Gujranwala in front of her children has shocked us.

Has our society lost all morality and ethics?

To make matters worse, this portion of the highway has no security because it has not been assigned to the motorway police. Just think of the trauma inflicted on the victim and her children.

I am a pediatrician. When I examine the private parts of young children less than 10 years old, there is so much resistance on the part of child that I have to counsel and reassure them. All this is done while the parent is sitting close.

One can imagine the anguish and suffering the minor child who was raped as well as the young mother. The monsters who commit such heinous acts need to be dealt with severely.

Hospital sources said swabs of the body were taken for DNA test.","['minor', 'near', 'village', 'test', 'taken', 'bazai', 'tank', 'body', 'unidentified', 'fields', 'decomposed', 'boy']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3175651ed1.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd317cae34dd.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2dd0a4c9db.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd329902b790.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg', 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}",TRUE,http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'TANK: Decomposed body of seven-year-old boy was found near Bazai village in the jurisdiction of Shaheed Mureed Akbar...', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1579757', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Decomposed body of minor boy found in Tank', 'description': 'TANK: Decomposed body of seven-year-old boy was found near Bazai village in the jurisdiction of Shaheed Mureed Akbar...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1579757', 'title': 'Decomposed body of minor boy found in Tank', 'description': 'TANK: Decomposed body of seven-year-old boy was found near Bazai village in the jurisdiction of Shaheed Mureed Akbar...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-09-15 07:13:10', 'modified_time': '2020-09-15 07:13:10', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/116/a-correspondent'}, 'author': 'A Correspondent'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1590438,11/15/20 7:27,Special courts for speedy trial of rape cases planned,"ISLAMABAD: The government is all set to promulgate next week an ordinance seeking establishment of special courts for speedy trial of rape cases, suggesting steps for protection of witnesses and creating a separate prosecution network for this purpose.

This was said by Adviser to the Prime Minister on Parliamentary Affairs Babar Awan during an exclusive chat with Dawn hours after Prime Minister Imran Khan through a tweet announced that the government had planned to bring a “stringent and holistic anti-rape ordinance closing all loopholes”.

The prime minister had posted the tweet after talking to Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) of Sindh police Mohammad Bux Buriro on phone, who had played a major role with his daughter in the arrest of a man accused of raping a woman and her minor daughter in Kashmore.

Mr Awan, who is also a member of the Cabinet Committee on Legislative Cases, said the prime minister was very much concerned over the recent incidents of rape in different parts of the country.

He said the ordinance had been drafted in line with the prime minister’s directives to his legal team for preparing the law covering “four sides”, including protection of the victim so that her personal trauma could not become public and protection of witnesses.

Mr Awan said under the proposed law rape cases would not be investigated by ordinary police officials and only a gazzeted officer up to the level of DIG (deputy inspector general) or SSP (senior superintendent of police) would monitor these cases. He said the proposed law also suggested steps for speedy disposal of cases. He said in the last few years, over 21,000 rape cases were registered in the country and “only few hundreds of them could go for trial”.

To cover the loopholes and ensure timely justice, a new and separate prosecution network was being created, the adviser said.

Giving details, he said the properties of the convicts in such cases would be forfeited for paying compensation to the victims.

In order to create deterrence in the society, he said, “ultimate and stringent punishments” would be awarded to the culprits. He did not elaborate the measures which the law suggests for this purpose, but ruled out the option of public hanging as demanded by several political leaders, including some ministers.

Mr Awan said special courts would be set up in all the divisions to prevent delay in completion of the trials.

When his attention was drawn towards the criticism from the opposition over the government for relying on presidential ordinances for legislation, Mr Awan said the 18th Amendment had validated promulgation of ordinances which were considered “valid legislation” in many countries, including the US.

Moreover, he said, ordinances were promulgated when the parliament was not in session. He said since the parliament was not in session these days due to Covid-19 situation, ordinances could be promulgated by the government as per the constitution. And these ordinances, he added, eventually went to the parliament which finally enacted the laws.

As far as the opposition’s criticism was concerned, “the opposition loves and adores only one ordinance namely National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO),” he said in an apparent reference to the ordinance promulgated by the former military dictator Gen Pervez Musharraf in 2007 ending cases registered against people on political grounds.

Earlier, Prime Minister Imran Khan through his official social media account on Twitter lauded ASI Buriro and his daughter for showing bravery in the arrest of the Kashmore rape suspect.

“Spoke to ASI Buriro lauding his and his daughter’s exemplary initiative and courage in arrest of Kashmore rapist. The nation is proud of them and he has given positive uplift to image of police,” wrote the prime minister.

Sindh police had managed to arrest the alleged rapist of a woman and her four-year daughter in Kashmore with the help of ASI Buriro and his daughter, who trapped the main accused through a covert operation.

Speaking at a news conference in Karachi on Friday, Sindh government spokesperson Murtaza Wahab had said they would write to the Centre to bestow the highest police award on ASI Buriro and civil award on his daughter for the role they had played in arresting the main suspect.

The spokesperson’s comments came a day after a man was arrested for allegedly subjecting the woman and her minor daughter to rape for two days after duping the women with a job offer in northern Sindh’s Kashmore district.

Kashmore police had set up a trap by using a decoy, the daughter of ASI Buriro. The victim along with the ASI’s daughter contacted the main suspect over phone and invited him to a hotel where police arrested him.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1463990,2/17/19 7:52,"Shahrag, the Pakistani town where boys aren't safe from men","Sometimes, in some places, wherever you look, you can only see wolves pretending to be human.

The town of Shahrag is one such place.

Situated in a valley in Harnai district in Balochistan, Shahrag boasts “300 to 400” coal mines that are mined by “over 30,000 men.” There are children working the mines, too, but an official count does not exist.

The district is predominantly populated by Pashtuns but a sizeable population of Marri Baloch are also scattered across its mountainous areas. Pashtuns own the majority of tribal lands in Shahrag and also live in great numbers in the town. The southern part of the Shahrag tehsil is where coal-laden mountains exist. And it is also here that the Marris live and work.

“In Shahrag,” in the words of a local Pashtun dweller, “one cannot remain jobless thanks to these mountains. If someone brings 200 men to me this very instant, I can appoint them straight away at the coal mines.”

This is why most workers here are from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab. There is also a chunk of workers who come from across the Afghanistan border. Together, these constitute about 80 percent of the workforce while the remaining 20 percent workers are locals and Baloch, especially from the Marri tribe.

Shahrag in Balochistan is known as a coal-mining town. But it also hides an ugly secret

On the face of it, Shahrag is a traditionally patriarchal society and fairly religious, too. Women hardly come out of their homes and men tend to rule the roost around here.

But Shahrag is also completely cut off from the rest of Balochistan. Nobody there quite knows what is happening in the rest of the country. Nobody in the rest of the country cares much for Shahrag either.

In this isolation, Shahrag has managed to hide its big, ugly secret: its boys are not safe from its men.

In the name of 'responsibility'

When 13-year-old Kaleem* reached the coal mines from Dir earlier this year, he didn’t expect much fanfare upon his arrival. But a colony of miners was waiting for that day to arrive.

And as soon as he set foot on the Al-Gilani branch of the mountain, where some eight coal mines are situated, the excitement became tangible. News that Dir’s coal miners had brought in a new guy to the mines spread like wildfire. He became the talk of the town and even miners from other coal mines arrived to take a look at the new boy. Kaleem wasn’t quite the new bride but quickly became the new boy that many men were lusting after.

I left Shahrag city to head to the mountains early one day to meet Kaleem who I had been told about by locals. Along with about 20 others, including two boys around his age, Kaleem is housed in a mud-and-stone cottage at the top of a mountain. There are only two bedrooms and one kitchen. In the room where we sit down for a chat, there is no light other than whatever little comes from the burning stove.

Kaleem is wearing a black shalwar kameez over a yellow sports shirt. Fortunately, he is alone in the house at the time, around 3pm, because his elder colleagues are working “probably 1,700 feet below surface inside the coal pit.”

There is a big, black teapot on the stove filled with water which is boiling. He tells us that, over the last week, the weather has become frigid in Shahrag. Sitting alone next to the stove, he looks neat and clean, his black hair combed through the middle. After welcoming us, he does not utter a single word; instead, he goes out to wash two cups. Without saying a word, he pours black tea to serve us.

Kaleem is quite shy. He evades almost all questions put to him. After a series of monosyllabic answers, he blurts: “I do not have a father. I have come here to work to financially support my family back in Dir.”

What kind of work?

“I am a cook here,” he replies with a grim smile.

[Parents] turn a deaf ear to any complaints on the basis that these children are earning money ... This is why Shahrag’s children have “friendships” with people as old as their parents.

Kaleem has come to Shahrag to replace his brother. They are four brothers. According to him, they belong to a very poor family. He studied till primary back home but had to leave school because the family was reeling in poverty.

“All children, including me, work here because we either do not have elders [parents, uncles] or they are disabled and senile,” Kaleem adds. “I am paid 10,000 rupees monthly.”

Herein lies the ugly reality of Shahrag’s coal mines.

Children such as Kaleem are brought here from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and even from Afghanistan for the sole purpose of sexually abusing them. They are used as sexual partners by mature coal miners — these boys are either unable to say no to unwanted advances or need the cash offered in exchange for providing sexual services.

At first, even Kaleem does not want to talk about his situation. When asked if his body is used for sexual services, he does not reply. He simply leaves the room.

The first shift at the mines ends just after 3pm and the miners begin to emerge. All of them come to sit with us and we quickly change the discussion. The talk is now about the vulnerability felt by the coal miners in the mines. As we are about to leave, I spot Kaleem sitting on a big rock and chatting with a tall man.

“He [Kaleem] is their special guy,” relates a local miner accompanying me. “The monthly payment he is given is remuneration for satisfying their lust, not to work. They do not let him in the coal mine because he will get blackened.”

Such treatment is not meted out to Shah Farman*, a 16-year-old who arrived from Swat in 2017. Since then, he has been working as a coal cutter against a monthly salary of 35,000 rupees. But while he is at the mines, he has been routinely raped by adult men. Nobody bats an eyelid at what happens to Shah Farman almost every day. They tell me, “It’s all normal.”

Abuse as a way of life

Sexual abusers come in all forms and sizes. But they present themselves as ordinary human beings with an ordinary lifestyle.

For example, take Saqib*, a local coal miner in his early 40s. He is a tall man. There are white patches in his black beard and moustache. On the day we meet him, he wears a white cap and an old chador with which he has wrapped himself up. He has been in the mining business for the last 15 years.

Saqib meets us at a playground situated away from Shahrag city, near the Harnai road.

“The information you want to extract from me is strange,” he shouts when I ask him the question. “How can I tell you that we sexually abuse boys?”

But once he has settled down, he begins talking.

“Yes, I have had sex with boys in coal mines and even outside,” says Saqib. “This is not new. Swatis and other Afghans have chhothus [young sidekicks] who are their sexual partners. I do not have one because I am a local. I cannot afford that.”

The coal mines are approximately up to 6,000 feet deep. According to Saqib, children are also not spared there.

“We do have two to three children working inside the coal mines with us,” discloses Saqib, “At the time of coal cutting, deep inside the coal mines, we, the elder coal miners, have had sex with them, too. And [all this] is routine.”

He pauses to stare into the distance.

“The more you work inside the coal mine, the more you start hating it.”

He seems to imply that abuse is a form of escape.

The Red Cat and the mutkuli children

Central to most activity in Shahrag is a bus stop — those bringing coal from the mountains into the town or those leaving the town all tend to make a stopover at the adda for tea and refreshments.

We are seated at a restaurant in the adda. Around us are dozens of trucks, big and small. Some have already made the trip to the mines while others are about to embark on the journey. Amidst the bustle, we are waiting for a man known as Sira Pishi or ‘Red Cat’.

Sira Pishi is actually a 56-year-old man who is a notorious child abuser in the area. In the adda, he is known as Red Cat because he is red-skinned and has a red beard and moustache. He emerges out of a corner, wearing a black chador, a red Afghani cap and a beige coat. He greets us and then says nothing. I put my cup of tea in front of him which he refuses. Instead, he retrieves a few almonds from his kameez pocket, breaks their shells one by one with a stone, and starts munching on them.

“Do you think I am a lunatic that I will speak to a man holding a pen and notebook?”

Sira Pishi kept on eating his almonds as he waited for me to put the pen and notebook back into my bag. Eventually, like Saqib, he too confesses to having sexually abused children.

“Sometimes children come themselves,” claims Sira Pishi. “If not, then I can smell which children can be lured [into having sex.]”

Although children, by and large, get some kind of work at the adda, but when they don’t, sex work is always available as their fallback option.

His line catches me off guard. There are scores of children at the adda. As we find out later, most are aged between seven and 18 years. How many of them are vulnerable?

If Sira Pishi is to be believed, almost all these children have been sexually abused by someone or the other. One of his victims is nine-year-old Zulfiqar, who works as a mutkuli separating clay, sand and stone from the coal. He has been working since he was six years.

“This [sexual abuse] is nothing new,” Zulfiqar waves the question of abuse away. “Because all that we want is money. Our parents send us here to earn money, no matter what it costs.”

Zulfiqar has four brothers and one sister. His father is unable to work in his old age.

And he ended up at the adda because his mother wanted him to start earning a wage as soon as possible.

“My mother once saw a neighbour’s children going out to work,” describes the nine-year-old. “She saw that these kids would hand their mother money for whatever work they could find at the adda. And so she also started sending me to work.”

Zulfiqar’s main job is to help load trucks — everyday, he carries at least 60 kg of coal on his little shoulders.

“I do so all on my own. Sometimes, I load four trucks along with other children,” he claims, while wrapping himself up with a chador to save himself from the cold.

“There are four children required for each and every truck. Against it, we are paid 400 rupees per day.”

But such jobs require the boys to mingle with the men. In most cases, they are supposed to work with mature men. This often means that they give up their agency over their body as the men tend to inappropriately touch them and spank them. This is the least of it; the more extreme form is rape.

“I want to become a truck driver,” shares Zulfiqar, “not more than that.”

More probing into the whys of this dream reveals an uglier reality: truck drivers tend to travel with a young sidekick who they can molest and abuse at will. Twelve-year-old Faqir*, for example. All day long, he sits in the driver’s seat of a truck and is only used as a sexual partner by the men. He gets 400 rupees per day as compensation.

Although children, by and large, get some kind of work at the adda, but when they don’t, sex work is always available as their fallback option. Sira Pishi claims there are children who come to him themselves because they know he will pay. Interviews with about 20 of these boys also suggest that due to the fear of returning home empty-handed, they agree to get raped. In some cases, children are shown greener pastures or given the promise of a gift. ‘Red Cat’ claims he regularly ‘used’ a boy in exchange for a cell phone. Other incentives for these boys include drugs.

Background interviews with Shahrag’s children suggest that their parents, in most cases, are aware of their children’s sexual exploitation. But they turn a deaf ear to any complaints on the basis that these children are earning money. And they desperately need this money to make ends meet. This is why Shahrag’s children have “friendships” with people as old as their parents.

Meanwhile, Sira Pishi tells us he accosts children standing near trucks. One boy is his favourite; he invites him over often during the afternoon. Intercourse takes place in the confines of Sira Pishi’s home where the boy can be made “to feel special.”

Mine to mine

Legend has it that 12-year-old Nasir was “attractive and handsome, as most Afghan boys are.” His family had fled from Afghanistan and sought refuge in Pakistan. To make ends meet, Nasir would sell everyday items to coal miners. According to some accounts, coal miners would try to sodomise him. He would refuse sexual favours but often had to go back to the same men to financially support his family.

Nasir’s worst nightmare came to pass one day.

He went to one of the mines on his own but on his way back, he was kidnapped, allegedly by two Afghan coal miners. After brutally raping him, they killed him out of fear of reprisals and the police. They buried him in a nearby mine so that the police and family members could not track him down. Before anyone could find his grave, the culprits had already fled to Kandahar, Afghanistan, and they could not be arrested.

The story is used by some locals to claim that most of the sexual abuse is happening in and around the mines and not in Shahrag town proper. Others explain this is just the tip of the iceberg.

Situated next to Harnai Road in Shahrag town is the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation (PMDC) office. On its website, the PMDC claims to have leased over 6,551 acres of land in Shahrag. Over a cup of black tea, young office assistant Shah Abbas Shah claims the department owns between 300 to 400 coals mines in the town but only just over 500 of workers are registered with them.

Although Shah tells Eos that they monitor safety measures in the mines on a daily basis, as well as look after the protection of children working at the coal mines, the reality in the mines is obviously different. One measure taken by the government is that it runs a school for coal miners’ children. Although it is a high school, it wears the look of a primary school in a dilapidated state. The building’s walls are cracked. It neither has water nor a bathroom (either for children or the teachers). Yet, it is a ray of hope for children — in large part due to the efforts of Islamiat teacher Hafiz Basheer.

Basheer wears a black waistcoat over white clothes and a white turban. Among his colleagues, he is known as a “principled” teacher. He goes to the coal mines and asks the parents to send the children to school, instead of sending them to work. Sometimes, the parents relent; at other times, he is shooed away.

“More than anything else,” says Basheer, “the sole purpose of his asking children of coal miners to come to the school is to protect them from social evils.” He acknowledges the fact that these children are routinely sexually exploited. This is what always perturbs him, too.

Shahrag is among the places in Balochistan where children seem to have been desensitised to the intimacy associated with sex. Intercourse seems to be something to profit off of or a source of employment to forget some other worry. And among the children, sexual exploitation has been normalised to the extent that boys themselves show the same desires of lust and rape. This is even before they have turned 16.

“When they first get admission here,” relates Basheer, “they arrive not knowing anything. They know nothing about the outside world or what is considered civilised. It is somewhat like living in the Stone Ages. Through education, we are trying to get them to understand right from wrong. We are trying to teach them their rights.”

The Government of Pakistan has also set up schools in Shahrag for both boys and girls. Other than these schools, there are also madressahs in the town. Having interviewed some parents about why they send their children to a madressah instead of a school, the near-unanimous response was that only religious education could help their children to heaven on the Day of Judgement. This is the foremost reason that their children seek education in madressahs, not in schools.

Basheer himself, despite being an Islamiat teacher, has been unable to convince parents to send their children to school instead. One major reason why parents are reluctant is the case of a student from Dir named Abid Siddique.

Siddique was a position holder in his school till 2008 and completed matriculation from there. Although his teachers had big dreams and expectations of him, he is now back at the same coal mine, in the Al-Gilani mountains, where he used to work as a child.

Between the lines, the teacher alludes to the psychological damage that has been dealt to boys in Shahrag. Those raised on abuse will abuse someone else, just as they were abused when they were children. There is ample research that suggests that child abuse will repeat itself from generation to generation. This cycle of abuse gravely impacts those who have been at the receiving end of prolonged abuse because, once grown up, they are likely to become the abusers and prey on children.

But there is no psychological or law-enforcement help at hand in Shahrag. In fact, Quetta-based Chief Inspector of Mines Engineer Iftikhar Ahmad Khan tells Eos that, “there are no children working at the coal mines in Shahrag.”

Without acknowledging that a crisis exists, how can there be any remedy?

Sexual abuse of boys and young men is not just a phenomenon particular to Shahrag. Sahil, an Islamabad-based NGO that works with child victims of abuse, notes in its 2018 report Cruel Numbers that as many as 3,445 children — 2,077 girls and 1,368 boys — were sexually abused in Pakistan in 2017. Balochistan reported only 139 cases of sexual abuse. These incidents were all reported in the press but the number of unreported cases might well be higher.

The report makes the claim that among reported cases, 467 cases were reported under rape, 366 under sodomy, 158 under gang rape, 180 under gang sodomy and 206 under attempted child sexual abuse. It also describes that 29 boys and 36 girls were murdered after being made victims of sexual abuse. Around 961 victims fell in the age bracket of 11 to 15 years while 640 cases of sexual abuse surfaced where the survivors were aged between six and 10 years. In the 16 to 18 age bracket, 351 cases were formally reported.

Perhaps what sets Shahrag apart is the normalisation of child abuse. Consider government records, for example. While the mines department has recorded the number of adult miners working in Shahrag, the figure is under-reported. These estimates have, in fact, not recorded the number of children working in the mines or those working as house help etc.

On the other hand, the law in Pakistan does provide some safeguards for children. The Pakistan Penal Code, for example, was amended back in April 2017 to include stipulations against crimes aimed at children. Section 292-A criminalises any exposure of children to seduction. Similarly, Section 328-A describes the offence of cruelty to a child and its punishment. Sections 377-A and 377-B are explicitly about the offence of child sexual abuse and its punishment.

The problem comes at the implemen­tation end.

Desolation and desperation are accepted in Shahrag as justifications for the practices of child labour and child abuse. The government neither keeps a record of children working at the mines nor as support staff. And any notion of child protection seems out of place because of the prevalence of the practice.

“Sometimes, as teachers, we also become hopeless,” laments Hafiz Basheer. “I thought Abid Siddique would be a role model for other children of coal miners and he would be an officer somewhere in a government sector. Contrary to expectations, he has started working again as a coal miner. This is why children of coal miners always give me his example when I request them to come to study in the school.”

Adhi Gawahi | Hum TV, Wed-Thurs 8.00pm

Saima Akram Chaudhry’s screenplay may have dragged a wee bit and Fahim Burney’s direction might have had a few flaws (people who shoot themselves in the head do not look as pretty as Hamdan Mustafa did with a red smudge on his temple), but the serial concluded on a strong note. Never before has the message of harassment of women resonated so crystal clear.

In the last episode one of the characters, an NGO worker called Mrs Rehmani, points out to the protagonist Salwa (Sohai Ali Abro) that only a few women know that on January 29, 2011, the Government of Pakistan had amended Article 509 of the constitution, making harassment of women a crime. Abro, by the way, carried off the role of the victim of such harrassment effortlessly. Meanwhile, Azfar Rehman as the villianous Hamdan Mustafa sizzled in his sequences with Ali Josh, the male lead, who yet again proved that he is a promising talent.

What to watch out for

Boriyat Busters | Geo TV, Friday 6.30pm

What could be better for Ahsan Khan than hosting an exciting game show for kids, to show his versatility as well as do some repair to his image after his brilliant performance as the much-hated child molester in Udari. With the dearth of local content on TV for kids, Boriyat Busters comes a breath of fresh of air as the first season focuses on kids from Karachi.

The show kicks off with a colourful, larger-than-life set, animation, exciting prizes and lots of energy. There are shades of Legends of the Hidden Temple and Takeshi’s Castle fused together with Khan’s own desi touch. Appearances by Mawra Hocane, Humayun Saeed, Shoaib Malik, Younus Khan, Sajal Ali and Ayesha Omar promise to add glitz to the show. — Fouzia Nasir Ahmad

https://www.dawn.com/news/1090050,2/28/14 7:06,Choosing to remain silent on abortion,"ABORTION is a controversial issue, and has always been. Usually women, who bear the brunt of pregnancy and childbirth, have the least say in the decision making process but do want at least to have a choice in the matter.

The Population Council of Pakistan (PCP) data shows that more than 50 per cent of married women do not want a second child. Between 1990-91 and 2006-07, the proportion of women who wanted to limit their family size increased from 40 per cent to 52 per cent, and those in urban areas preferred smaller families.

But Pakistan’s legal system does not give women the control over what is such an important decision. The Section 338 of the PPC says, before the foetus organs are formed, the offence is penalised by imprisonment for 3–10 years. After organs are formed, compensation (diyat) is imposed. Imprisonment may also be imposed.

Abortion is only permissible for saving the life of the mother or providing her ‘necessary treatment’ (until the organs of the child have formed, following which only the life exception applies).

Whether it is a pre-marital teenage pregnancy, with the young girl at the mercy of social stigma, or it is a rape survivor who has been unfortunately impregnated – the choice to lose the foetus during the early weeks is not allowed, unless situation is dire. In many cases as a result girls have even taken the last resort as was the case of one 16-year-old Marium in 2001, who had a choice between giving birth to a baby and face ostracism, or to kill herself. She chose the latter.

But while the law does not allow abortions so easily, during a study the PCP discovered that about 890,000 abortions are taking place nationally. These are only the reported cases. More than half are being performed by quacks. The study shows that 696,000 women with post-abortion complications visit health facilities annually for post abortion care.

On the other hand the Millennium Development Goal 5 calls for a 75 per cent reduction in maternal mortality and universal access to reproductive health by 2015. But in Pakistan, this MDG along with several others, seem to remain as unresolved as ever.

Another study in January 2012 showed that proportion of total abortions carried out by untrained personnel had risen from 44 per cent to 49 per cent between 1995 and 2008. This paradoxical link between illegalisation and an increase in abortions is explained by the fact that those countries that have restrictive abortion laws tend to invest little in family planning and reproductive health measures. This results in higher unwanted pregnancies and resultantly more surreptitious abortions.

The 2012 overall rate of women treated for abortion-related health complications in both the private and public sectors is only 15 in 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 49. The lowest rate is in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and not because of contraception, but because of forced pregnancy terms. Also with the increase in population, the health sector is overburdened and treatment rate decreased from 7 to 6 per 1,000 women of reproductive age.

Those working within reproductive health sectors have been shouting themselves hoarse about giving more leeway to the woman who must make a decision about whether she can bear the child or not. This is an important decision.

However, moral values established in Pakistan’s patriarchal system have led the general population to believe that if abortions are allowed, there will tend to be more irresponsible pregnancies. This is completely untrue.

First of all the majority of women seeking such services are married, above 30 years and are usually uneducated and residents of rural areas with five children or more.

Dr Anila Warsi, who is a reproductive health expert, says the entire problem lies in the lack of family planning. “Because of this, there are unwanted pregnancies and dangerous terminations, which is acting as a burden on the public health system,” she says. “But where campaigning is concerned, the future seems bleak.

“People must understand the basic problem is not abortion, although I myself do not condone irresponsible pregnancies. But if they are so scared of even sex education how can they begin to think of abortion as a choice?”","['Xari Jalil', 'Hakim Abdul Bari', 'A Sheikh', 'Syeda Sara Batool', 'Haroon Rooha', 'Images Staff', 'Khurram Husain', 'F.S.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1578016,9/5/20 7:05,Supreme Court sees no honour in honour killings,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Friday observed that the killing of women in the name of honour had never been an honourable practice, saying such murders should not be categorised as honour killings.

“It will help deter such killings if the term ‘Ghairat’ is not used to describe them,” observed Justice Qazi Faez Isa in a judgement he authored while hearing a jail petition.

A two-judge bench headed by Justice Isa had taken up the jail appeal of Mohammad Abbas against the Sept 8, 2015 verdict of the Lahore High Court in the murder case of his wife, Saima Bibi.

Justice Isa regretted that not enough was being done to discourage crimes against women as extremism and violence have permeated through Pakistani society and it has been brutalised.

Justice Isa says not enough is being done to discourage crime against women

Mohammad Abbas was facing the allegation of killing his wife over suspected infidelity. Saima Bibi was the sister of Mohammad Asghar, the complainant who reported to police that his sister was killed by her husband. The crime was stated to have been committed at 1am on May 17, 2009 and an FIR was registered at the Baraghar police station, Nankana Sahib district.

Mohammad Abbas was tried by the sessions judge of Nankana Sahib who convicted and awarded death sentence to the accused for qatl-i-amd (murder) of his wife. He was also directed to pay compensation of Rs50,000 to the legal heirs of the deceased and in default of the payment he would face six-month simple imprisonment.

The high court, however, reduced the sentence of death to imprisonment for life because the accused had fired only once at the deceased.

The Supreme Court, however, dismissed the jail appeal on the grounds that there was no reason justifying the grant of leave as the trial court determined that the petitioner killed his wife while the high court upheld the conviction though reduced the sentence to life imprisonment.

Referring to honour killing, Justice Isa explained that it was inaccurate to translate Urdu word ‘Ghairat’ into English as ‘honour’, adding that the Urdu word did not have an exact English equivalent.

A more accurate translation of the trait of ‘Ghairat’ would be ‘arrogance’ and the one with such a trait is an ‘arrogant’ person.

Pakistan has one of the highest, if not the highest per capita honour killings in the world and predominantly the victims are women, Justice Isa regretted, adding that by stating that murder was committed on the pretext of ghairat (honour) the murderer hopes to provide some justification for the crime.

It may also elevate the murderer’s social status with those not familiar with what Almighty Allah commands in the Holy Quran, Justice Isa observed.

This is unfortunate, more so because there is no honour in such killings, Justice Isa observed, adding that the parliament was rightly concerned with the prevalence of such killings and enacted legislation to dissuade, if not stop, such crimes.

It did so by ensuring that offenders do not avail of the benefit of section 302(c) PPC, for which the maximum punishment is twenty-five years imprisonment but which does not prescribe a minimum punishment, Justice Isa recalled.

The family of the deceased, identified as Mubashir, alleges that he was killed for 'honour' by Muneer, who suspected his wife to have been in a relationship with the deceased man.

On the complaint of the deceased man's brother, police have registered a murder case against four men, including Muneer, who are suspected to have fled after killing the man and hanging his body to a tree in Thalla Kalan, on the outskirts of Rawalpindi, on Thursday.

The investigating officer, Sub-Inspector Ahmed Nawaz, told DawnNews that Mubashir was a herder. He said whether the man was poisoned or strangled to death could only be confirmed after reports of his postmortem examination are received. He said police are conducting raids to arrest the suspects.

However, because the man's body was found hanging from a tree, police are also investigating the angle of suicide, he said.

The complaint filed in Chontra Police Station by Mubashir's brother names four suspects.

The brother, Mohammad Iqrar, told police that Muneer had suspected that his wife had relations with Mubashir and he, therefore, murdered him without any investigation or proof.

Hundreds of women and some men are murdered every year in Pakistan, often by their own relatives, for going against their families' wishes in matters of love and marriage.

According to Saima Munir, who works for the Aurat Foundation, there has been a 70 per cent increase in honour killings in the past year.","['Tahir Naseer', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1502597,8/30/19 16:30,Punjab govt to negotiate with Sikh community over alleged forced conversion of 19-year-old girl,"A high-level committee, headed by Punjab Law Minister Raja Basharat, has been constituted by the provincial government in order to negotiate with a 30-member committee formed by Pakistan's Sikh community in relation to a case pertaining to the alleged forced conversion of a Sikh girl, it emerged on Friday.

According to a memorandum sent to inspector general of police (IGP) Punjab by the district police officer (DPO) of Nankana Sahib, a First Information Report (FIR) was filed in the Nankana police station on August 28 against six people who were accused of abducting and forcefully converting 19-year-old Sikh girl Jagjit Kaur.

The police subsequently traced the suspects to Lahore and detained one of them. Three of the suspects obtained pre-arrest bail while two others are at large, the memorandum said.

The police were subsequently contacted by Sheikh Sultan, Kaur's advocate, who told them she had embraced Islam, was given the name Ayesha, and then contracted marriage with Mohammad Hassan — one of the main suspects — of her own free will.

Sultan further said that he had filed a writ petition in the Lahore High Court on behalf of Kaur against her family and local police, accusing them of ""illegal harassment"".

The girl also submitted a written statement in the court, stating that she had converted to Islam and married Hassan of her own free will. She also accused her family of ""wanting to kill her"". She is currently housed in Darul Aman, Lahore, as per the orders of an additional sessions judge.

The DPO, in his memorandum, attached the ""relevant documentary and video proof of the nikah and the girl's conversion to Islam"". Copies of the documents from the National Database and Registration Authority, which show that Kaur is 19 years of age, and the nikahnama were also attached.

Following the girl's statements in court, the Sikh community has demanded that the police bring her back to her parents' house irrespective of the conversion being forced or consensual.

The DPO informed the IGP that the Sikh community was ""agitating against the incident and videos of family of the girl [were] also viral on social media and international media"".

""It is requested that concerned quarters may kindly be taken on board so that Sikh community could be engaged and pacified timely as the community has announced to protest if their demand is not honoured,"" he wrote.

""It is pertinent to mention here that in the backdrop of Indo-Pak tension vis-a-vis [occupied] Kashmir, any such protest could damage image of the country internationally,"" he added.","['Asif Chaudhry', 'Iftikhar Husain', 'Subodh Dhir', 'Arif Khan', 'Jamil Soomro', 'New York City', 'Hamed', 'Tau Iqbal', 'Dr. Kartikay Pandey', 'Sunny']","A high-level committee, headed by Punjab Law Minister Raja Basharat, has been constituted by the provincial government in order to negotiate with a 30-member committee formed by Pakistan's Sikh community in relation to a case pertaining to the alleged forced conversion of a Sikh girl, it emerged on Friday.

The DPO informed the IGP that the Sikh community was ""agitating against the incident and videos of family of the girl [were] also viral on social media and international media"".
""It is requested that concerned quarters may kindly be taken on board so that Sikh community could be engaged and pacified timely as the community has announced to protest if their demand is not honoured,"" he wrote.","['court', 'lahore', 'sikh', 'girl', 'conversion', 'punjab', 'community', 'dpo', 'govt', 'forced', '19yearold', 'alleged', 'suspects', 'memorandum', 'islam', 'family', 'negotiate']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189f00b83e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0d52ba8a43.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2017/07/596c5cdfdfcdf.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/07/596c5cdfdfcdf.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/03/5c96791e1a73e.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/03/5c96791e1a73e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21824a8678.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189916390d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2019/08/5d69023655a86.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0ec56aad75.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd22283a73d3.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18a3ece187.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/03/5c9ffe513532b.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/08/5d69023655a86.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f94d8916a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/03/5c9ffe513532b.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f4142e469.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24c3aad888.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24e90196c5.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2019/08/5d69023655a86.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Girl says she married converted and married willingly; parents want her returned regardless.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1502597', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Punjab govt to negotiate with Sikh community over alleged forced conversion of 19-year-old girl', 'description': 'Girl says she married converted and married willingly; parents want her returned regardless.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2019/08/5d69023655a86.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1502597', 'title': 'Punjab govt to negotiate with Sikh community over alleged forced conversion of 19-year-old girl', 'description': 'Girl says she married converted and married willingly; parents want her returned regardless.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2019/08/5d69023655a86.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2019-08-30 16:30:49', 'modified_time': '2019-08-30 16:35:11', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/1370/asif-chaudhry'}, 'author': 'Asif Chaudhry'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1098452,4/8/14 7:24,"1,000 minority girls forced in marriage every year: report","WASHINGTON: An estimated one thousand Christian and Hindu women are forced to convert and marry Muslim men in Pakistan every year, says a report released on Monday.

According to a report by the Movement for Solidarity and Peace in Pakistan, up to 700 of these women are Christian and 300 are Hindu.

“The true scale of the problem is likely to be much greater, as a number of cases are never reported or do not progress through the law-enforcement and legal systems,” the authors claim.

The MSP also issued an appeal for action along with this investigative report detailing forced marriages and conversions of Christian girls and women in Pakistan.

The Christian community in Pakistan is over two million in size, accounts for 42 per cent of Pakistan's minority population, and is mostly resident in Punjab.

MSP’s investigations find that cases of forced marriages/conversions follow a distinctive pattern: Christian girls — usually between the ages of 12 and 25 — are abducted, converted to Islam, and married to the abductor or third party.

The victim's family usually files a First Information Report for abduction or rape with the local police station. The abductor, on behalf of the victim girl, files a counter FIR, accusing the Christian family of harassing the willfully converted and married girl, and for conspiring to convert the girl back to Christianity.

Upon production in the courts or before the magistrate, the victim girl is asked to testify whether she converted and married of her own free will or if she was abducted.

In most cases, the girl remains in custody of the abductor while judicial proceedings are carried out.

Upon the girl's pronouncement that she willfully converted and consented to the marriage, the case is settled without relief for the family. Once in the custody of the abductor, the victim girl may be subjected to sexual violence, rape, forced prostitution, human trafficking and sale, or other domestic abuse.

These patterns of violence and miscarriages of justice are explored in the report through an examination of 10 illustrative cases.

The report also describes the historical and social context of the problem, and the particular grievances of Pakistan's Christian community in relation to the existing legal, political, and procedural guarantees for the protection of human rights of Pakistan's religious minorities. The report also highlights the patterns of violence through which the law and social attitudes become complicit in providing immunity for perpetrators, and the complex nature of associated crimes that make it difficult to categorise this crime as specific to religious identity. The report concludes with detailed recommendations at various levels — national, provincial, and local — for key stakeholders.

MSP is mobilising an inclusive coalition to raise awareness on this issue. MSP will host outreach events in the coming weeks in Pakistan (in collaboration with the National Commission of Justice and Peace in Pakistan) and around the world.","['Anwar Iqbal', 'Shamsher Singh Dhilliion', 'Abdul Manan', 'Rashid Sultan', 'Rakesh Pustode', 'Younis Abid', 'Indian', 'M K Sufi', 'Smq Zaman', 'Hassan Parvez']","WASHINGTON: An estimated one thousand Christian and Hindu women are forced to convert and marry Muslim men in Pakistan every year, says a report released on Monday.

https://www.dawn.com/news/622241/indian-court-urges-honour-killing-crackdown,4/19/11 21:03,Indian court urges ‘honour killing’ crackdown,"NEW DELHI, April 19: India’s Supreme Court on Tuesday told state governments to “ruthlessly” stamp out so-called honour killings and warned that officials who fail to deal with the practice would be prosecuted.

India has seen a recent upsurge in such crimes, which mainly involve young couples who marry outside their caste and are murdered by relatives to protect what they see as the family’s reputation and pride.

The court on Tuesday lashed out at councils of village elders, known locally as khap panchayats, as “kangaroo courts,” saying they encouraged honour killings.

“There is nothing honourable in honour killing or other atrocities and, in fact, it is nothing but barbaric and shameful murder,” judges Markandeya Katju and Gyan Sudha Mishra said in the judgment.

“We have heard of khap panchayats which often decree or encourage honour killings or other atrocities in an institutionalised way on boys and girls of different castes and religions, who wish to get married or have been married, or interfere with the personal lives of people,” they said.

“We are of the opinion that this is wholly illegal and has to be ruthlessly stamped out.”

There are no official figures on honour killings, though an independent study last year suggested that as many as 900 were being committed every year in the northern states of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.

Many go unreported, with police and local politicians turning a blind eye to what some see as an acceptable form of traditional justice.

https://www.dawn.com/news/726517,6/14/12 11:32,China confirms forced abortion case after uproar,"Chinese Flag. - File Photo

BEIJING: Chinese authorities confirmed Thursday that a woman was forced to abort seven months into her pregnancy; several days after her plight came to light when images of her baby's corpse were posted online.

Rights groups have blamed authorities in north China's Shaanxi province for forcing Feng Jianmei to abort her pregnancy because she failed to pay a hefty fine for exceeding China's strict “one-child” population control policy.

The Shaanxi provincial government said in a statement that a preliminary probe had confirmed the case was “basically true”, and the investigators have recommended action be taken against the perpetrators.

“This is a serious violation of the National Population and Family Planning Commission's policies, jeopardizes the population control work and has caused uneasiness in society,” the provincial government said on its website.

Chinese web users have reacted in anger to the abortion, with one comparing it to acts perpetrated by “Japanese devils and Nazis”, after photos online showed Feng lying on a hospital bed next to the blood-smeared body of her baby.

A relative told AFP on Wednesday that Feng and her husband had opposed the termination.

An official at the national family planning commission who declined to be named said earlier that the commission viewed the matter as “serious and important” and that the probe was being handled at the “top level”.

China has implemented its draconian family planning policy since the late 1970s.

Under the policy, urban families are generally allowed to have one child, while rural families can give birth to two children if the first is a girl.

They have to pay a fine if they contravene the rules.

Rights groups say that as a result of the policy, thousands of women have been forced by authorities to terminate their pregnancies.

Official statistics show that since the start of the policy, the number of abortions peaked in 1983, with a total of 14.37 million terminations that year.

The US on Monday expressed opposition to China's one-child policy after activists reported that a five-month-pregnant woman faces an imminent forced abortion in a separate case.

“We make no secret that the United States strongly oppose all aspects of China's coercive birth limitation policies, including forced abortion and sterilization, and we always raise these issues with the Chinese government,” State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said.","['Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

The US on Monday expressed opposition to China's one-child policy after activists reported that a five-month-pregnant woman faces an imminent forced abortion in a separate case.","['uproar', 'population', 'feng', 'family', 'case', 'confirms', 'planning', 'chinas', 'forced', 'authorities', 'abortion', 'chinese', 'china', 'policy']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd329902b790.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2efebbe9a2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/2012/06/china-670-3501.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'http://i.dawn.com/2012/06/china-116.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg'}",TRUE,http://i.dawn.com/2012/06/china-116.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Abortions compared to acts perpetrated by “Japanese devils and Nazis.”', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/2012/06/14/china-confirms-forced-abortion-case-after-uproar/', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'China confirms forced abortion case after uproar', 'description': 'Abortions compared to acts perpetrated by “Japanese devils and Nazis.”', 'image': 'http://i.dawn.com/2012/06/china-670-3501.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/2012/06/14/china-confirms-forced-abortion-case-after-uproar/', 'title': 'China confirms forced abortion case after uproar', 'description': 'Abortions compared to acts perpetrated by “Japanese devils and Nazis.”', 'image': 'http://i.dawn.com/2012/06/china-670-3501.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2012-06-14 11:32:00', 'modified_time': '2012-06-14 11:32:00', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/119/afp'}, 'author': 'AFP'})",[],dawn

https://www.dawn.com/news/1291344,10/21/16 6:40,PTV official convicted in sexual harassment case,"ISLAMABAD: The federal ombudsperson against harassment of women at workplace on Thursday convicted the director news Pakistan Television (PTV) in a sexual harassment case filed by six women newscasters of the state-run television.

The ombudsperson, retired Justice Yasmin Abbasi, imposed a Rs250,000 fine on Athar Farooq Bhuttar, the director news PTV, and censured him in the sexual harassment complaint.

The newscasters in the complaint had accused Mr Bhuttar of sexual harassment, humiliation and applying insulting behaviour against them as well other anchorpersons.

On June 8, the anchorpersons had written a letter to the federal minister for information and broadcasting stating: “Several respectable female news anchors were sexually harassed, humiliated and pressured by the sitting director news.”

According to the letter, on the complaints of the anchorpersons, a couple of years ago the then MD PTV, Mohammad Malik, had removed Mr Bhuttar from the post. However, he was reinstated after a few months.

It said male anchors also had protested against the director news for causing mental harassment to them. “The DN used warnings and issued explanation letters to trap anchors,” it alleged. Following the letter, the information ministry constituted a team, comprising senior PTV officials, to probe the matter. While the matter was pending with the inquiry team, the anchorpersons filed a complaint with the ombudsperson.

Mr Bhuttar, on the other hand, denied the allegations and claimed before the court that he was not guilty. Almost all the editorial staff of the newsroom supported Mr Bhuttar in the case.

In an application, 80 reporters, producers, sub-editors, translators and news editors – accounting for most of the editorial staff – claimed that “Mr Buttar is highly professional and dedicated worker who is serving the department for the last 25 years. Not a single female co-worker or subordinate made such allegations against him during that period.”

It added: “The only issue which time and again caused tension in the newsroom is the late arrival, unavailability, wrong pronunciation and attitude of the news anchors. Those who perform their duties have never found any problem with [Mr Buttar].”

When contacted, Mr Bhuttar told Dawn that he would file an appeal against the ombudsperson’s order with the president of Pakistan.

He said the ombudsperson awarded him a minor punishment and only censured him.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1288539/polish-lawmakers-overwhelmingly-reject-total-ban-on-abortion,10/7/16 6:36,Polish lawmakers overwhelmingly reject total ban on abortion,"WARSAW: Women take part in a nationwide demonstration on Monday to protest against a legislative proposal for a total ban of abortion.—AFP

WARSAW: Polish lawmakers voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to reject a proposal by an anti-abortion group that would have imposed a total ban on abortion, caving in to massive outrage by women who have been dressing in black and waging street protests across the country.

The mostly Catholic nation already has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, with abortion only allowed in rare cases — rape or incest, when the mother’s life is in danger or the foetus is badly damaged.

The proposal for further tightening the law came from a citizens’ initiative that gathered some 450,000 signatures in this nation of 38 million. It was supported by the Roman Catholic church.

But it was highly unpopular with most Poles, with people baulking at the idea that a teenage rape victim should be forced to have her baby, or that a woman whose health was badly compromised would be forced to carry to term. The proposal had also called for prison terms of up to five years for women who sought abortions.

With abortion already illegal in most cases, many women said what frightened them the most in the proposal was that it could have led doctors to be afraid to perform prenatal tests or that women who suffered miscarriages could start to fall under criminal suspicion.

Initially many members of the conservative ruling party, Law and Justice, supported the proposal. Two weeks ago a majority of lawmakers voted to consider it, sending it to a commission for further study. But the party backed away from it under massive social pressure, and lawmakers voted against it 352-58.

The outcome of the vote is a blow to the ruling party, which has a core of ultra-conservative Catholic voters that wanted to see further restrictions to the abortion law. But the party also came to power thanks to centrist voters and young people who were attracted by the party’s welfare programme, with its promises to help the poor and even out the vast economic differences of the post-communist era.

Many in that latter group have been taking to the streets in recent days, and opinion polls show that the party’s support has now fallen to its lowest point since it won elections a year ago. Now the party finds itself on the defensive after angering groups on all sides — women, its traditional opposition, moderates among its own electorate and religious conservatives.

Mariusz Dzierzawski, from the Stop Abortion committee, accused the ruling party leadership of “hypocrisy” for turning its back on his group’s proposal. Prime Minister Beata Szydlo vowed that her government will now take other steps to protect human life. She announced a new plan to earmark more money from the budget for families with disabled children and said it would begin an information campaign that would “promote the protection of life”.

Two weeks ago a majority of lawmakers voted to consider it, sending it to a commission for further study.
But the party backed away from it under massive social pressure, and lawmakers voted against it 352-58.
The outcome of the vote is a blow to the ruling party, which has a core of ultra-conservative Catholic voters that wanted to see further restrictions to the abortion law.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1517889,11/21/19 7:02,"Only officials of ASP rank and above can investigate child sexual abuse cases, IHC rules","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has set guidelines for the investigation of child sexual abuse cases and made it mandatory for such offences to be investigated by police officers of assistant superintendent of police (ASP) rank and above.

While dismissing a petition seeking bail in a child sexual abuse case on Wednesday, IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah criticised the police investigation and directed for the standards of such investigations to be improved.

The petitioner, Mohammad Zeeshan, had sought post-arrest bail in a case registered on Aug 20 under sections 377 and 511 of the Pakistan Penal Code with the Bhara Kahu police.

According to the details of the case, the child of the complainant was allegedly sexually abused by the petitioner at a seminary. The counsel for the petitioner claimed that he was involved in the case with mala fide intentions and the complainant had ulterior motives.

Court sets guidelines after finding that police did not probe child abuse properly

The charge sheet the police submitted to the trial court said that charges were framed against the petitioner but the investigation did not find incriminating material despite the petitioner being on physical remand.

The police said no private witnesses of the occurrence were associated during the proceedings, and that the allegations in the FIR were false, fictitious and concocted. The petitioner was incarcerated for nearly three months, did not have a previous criminal record or conviction and was deemed innocent of the alleged offences.

State counsel appeared in court along with Investigating Officer Tanveer Hussain on Wednesday. Mr Hussain was asked about the investigation he conducted and the role of the administrator of the seminary, whose protection the victim had been under.

Mr Hussain told the court his investigation was limited to recording the complainant’s statements.

The court observed that the investigating officer could not produce any material to show that the complaint, which is of a serious nature and involves a child victim of sexual abuse, has been investigated properly.

The court said that it appeared the investigating officer had proceeded with the case in a casual manner without investigating it.

The superintendent of police (investigations) was directed to appear in court on Nov 19 and did not comply with the directions, after which the matter was fixed for the appearance of the inspector general of police Islamabad.

Deputy Inspector General of Police (Operations) Waqaruddin Syed appeared in court on Wednesday, when the petition was taken up. He acknowledged that the case was not investigated properly and said the investigation has been transferred to another officer.

He added that the investigation conducted by the new officer has prima facie revealed the role of the seminar’s administrator, who has been arrested.

The court order stated that in view of the number of reported incidents of child sexual abuse in the recent past, the executive authorities are expected to exercise extraordinary case whenever a complaint of this nature is received.

The order said the manner in which the case was dealt with showed obvious apathy on the part of the executive public functionaries and an attitude of indifference towards a serious malaise prevalent in society.

Expressing displeasure regarding the investigation, the court noted: “Due to poor quality of investigations and lapses on part of the prosecution, persons involved in heinous criminal acts go unpunished…children require extraordinary care and protection, particularly when incidents involving sexual abuse and molestation are reported frequently.”

Justice Minallah observed: “It is the duty of the state through its executive functionaries to ensure that rights of children are not only safeguarded but persons who harm them are prosecuted in a manner that there is no likelihood of avoiding exemplary punishment.”

“Crimes against children cannot be left to be dealt with by incompetent, unwilling and unprofessional investigators,” the court order stated, adding: “Keeping in view the nature of offence of child sexual abuse and the state of affairs relating to the quality of investigations in Islamabad Capital Territory, it is directed that in a case involving alleged sexual abuse of a child, the investigations will be promptly entrusted to an official who is not lower in rank than an assistant superintendent of police.”

The order said the inspector general and chief commissioner may also consider developing a mechanism to examine people accused of sexual abuse by a medical board to assess the likelihood that they will repeat the offence if released on bail, and conduct a search regarding any criminal history.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1527519,1/11/20 7:11,"Celebrities join hands against child abuse, urge govt to implement laws","KARACHI: A number of celebrities, some in attendance while others sharing their thoughts via recorded video messages, extended their support to the campaign against child abuse at a presser organised at the press club on Friday where they called upon the government to implement all relevant laws related to children’s rights.

They also urged the government to appoint trained staff at hospitals to handle cases of child abuse, establish separate reporting desks for child abuse cases at police stations and make changes in the school curriculum to help children understand and report abuse.

The press conference was organised to launch a film campaign on child abuse by Angeline Malik, the producer and director of the venture.

“A few years ago, the numbers of child abuse cases were only a matter of stats for me until I went to Kasur and met a victim of child sexual abuse,” Malik said, explaining what motivated her to launch the campaign.

Sharing the victim’s psychological trauma, she said the girl had developed strong fears and screamed whenever a door slammed in the home or she heard her mother’s voice.

“No child should go through what she experienced. That’s why I launched this campaign so that our voices are heard,” Malik said, while appreciating the support of her colleagues and Sahil, a non-profit organisation working for child protection.

Referring to the Zainab Alert Bill passed by the National Assembly two years after the Kasur killings, she said that while that’s good news, the important thing was to see the law being implemented in letter and spirit.

Continuing on the same point, she cited Pakistan’s ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990 and said the country still lagged far behind in its implementation.

To a question, she said it’s the first film on the subject and more would follow on the same theme to create awareness and raise a collective voice against the heinous crime.

Samina Ahmed said child abuse was a grave crime and its growing incidents should be a matter of concern for everyone.

“Ideally, children should be raised in a healthy and secure environment. To me, making children understand about good and bad touch is like snatching part of their childhood [but unfortunately we need to do this as we don’t live in a perfect environment],” she observed.

On the Zainab Alert Bill, she said apparently its jurisdiction was restricted to the federal capital and the respective provincial governments needed to do their legislation on this subject.

Faraz Khan, a member of the advisory board of Muhafiz, a digital app for reporting threat/s to support groups and institutions including the law enforcement agencies, underscored the need for changing societal mindset and making institutions law-abiding bodies.

Sharing her sentiments, Bushra Ansari demanded brutal punishment for perpetrators of child abuse and said they should be subjected to the same pain, torture and injuries that they inflicted upon their victims.

“[The] death penalty is not enough for offenders of such heinous crimes as this punishment inflicts pain for a moment. Such offenders should be subjected to horrifying, brutal death so others don’t dare indulge in such inhumane acts,” she said, while asking government to direct educational institutions, including the religious ones, to install cameras at their premises.

Ansari was of the opinion that the matter of child abuse was interlinked with many social issues including growing population and there was a need to make people understand the importance of and practice family planning.

Zeba Bakhtiar said child abuse was a complicated matter and, unlike common perception that it had more to do with the lower-income households, it was prevalent in all sections of society and needed an in-depth psychological approach to understand the reasons behind it and come up with the right solutions.

Among those who had recorded their messages were Ushna Shah, Hina Bayat, Saman Ansari, Ahmed Ali Butt, Alyy Khan, Sarwat Gillani, Samiya Mumtaz, Rasikh Ismail, Salma Hasan, Suzain Fatima and Nida Yasir.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1228986,12/27/15 13:12,China officially ends one child policy: state media,"BEIJING: China officially ended its one child policy on Sunday with the signing into law of a bill allowing all married couples to have a second child as it attempts to cope with an ageing population and shrinking workforce.

The change, which was announced in October by the ruling Communist Party, takes effect from January 1, the Xinhua news agency reported.

All married couples will be allowed to have a second child but the legislation maintains limits on additional births.

The “one child policy”, instituted in the late 1970s, restricted most couples to only a single offspring and for years authorities argued that it was a key contributor to China's economic boom and had prevented 400 million births.

It has been enforced by a dedicated national commission with a system of fines for violators and often forced abortions, leading to heartrending tales of loss for would-be parents.

The policy led to sex-selective abortions or infanticide targeting girls, because of a centuries-old social preference for boys.

Rural families were already allowed two children if the first was a girl, while ethnic minorities were allowed an extra offspring, leading some to dub it a “one-and-a-half child” policy.

As a result China's population – the world's largest at 1.37 billion – is now ageing rapidly, gender imbalances are severe, and its workforce is shrinking.

These concerns led to limited reforms in 2013, including allowing couples to have two children if either of them was an only child, but relatively few have taken up the opportunity due to limited income and higher perceived opportunity costs.

Experts say that the shift to a two child policy is likely too little, too late to address China's looming population crisis and that the government is unlikely to dismantle enforcement mechanisms for reproductive control due to deeply entrenched bureaucratic interests.","['A True Fact', 'M.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1450026,12/7/18 16:29,Thousands of Myanmar women forced into marriage in China: study,"Thousands of vulnerable women and girls from northern Myanmar are being trafficked to China and forced to marry, a study said on Friday, offering a rare look at an issue that grips the conflict-hit borderlands.

China has around 33 million fewer women than men due to the decades-long one-child policy.

To plug the gap, tens of thousands of poor women from Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam are sold as brides each year, some going willingly, while others are tricked or trafficked.

In the first research of its kind, a report by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health estimated 7,500 women from war-torn Kachin and northern Shan states have fallen victim to forced marriage in China.

Based on interviews with scores of people who escaped and returned to Myanmar, and others still inside China, the study found that the majority of those trafficked were also forced to carry a child for their husband.

Women leave Myanmar because of “conflict, displacement and poverty” said report author W. Courtland Robinson, while “the male-female sex imbalance in China, especially in rural areas” means demand for a wife is high.

One woman told researchers that she was trafficked into China three times, and each time “pushed into giving birth”, said Moon Nay Li of Kachin Women's Association Thailand, who led the field research in Kachin and Shan states.

“Because of political instability, conflict and land confiscation... security for women is a big challenge,” she said.

Marriages are often arranged and brokered by the women's own families and village elders, with brides-to-be unable to refuse as they are at the bottom of the social hierarchy.

The youngest women command higher prices of up to $10,000-15,000.

Their matches in China are typically to older, sick, or disabled men in rural areas — people considered undesirable to the Han Chinese — while the women's lack of documentation plunges them into a legal limbo.

The study found that women were often “hired” to bear children for their husbands and then forced out or sold on to new husbands to recoup money.

Some women have successful marriages and the issue of consent is complex and varies case-by-case, Robinson said.

But all unions should be entered into without “threat, menace or penalty”, he added.

Often daughters “can't say no to their parents”, said Moon Nay Li, and feel compelled to go ahead with the marriage once “traffickers and agents have given money to their parents”.

Researchers called for Myanmar to end the conflict in Kachin and Shan states, which has displaced tens of thousands of women, and to train anti-trafficking officials to enforce the law and recognise the women as victims.","['Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1581429/alleged-killer-of-policeman-shot-dead-in-encounter,9/25/20 7:25,Alleged killer of policeman shot dead in ‘encounter’,"KARACHI: Police’s Coun­ter-Terrorism Department on Thursday claimed to have killed a suspect in an ‘encounter’ in Pehlwan Goth area of Gulistan-i-Jauhar who was allegedly involved in targeted killing of police officer Ghulam Mohammed Gujjar in Saddar in July. He had killed the officer after an argument.

The killed suspect, Naveed Khan alias Nomi, was a “habitual criminal and hitman” who had killed three policemen among 11 persons and committed over 200 street crimes after being released after remission from court in 2017, said CTD official Raja Umar Khattab.

Investigation into the officer’s killing was carried out and the suspect was traced early on Thursday morning in Pehlwan Goth where he was killed in the ‘encounter.’

The suspect belonged to a local criminal gang known as Muddasir chief group in Pehlwan Goth.

The deceased was born in Gulistan-i-Jauhar and had remained involved in street crimes and targeted killings. He had three wives; out of them two were alleged criminals who belonged to ‘dacoit group.’ The suspect had also allegedly gunned down his maternal aunt, Mrs Nusrat Chaudhry, who was running a “notorious dacoit gang.” He had doubts that his aunt wanted to turn him in to law enforcers, therefore he gunned her down at ASF ground.

“The killed suspect belonged to a criminal family,” claimed the CTD official. His mother had married four times whose fourth husband, Sagheer Ahmed alias Goga, also committed street crimes along with the killed suspect. He was arrested by the police in 2006 along with his brother Sohail over charges of targeted killings and robberies.

He and his brother Sohail were awarded 25 years imprisonment over murder cases in Khwaja Ajmer Nagri and Gulberg areas. He had filed an appeal before Sindh High Court in 2017 and the high court granted him remission, therefore, he was released from prison after serving 11 years.

Mr Khattab said that the killed suspect was involved in 11 targeted killings including of three policemen and five workers/supporters of Muttahida Qaumi Move­ment in different parts of the metropolis.

Regarding motive of killing assistant sub-inspector Ghulam Mohammed in Saddar on July 23, the CTD official pointed out that intelligence sources revealed that a quarrel had taken place between the martyred officer and the suspect after collision between their motorbikes.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1239719,2/15/16 16:29,Sindh Assembly approves Hindu Marriage Bill,"KARACHI: For the first time in the country's history, marriage laws for millions of Hindus living in Sindh have been codified after the Sindh Assembly approved the Hindu Marriage Bill, 2016, on Monday.

Senior PPP leader and Sindh Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs Nisar Ahmad Khuhro moved the bill in the provincial assembly which was later passed after a debate between the opposition and treasury benches.

The bride and groom cannot be less than 18 years, according to the text of the approved draft.

Married couples will be required to obtain a marriage registration certificate, while a couple can also face fines in case their marriage is not registered. The law can be applied retroactively to existing marriages.

Zoroastrians and Sikhs will also be able to register their marriages under the new law.

Hindus, despite being the second-largest religious minority group in Pakistan, with a population of 3.3 million, had no legal mechanism to register marriages.

Related: ‘Delay in Hindu marriage laws a denial of basic rights’

Unlike the Muslim majority or Christians, Hindus lacked any legal framework for protection of their marriages and are unable to provide legal proof when required.

Christians, the other main religious minority, have a British law dating back to 1870 regulating their marriages.

Without the law, Hindus say their women were easy targets for rape or forced marriage and faced problems in proving the legitimacy of their relationships before the law. Widows have been particularly disadvantaged.

Without official proof of relationships, getting government documents issued or moving forward on any other activity which involves documentation — from opening bank accounts to applying for visas — became next to impossible for any citizen.

After the 18th Amendment, the issues of religious minorities and their family matters became provincial subjects but the Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies passed resolutions allowing the federation to legislate Hindu marriage law.

A similar resolution is pending in the Punjab Assembly.

A draft bill has already been passed by the National Assembly standing committee on law and justice, while Senator Nasreen Jalil, the chairperson of the Senate standing committee on law and justice, has also convened a meeting of the committee to take up the matter.

A clause in the draft Hindu Marriage Bill, which states that a marriage will be annulled if any of the spouses converts to another religion, is being vehemently contested by both its opponents and supporters.

Clause 12(iii) says a marriage will be annulled if any of the spouses converts to another religion

The patron-in-chief of Pakistan Hindu Council, PML-N MNA Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, said the matter related to the basic human rights of the Hindus in Pakistan.

“There are fears the clause would be misused for forced conversions of married women the same way young girls are being subjected to forced conversions.”

He referred to the current practice by certain elements who kidnapped teenage girls and eventually presented them in courts along with a certificate that the girl had married after converting to Islam.

PPP parliamentarian Senator Taj Haider opposed the idea in the law, and said the clause could also discourage cross-marriages.

The US Commission on Religious Freedom said in a recent report that conditions in Pakistan had “hit an all-time low” and governments had failed to adequately protect minorities and arrest those who attack or discriminate against them.

But many see the passage of the bill as a ray of hope.

“Now after the passage of this bill in the Sindh Assembly, after 70 years, Hindus will also have a marriage certificate just like Muslims do,” said Shahnaz Sheedi, the coordinator for South Asia Partnership Pakistan, a civil rights movement.

“We hope that bill will be soon adopted at the national level,” she said. The National Assembly in Islamabad has been considering such a bill it is still in committee.","['Dawn.Com', 'Sajjad Khan', 'Ali Jee', 'Asgher Ali', 'Tanweer Khan', 'Democratic Kp', 'A Troll Nowhere', 'Awais Ali', 'An Expatriate', 'Agha Ata']","KARACHI: For the first time in the country's history, marriage laws for millions of Hindus living in Sindh have been codified after the Sindh Assembly approved the Hindu Marriage Bill, 2016, on Monday.

The bodies of the girl (15), and the boy (17), were exhumed from the Mauladad graveyard in Sherpao Colony in the presence of Azhar Ali Kalhoro, a judicial magistrate, and a team of doctors and police officials.

Civil Hospital Karachi Additional Police Surgeon Dr Qarar Ahmed Abbasi confirmed that ""there were visible signs of electric shock and torture on both bodies.""

Shah Latif Town Police Investigating Officer (IO) Ghulam Asghar Shaikh told Dawn that the girl and boy fled their homes on Aug 14 and stayed at the home of a relative in Sherpao Colony as they intended to marry of their own will. The relative, however, informed the parents of both victims, who then took them away.

After the development, a 30-35 person jirga was held, presided over by a local tribal elder identified as Sartaj, the IO said.

Following the jirga, the girl was electrocuted at around 11pm on Aug 15, while the boy was electrocuted around 3am on Aug 16, the IO added.

Police got wind of the case through an informant and subsequently filed a first information report on behalf of the state, after which four accused ─ the fathers and uncles of the victims ─ were arrested on Aug 21.

IO Shaikh said the accused, who had confessed to the crime, claimed to repent killing the children, alleging they were under the pressure of the jirga which urged them to murder the pair in order to to protect the 'honour' of their tribe.","['Imtiaz Ali', 'Mushtaq Ahmed', 'Muslim Medina', 'Syed', 'El Cid', 'Yankee Cricket Fan', 'Satyaki Datta', 'Md Rafi', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff']","The bodies of a teenage couple in Karachi feared to have been murdered by their families after they wished to contract a free-will marriage were found bearing electrocution and torture marks following a post-mortem examination on Wednesday, officials said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1471573,3/24/19 11:27,"PM orders Sindh, Punjab govts to investigate reports of teenage girls' alleged abduction, forced conversion","Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday ordered the Sindh and Punjab governments to work together to recover two teenage girls who were allegedly kidnapped, forced to convert from Hinduism to Islam before being married to Muslim men, and have reportedly been taken to Rahim Yar Khan from Ghotki.

The father and brother of the girls in videos — circulating on social media over the last two days — said that the two sisters were abducted and forced into changing their religion from Hinduism to Islam. However, a separate video of the girls has also been making rounds, in which they said that they accepted Islam of their own free will.

Minister for Information Fawad Chaudhry, via tweets on Sunday, said that Prime Minister Khan has asked the Sindh and Punjab governments to investigate reports of the two minor girls being shifted to Rahim Yar Khan from Ghotki.

The prime minister further asked that the two girls be recovered if they have indeed been moved to the city.

According to the tweet, the prime minister also directed the Sindh government to take concrete steps against such incidents [of abduction and forced conversions].

In his tweet, Chaudhry further said that Pakistan's minorities represent the white part of Pakistan's flag and that ""we love all our colours and the protection of our flag is our responsibility.""

Uproar on social media

On Saturday, after the case created uproar on social media, Chaudhry said the government had taken notice of reports of the alleged forced conversion and underage marriages of the two girls in Ghotki.

Chaudhry on Twitter said that the Human Rights Ministry had been ""asked for an inquiry"".

Lawyer and activist Jibran Nasir was among those who raised the issue on Twitter, sharing a video which he said was of the two sisters, one aged 14 and the other 16.

In the video, a cleric can be seen next to the girls and two men who they were married to. The cleric says the girls were inspired by Islam and alleges that their family is spreading ""false propaganda"" and is threatening their lives.

Nasir said the sisters were converted at the Dargah Barchundi Sharif. ""As per Dargah, girls wanted to convert to Islam since long influenced by its teachings, but first act after conversion was underage marriage,"" he said. The girls were reportedly taken to Rahim Yar Khan following their marriages.

Nasir also shared a copy of a first information report dated March 20, which was registered by the girls' family against their alleged forced conversion to Islam.

""FIR [registered] with local police for 'abducting to compel to marriage'. Age in FIR is 14 and 16,"" said Nasir. ""Under Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act, every citizen under 18 falls under definition of child and cant be married.""

""Police has tried to dismiss the matter by citing a video of the two sisters in which they claim they will fully converted (sic) to Islam,"" Nasir said.

Most Hindu families in Pakistan live in Sindh and according to media reports, some 25 forced marriages take place every month in the Umerkot district.

Last year, prior to being elected, Imran Khan had pledged to safeguard the rights of minorities if ""he came into power"" and had announced that his government would take effective measures to prevent forced marriages of Hindu girls with Muslims.","['Bharat', 'Ak Dallas', 'Pakistan Kmkb', 'Pervez Khan', 'India Kmkb', 'Imtiaz Ali Khan', 'Common Sense', 'Ramesh Kumar', 'Singh Is King', 'Ramesh Kaushal']","Minister for Information Fawad Chaudhry, via tweets on Sunday, said that Prime Minister Khan has asked the Sindh and Punjab governments to investigate reports of the two minor girls being shifted to Rahim Yar Khan from Ghotki.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1591454,11/21/20 7:12,Document focusing on Covid-19’s impacts on women launched,"KARACHI: The Sindh Commission on the Status of Women (SCSW) in collaboration with Shirkat Gah-Women’s Resource Centre held the launch of Rising to the Challenges: Gender-Responsive Policy Options for Covid-19 & Other Emergencies, a policy document focusing on various impacts of Covid-19 on women here on Thursday.

According to the document, in a crisis such as the Covid-19 pandemic, women face considerable threats to their economic, physical, legal and social security.

The lack of emergency services especially exacerbates issues of access and relief for women and girls across the following four areas: reproductive health, gender-based violence, education and economic resilience, the document points out.

The document has been brought together through extensive input and feedback from experts in the field.

It recommends immediate legislative action such as expanding the definition of essential services to include all gender-based violence (GBV) response services and mechanisms to safeguard against any disruption during any emergency or disaster situations, strengthening services and ensuring access for GBV survivors during all emergencies, including Covid-19.

The policy also calls for expediting the implementation of the Sindh Reproductive Healthcare Rights Act 2019.

Need stressed to implement laws and prevent gender-based violence

The launch was also attended by parliamentarians, members of civil society, members of labour unions and many stakeholders.

Nuzhat Shirin, chairperson of the SCSW, welcomed the participants and highlighted the policy document, explaining immediate actions the SCSW took during Covid-19 pandemic.

Farida Shaheed, executive director, Shirkat Gah, presented the policy document’s key takeaways and urged present members of the Sindh government to take the policy up and ensure its timely implementation.

Aliya Shahid, secretary, Women Development Department (WDD), commended the policy document and stated that under the WDD platform, Sindh government carried out most pro-women legislation.

Dr Talib Lashari, a senior consultant, emphasised the rights of women and said that women’s rights could not be ensured until they invest in human capital and until poverty and education were focused on.

Virjee Kohli, special assistant, Sindh Human Rights Department, said that there was a need to implement laws and prevent gender-based violence incidents that affected young girls and women.

Khawar Mumtaz, former chairperson of the National Commission on the Status of Women, spoke on the policy document and stated that the interrelationships of different issues faced by women had been taken into account.

Dr Yasmin Qazi, senior technical adviser to Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, highlighted the importance of reproductive rights, and the need for gender sensitivity among men.

Barrister Murtaza Wahab, Adviser to Chief Minister of Sindh on Law and Environment, gave the closing remarks and complimented the SCSW and SG for the launch of the policy document. “We have too many challenges as a country and we need to rise to these challenges,” he said.

Barrister Wahab highlighted that there was a need for implementation and delivery of laws especially towards gender-based violence cases.

Police have been working independent of the civil bureaucracy ever since the introduction of the Police Order 2002, resisting tooth and nail any attempt to bring them back under the control of ‘baboos’ in any manner.

Officials who attended the meeting claimed that the orders to join hands did not mean that police were being placed under the control of bureaucracy. They were made to realise in the meeting that the governance could not improve without their total cooperation and they would be monitored through police Special Branch (undercover) as well as by digital means. They said IGP Shoaib Dastagir sat with the chief secretary when he gave the directions to all the regional police officers (RPOs), district police officers (DPOs), commissioners and deputy commissioners from the Civil Secretariat through a video link. All administrative secretaries also attended the conference.

While reviving the pre-2002 administrative model, the chief secretary made it clear in categorical terms that no-one failing to work jointly would be tolerated.

Police resisted bureaucrats since 2002; officials claim new order doesn’t mean placing police under bureaucracy

“I will personally monitor the arrangement and sort them out those not abiding by the orders. I have picked you all but will proceed against those not delivering jointly,” he warned, adding “you will feel my presence in your office through Special Branch and information technology.

The officials said that as per the directions, the RPOs would work hand in hand with divisional commissioners, DPOs with DCs, and SPs/SDPOs with ACs. They were ordered to hold joint meetings twice a week for better understanding, coordination and ironing out hurdles in their work.

The chief secretary said he was starting to visit divisional headquarters with the IGP to ensure the ordered cooperation and overall performance of the police and administrative officers, to give them guidance and sort out their problems to meet the governance challenges.

The field officers were asked to pay attention to service delivery, transparency and good governance. Other directions were to ensure punctuality, meet people for 90 minutes every day at a fixed time without fail to resolve their problems and make public their activities on social media for accountability and transparency.

They were asked to entertain parliamentarians’ lawful requests. In case of any clash with government policy and rules, they should seek guidance of their seniors, but give relief if possible through their discretionary powers.

The RPOs and divisional commissioners and DPOs and DCs were asked to hold monthly meetings with the parliamentarians of their areas for resolving their problems. They should also hold ‘genuine’ open kutcheries regularly as Special Branch personnel would be there to detect ‘touts’ helping produce such fake gatherings. All the commissioners and RPOs were directed to compile lists of officers/officials not required.

They were ordered to prominently display regular meeting hours and adopt measures to ensure people’s direct access to officers without interference of staff at sub-offices at tehsil level.

The DPOs and DCs were directed to improve traffic at any cost, discourage wrong parking and jointly remove encroachments without caring for the rank and file of the encroachers.

“Pay attention to media reports and correct yourself in their light,” the chief secretary said.

The officers were also asked to supervise auction in wholesale fruit and vegetable markets. All the RPOs and commissioners should do the same at least twice a week so as to control inflation.

“This is a very serious governance issue and no negligence would be tolerated,” he said.

Mr Khan asked the Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) to arrange for performance dashboards of the field bureaucracy (police and administration).

Finally, he ordered all administrative secretaries to ensure service delivery and conduct field visits to find out any shortcomings. They should also daily meet general the daily at a fixed time for 90 minutes to listen to their woes.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1356509,9/9/17 7:14,"‘35pc of pregnancies end due to abortions, complications’","ISLAMABAD: Every year, 35pc of pregnancies end due to abortions and other complications, the head of the Department of Gynaecology at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) said on Friday.

While briefing the National Assembly Standing Committee on National Health Services (NHS), Dr Nasira Tasneem said statistics for 2012 showed that 2.2 million abortions were carried out in Pakistan.

According to estimates, almost 20pc of pregnancies end in abortions every year, she said.

The briefing was arranged on behalf of the Ministry of Capital Administration and Development Division.

Dr Tasneem said that according to a study, ‘Post-abortion care in Pakistan: a national study’ conducted by the Population Council in 2012, nearly 700,000 women in Pakistan faced complications because of unsafe abortions which were done spontaneously (on instructions of gynaecologists) or with the will of the couples.

The study highlighted that the current law in Pakistan permitted abortion to save a woman’s life and provide “necessary treatment.” Due to these legal restrictions and a lack of clarity among women and healthcare providers in interpreting the law, women are forced to seek abortions by untrained providers, she added.

After the briefing, Khalid Hussain Magsi, the chairman of the committee, expressed disappointment over the situation and said five years were wasted and the committee could not do anything to address public issues.

“Unfortunately, most of the debates could not reach conclusions due to which policies could not be finalised. Because of a lack of policies, common people suffer more as the elite class has many ways out.”

Mr Magsi said proper healthcare facilities could not be provided to the citizens even in the federal capital.

“In Islamabad, health institutions are being controlled by three ministries. One can imagine what would be the condition in other regions of the country,” he said.

Minister NHS Saira Afzal Tarar said the healthcare facilities in Islamabad were the worst compared to undeveloped areas of the country because health institutions were controlled by more than one controlling authorities in the federal capital.

“That is why we have suggested establishing a Federal Health Authority to control all the health institutions in the capital. I have talked to the prime minister who has promised to look into the issue.”

She suggested raising a point of order in parliament to ascertain under which ministry the healthcare institutions are working.

Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani said the condition of healthcare institutions can never be improved unless they were controlled by one authority.

The committee recommended that all the health institutions should be placed under the Ministry of NHS.

Two bills deferred

The committee decided to defer “The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Bill” moved by MNA Parveen Masood Bhatti and “The Prohibition of Smoking and Protection of Non-Smokers Health Bill” moved by MNA Dr Nikhat Shakeel Khan to the next meeting.

The girl was said to have an affair with a boy from the same village against the wishes of their families and they both had fled to Karachi a few days ago. However, her father convinced them that the family had forgiven them and they should return home.

When the two returned, the girl’s father Muhammad Anwar Jutt along with Ihsan and Zaraat allegedly gunned down the couple.

Police shifted the bodies to the Kharian Tehsil Headquarters Hospital for autopsy, while three suspects were detained and an investigation started.

MURDER CASE SOLVED: Police claimed to have resolved the murder case of an expatriate Pakistani, as his wife turned out to be his killer to marry another man in Mararian village.

Asad Gujjar, a spokesman for Gujrat police, said that Sajjad Shah had lodged a complaint with the police on July 9, saying that his nephew, Yasir Shah, had recently returned from Saudi Arabia. A few days later the nephew’s wife Sana Liaqat told the family that Yasir had died of a heart attack.

However, he suspected that his nephew had been murdered. Police later detained Sana, who confessed during investigation to have killed her husband through asphyxiation after intoxicating him on June 11. She added that she loved another man, who along with two accomplices had helped her in the killing.

Police registered a case against the suspects and arrested those nominated in the case. Now, police will approach a local court for exhumation of Yasir’s body to conduct an autopsy so that the cause of death could be ascertained.

Samples from the body will be sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency for analysis.

Taken from 85 newspapers, the results are horrifying: 3,832 cases of sexual abuse were reported in 2018.

The majority (63pc) of cases were reported from Punjab, followed by 34pc from Azad Kashmir, 27pc from Sindh, 4pc from KP, 2pc from Balochistan, 3pc from Islamabad, and six cases from Gilgit-Baltistan.

Out of the total number of victims, 55pc victims were girls and 45pc were boys.

When keeping in mind that these are simply the number of reported cases in a country where people are understandably apprehensive about reaching out to law-enforcement agencies over crimes of a sexual nature, it becomes clear that this is just the tip of the iceberg.

So many children — with no agency, and taught from a young age to obey and not question adults — suffer in silence, particularly due to the culture of shame surrounding the topic.

In many cases, the perpetrators of sexual abuse and violence are acquainted with the victim and/or his/her family members.

On the same day that Sahil’s findings were released, the tragic end of 12-year-old Ali Hassan from Lahore was reported. On his mother’s instructions, the boy had left his home to collect some money from his neighbours. He never returned. Three weeks later, his body was found. Strangled to death, his body was then burnt by his kidnappers, who did not want his identity to be revealed. The case may not have been sexual in nature but revealed the dangers faced by our most vulnerable segment of society.

Better laws are needed for the protection of our children, including, as suggested, the creation of child-friendly courts.

Just last month, a 14-year-old boy was on his way to a coaching centre in Rawalpindi when he was shot dead after resisting a rape attempt. Another boy took his own life after being sexually assaulted by two adult men in Battagram. His ordeal was filmed by the monstrous perpetrators, who then tried to blackmail him with the images.

The list of victims is endless. It did not start with Zainab in 2018, or with Kasur in 2015. Indeed, the abuse and sexual abuse of children is this nation’s hidden shame. The cycle of violence will only end when the culture of silence ends. We need to start having that difficult conversation now.

At a seminar, she said the government is committed to ensuring an equal environment for all and to ending gender-based violence.

She said that in addition to effective implementation of existing laws, new legislation to protect the rights of every citizen – women and children in particular – from domestic violence is on the cards as well.

The minister also claimed the state of human rights in Pakistan is far better than many other countries.

Dr Mazari was speaking at an event titled ‘Striving to Protect and Uphold Equal Rights for All: A Public-Private Drive to End Gender Based Violence’ organised by the Islamabad police and Rozan.

Minister of State for Interior Shehryar Afridi was also present.

The seminar aimed to generate discourse on action required to end gender-based violence and to share steps taken by the police to deal with the issue.

Dr Mazari told participants that the government is committed to providing all possible support to survivors of violence.

“Besides implementing laws, there is a need to change the society’s mindset to end the gender based violence. Our ministry is working on creating awareness about the laws, especially for sensitization of public,” she said.

She said gender-based violence in a central issue and needs to be tackled as a priority. She added that increasing violence against marginalised groups requires a sensitised and professional police force, and praised the Islamabad police for professionalism and for their performance.

She said the police perform their duties for the public’s safety and security and urged people to respect them.

Dr Mazari said minorities are being given their own personal laws, saying that the Hindu divorce and marriage law already exists and a Christian divorce bill will be presented in parliament soon.

She added that steps are being taken for the welfare of the transgender community and to ensure the implementation of the transgender law.

A separate ward has been set up for transgender patients at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, she said, and they are receiving treatment free of charge and without any inconvenience.

She added that a domestic workers bill has already been approved by cabinet and will be presented in parliament soon.

https://images.dawn.com/news/1185600,8/4/20 12:15,Ayesha Omar opens up about being a sexual assault survivor to Rose McGowan,"In light of the #MeToo movement that grew in strength after women started coming out with their stories, actor and director Rose McGowan opened up about her struggle in 2017, 20 years after she was assaulted by Harvey Weinstein, the now disgraced American producer.

In a live Instagram conversation with Ayesha Omar, McGowan revealed how she gathered the strength to finally speak about what had happened to her.

A photo posted by Instagram (@instagram) on Mar 22, 2015 at 11:21am PDT

""I always had a voice, just no one was listening,"" she Rose. ""I was waiting for society to be ready. I needed Trump. Hilary Clinton protected Weinstein in a major way. I needed Trump to show people this is racism, sexism, and this is what ugliness really looks like.""

As a survivor standing against the world, she also opened up about going through the ordeal alone.

""I didn't have friends. No women's groups to help me, nothing.""

However, she was confident that the harasser was the only one to blame.

""It was never my shame,"" Rose said, as she often waited for someone she could meet one day, who would make a difference in the way things were happening. ""And then I thought, nope, it's gonna be me.""

Omar also added how being in Pakistani society, fear and shame are two dominant emotions for women in such circumstances. ""We are not allowed to be angry,"" said the Bulbulay actress.

The duo then together discussed how the blame of assault is usually shifted on women. Sometimes through clothing, and other times because they are just ""asking for it"".

""#MeToo triggered people all over the world; it's a communication tool, it's there to say, I know your pain,"" said McGowan. Soon after, Ayesha too, shared the story of her own assault.

""A huge powerful man, twice my age. I had just entered the industry, I was this young 23-year-old, fresh out of college, and bam, this started happening. And it went on for years,"" she shared.

""It wasn't a one-off incident, and I just didn't want to process it. I put in a box, and I said okay, this is happening in my life, I have to deal with it. I didn't wanna share it with anybody. I let it stay there for 15 years, and I finally spoke about it to someone two years ago.""

""A friend of mine from the industry also came out with her story, and TV channels started calling me up and asking 'Do you think she's telling the truth?'"" Ayesha told Rose.

""And I said 'I would believe any victim'. They asked me if sexual harassment happens in the industry and that's the first time I said yes. They asked if it happened to you, and I said yes. I will talk about it someday, but not today. I still haven't named my monster but I've started talking about it,"" Omar said.

Rose also mentioned how her own activism too started way before the Weinstein incident.

""I'm really about men and women to see each other as human, and not through gender,"" she concluded.","['Images Staff', 'Desk Report', 'A Huge Powerful Man', 'Twice My Age', 'When I Had Just Entered The Industry At And It Went On For Years', 'Shared Ayesha', 'Indie Guy', 'M.

https://www.dawn.com/news/716076/forced-marriage-threat-made-to-ngo-women-2,5/5/12 23:15,Forced marriage threat made to NGO women,"MANSEHRA, May 5: Former Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal MNA from Kohistan Maulvi Abdul Haleem on Saturday warned women working in nongovernmental organisations against entering his district and said violators of the warning would be forcibly married off to locals.

“I issued a decree during Friday sermon that getting education for degrees by women is repugnant to Islamic injunctions because if a woman gets degree, she may use it for job, an act which Islam doesn’t allow in absence of mehram (close relatives),” he told reporters here.

Mr Haleem said: “If women working in NGOs enter Kohistan, we won’t spare them and solemnise their nikkah (marriage) with local men.”

Maulana Haleem, who remained MNA during the Musharraf regime, said if a woman got education and used it for job, then it was against the teachings of Islam.

“That’s why girls are not going to schools in Kohistan and girl schools are used as cattle pen,” he said.

The ex-MNA, who was once a mufti at Darul Uloom Haqqania, Akora Khattak, and also taught top clerics Maulana Samiul Haq, Maulana Anwarul Haq, Maulana Nizamuddin Shamazai, said he was not opposed to NGOs and would ensure complete protection of their male staffers in Kohistan.

He said if NGOs wanted to work for women’s development, they should spend money for the purpose through government departments.

“We won’t let them (NGOs) influence our women in the name of empowerment and financial support through women workers of NGOs,” said the ex-MNA, who remained the district chairman in Kohistan during the General Ziaul Haq regime.

He said he issued a decree in the past in favour of poppy cultivation and trade and continued to believe so.

“I also rose up against the unjustified slaughtering of animals by Jehanzeb Khan, the ruler of the formerly Swat state, at his birthday. Kohistan was part of the state of Swat at that time. Even he (ruler) put me behind the bars but I didn’t withdraw the decree,” he said.

The ex-MNA said killing of women in the name of honour was a ‘local custom and religious practice’ in Kohistan.

He said if someone witnessed female members of his family roaming with ghair mehram (other than close relatives), he could kill her without producing four witnesses,” he said.

Meanwhile, a man was killed and his father and two brothers critically wounded on Saturday when their rival tribesmen attacked their house in Palis area.

A dispute over the ownership of a water reservoir was blamed for the Narng Shahkhail attack on Badakhail tribesmen.

The dead included Azizur Rehman, while the injured were his father, Mohammad Asghar, and his brothers, Mohammad Essa and Abdul Quddos, whose condition was stated be critical at a local hospital.

The Palis police lodged an FIR and began investigation.

Last year, four people were killed and three injured when Badakhail and Narng Shah-khail tribes exchanged heavy fire over the same dispute.","[""The Newspaper'S Correspondent"", 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1533010,2/7/20 14:08,NA passes contentious resolution calling for public hanging of child sexual abusers,"A resolution calling for the public hanging of offenders convicted for sexually abusing and murdering children was passed in the National Assembly on Friday with a majority of votes.

The session was presided over by Deputy Speaker Qasim Khan Suri.

The hand-written resolution, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, referred to the ""brutal killing of 8-year-old Iwaz Noor in Nowshera"".

""Strongly condemning"" the death, the signatories wrote: ""This house [...] demands that to stop these shameful and brutal killings of children and give a strong deterrent effect, the killers and rapists should not only be given death penalty by hanging but they should be hanged publicly.""

Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan presented the resolution in the parliament, which was passed by all lawmakers, apart from PPP's.

Raja Pervez Ashraf, PPP leader and former prime minister, said: ""Ramping up the severity of punishments does not result in a reduction in crime.""

""We cannot put public hanging into practice as it violates the laws of the United Nations,"" he added, reminding members of the parliament that Pakistan is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

He was not the only one to raise his voice against the passing of the resolution. Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry ""strongly condemned"" it.

""This is just another grave act in line with brutal civilisation practices. Societies act in a balanced way. Barbarism is not the answer to crimes [...] this is another expression of extremism,"" he wrote on Twitter.

Meanwhile, Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari clarified that the resolution ""was not government-sponsored but an individual act"".

""Many of us oppose it — our MOHR (Ministry of Human Rights) strongly opposes this. Unfortunately I was in a meeting and wasn't able to go to NA,"" she said, in a post on Twitter.

According to a report released by child rights organisation Sahil in September last year, 1,304 cases of sexual abuse of children were reported by the media in the country from January to June.

This means that at least seven children are abused every day.

With the issue continuing to remain widely prevalent, the government has been met with criticism for not taking any concrete measures to address flaws in the investigation of such cases or the implementation of the relevant laws.

Perspective: Why sexual abuse of children remains widely prevalent

Existing laws

Presently, multiple laws are available in the country for dealing with child-related offences.

Punjab was the first province where a law on child protection was enacted in 2004. The Punjab Destitute and Neglected Children Act, 2004, deals with a variety of issues related to child protection. The law gives a definition of ‘destitute and neglected child.’

Under this law, a child protection and welfare bureau has to be set up with wide-ranging functions. The bureau has also to set up child protection institutions in different areas.

The KP Child Protection and Welfare Act (CPWA) was enacted in 2010. This law is more comprehensive than that of Punjab. The KP law included several offences against children with prescribed punishments. The offences incorporated in the Act include: child pornography, sexual abuse, sale in child organs, corporal punishment and child begging and trafficking.

The KP Act provides for setting up of child protection bodies, including child protection courts, the Child Protection and Welfare Commission, child protection units on district level, child protection institute, etc.

The Sindh Child Protection Authority Act, 2011, was enacted in June 2011. This law makes it binding on the provincial government to establish Sindh Child Protection Authority, which is chaired by minister for social welfare. The authority has to set up child protection units and also appoint child protection officers. However, this law is not as comprehensive as that of KP and Punjab.

Balochistan Child Protection Act, 2016, was enacted in November 2016. This law includes definitions of different categories of violence against children, including mental violence, physical violence, sexual abuse and exploitation, etc. It provides for setting up of a child protection commission on provincial level and child protection units on district level.

Several important amendments were made in Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) through the Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Act, 2016, which was enacted in March 2016. Some of the provisions included in PPC are similar to the one available in KP CPWA, including offences related to exposure to seduction, child pornography, sexual abuse, etc.

Similarly, new sections 377A and 377B were incorporated in PPC in which a detailed definition of sexual abuse and its punishment are given.

In 2018, an amendment was made in Section 377B of the PPC to make the punishment for sexual abuse more stringent. It now provides imprisonment which shall not be less than 14 years and may extend to 20 years with minimum fine of Rs1 million.

Similarly, in the 2016 amendments the offence of child pornography was made punishable to minimum two years imprisonment and maximum seven years besides fine.

However, through amendments in 2018, the said offence was made punishable with at least 14 years imprisonment and maximum 20 years imprisonment with minimum fine of Rs1 million.

Moreover, in 2016 death penalty was introduced for raping a minor. The Criminal Law (Amendment) (Offences related to rape) Act, 2016, was introduced in 2016.

Under those amendments, a sub-section 3 was included in Section 376 of the PPC which provides: “Whoever commits rape of a minor or a person with mental or physical disability shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life.”","['Javed Hussain', 'Prakash Jha', 'Changez Khan', 'Dr Vikas Jamwal', 'Merge Of Equals', 'Common Sense', 'Adil Mustafa', 'Jimmy Thappa', 'Blue Knight', 'Salim Khan']","The offences incorporated in the Act include: child pornography, sexual abuse, sale in child organs, corporal punishment and child begging and trafficking.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1374887,12/6/17 7:40,Effective laws sought to prevent gender-based violence,"PESHAWAR: The representatives of various civil society organisations have demanded of the provincial government to make proper legislation for prevention of gender-based violence, early age marriages and sexual harassment in the province.

Addressing a press conference at Peshawar Press Club on Tuesday, the representatives of ‘Partner for Prevention of Response’, an alliance of CSOs working on pro-women laws, said that provincial government enacted laws on other issues but it failed to prevent gender-based violence.

Qamar Naseem, the coordinator of Blue Veins, said that hunger, poverty and violence were root causes of early age marriages in the country.

He said that nearly half of the population consisted of girls and women, so the country could not achieve developmental goals and progress until womenfolk get rid of hunger and violence.

Lawmakers asked to expedite legislation process to stop early age marriages

Flanked by Pakhtunkhwa Civil Society Network representative Taimoor Kamal, Sikh community representative Radish Tony and Quratul Ain, Mr Naseem said that government failed to legislate to prevent domestic violence and early age marriages in the province. He called upon the government to enact effective laws to protect girls and women from violence.

According to Unicef, he said, nearly 21 per cent girls in the country were married off before they reached the age of 18. He said that the tendency was creating complications in the society. Referring to a report of Pakistan Human Rights Commission, he said that percentage of early age marriages was around 74 in some districts of the province.

Quratul Ain, a women right activist, said on the occasion that lack of coordination between government and people was basic reason behind the growing tendency of early age marriage in those districts.

She said that the existing laws on protection of women rights had so far not implemented effectively because those were passed without proper consultation with relevant stakeholders.

As compared to Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ms Ain said, Sindh and Punjab governments made sufficient legislation for prevention of early age marriages. She said the maximum age limit for girl marriage was around 16 years but the provincial government failed to implement it.

She urged the provincial lawmakers to expedite the legislation process and pass laws to eradicate domestic violence against women and early age marriages in the province.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1565057,6/25/20 6:51,Videos of police brutality trigger outrage on social media,"PESHAWAR: Disturbing videos of police personnel stripping and torturing an accused inside a police station emerged here on Wednesday and led to a social media uproar over police brutality.

The episode involving Radiullah alias Amiray, a resident of Tehkal, had been doing the round on the social media for past more than a week after the accused apparently under the influence of some intoxicant cursed police officers and later he was taken into custody on charges of possessing drugs along with two other persons.

The accused, who was referring to himself as a province, was turned into butt of memes for several days; however, two videos that emerged on Wednesday wherein policemen could be seen stripping him turned the light banter into a social media outrage.

First video of 19 seconds length, which emerged on Wednesday morning, showed two policemen forcing the semi-naked accused into a room, while two others could be seen following them. Another video of 36 seconds length showed the cops forcing the semi-naked accused to pose for mobile phone video.

Four cops suspended as politicians, lawyers and NGOs seek judicial probe into incident

Social media erupted into an uproar soon after the videos made their way into cyber sphere, while workers of Jamaat-i-Islami and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Civil Society Network took to the streets to protest the inhuman treatment meted to the detainee.

A trend #JusticeforAmir was trending on top in Pakistan with more than 15,000 tweets for several hours till the filing of this report.

Soon after the social media outrage, city police issued a notification announcing to suspend four policemen including Tehkal SHO Shahryar Khan. It said that Shahryar Khan, Zahirullah, Naeem and Tauseef were suspended on account of gross misconduct. It said that the policemen were being charge-sheeted with summary of allegations for departmental action.

Tehkal police later in the day also booked three of them including Zahirullah, Tauseef and Naeem under section 355, 118 and 119 of Pakistan Penal Code for using criminal force to dishonour someone and public servant concealing design commit offence, which is his duty to prevent.

Chief Minister Mahmood Khan also directed the authorities concerned to arrest the policemen, who were dishonouring the citizen. Directorate of Human Rights also ordered an inquiry into the incident and directed an official to look into the matter and present report within three days.

SSP Zahoor Afridi said that police had taken strict notice of the incident and whoever was responsible would be taken to the task. He said that three policemen booked and arrested for dishonouring the citizen while the SHO was suspended for poor supervision.

Amiray was taken into custody by police on June 16 after a video went viral wherein he could be seen cursing police officials. Police charged him along with two other accused identified as Shakil and Mohammad Khan under section 11 of CNSA, section of 15 Arms Act, 4-PO and section 14 of Foreigners Act.

A day later another video emerged where the accused could be seen begging police and saying that he was sorry for his mistake. A policeman, who is not seen in the video, apparently in reference to videos that emerged on Wednesday, mockingly asks him whether he has enjoyed the hospitality in the police station. “How you were honoured at the police station,” he asks the accused twice.

Sources familiar with Amir told Dawn that he was an Afghan refugee living in Tehkal. They said that he used to work at Spring Carnival wedding hall on University Road as waiter and was rendered jobless due to lockdown resulting from Covid-19 outbreak. However, a staffer at the wedding hall said that they had terminated him about eight months ago as his appearance was not suitable for working in family setting.

A man, who has worked along with the accused for several years, said that he was a good guy and had a BA degree. He said that before the emergence of his drunken video, never for once he had seen him doing drugs.

Meanwhile, Pakistan Jurists Association (PJA) in an emergency meeting held with a senior lawyer Saifullah Muhib Kakakhel in the chair said that policemen misused their powers by lodging a fake FIR in reaction and arresting Amiray.

“In police custody, he was undressed, humiliated and sexually harassed by the whole police station of Tehkal. He received injuries in police custody and was also victim of sexual abuse. The acts of police were inhumane, unlawful and against the dignity and privacy of human being,” PJA alleged in a statement.

The members of PJA said that no doubt the man uploaded a video in which he abused the police officers but the treatment and reaction of police was unjustified and not permissible under the law.

PJA demand of Chief Justice of Pakistan, chief justice of Peshawar High Court, IGP, chief minister and other high-ups to take stern action against the policemen involved in the incident.

In their separate statements, ANP provincial president Aimal Wali Khan, QWP provincial chairman Sikandar Hayat Khan Sherpao, Peshawar District Bar Association president Advocate Akhtar Biland, JUI-F provincial deputy general secretary Maulana Ahmad Ali Darvesh also condemned the policemen and demanded judicial probe into incident.

Our correspondent from Charsadda adds: Demonstrations were held in the district to protest police violence against a man in Peshawar. The rallies were led by JI youth and NGOs.

The protesters demanded of chief justice of Peshawar High Court and Chief Justice of Pakistan to take suo moto notice of the incident.

The protesters demanded of chief justice of Peshawar High Court and Chief Justice of Pakistan to take suo moto notice of the incident.","['trigger', 'peshawar', 'outrage', 'social', 'videos', 'policemen', 'video', 'seen', 'pakistan', 'brutality', 'chief', 'emerged', 'media', 'accused', 'khan']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/09/5d803ef715c9e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30374b43a7.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/10/5d9c69e10dcb9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/09/5d803ef715c9e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/06/5ef3be9bc4a41.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/09/5d7b87c6500fd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd309b711467.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/10/5d9c69e10dcb9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/09/5d7b87c6500fd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/06/5ef3be9bc4a41.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd306ee076b9.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/06/5ef3be9bc4a41.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Four cops suspended as politicians, lawyers and NGOs seek judicial probe into incident.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1565057', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Videos of police brutality trigger outrage on social media', 'description': 'Four cops suspended as politicians, lawyers and NGOs seek judicial probe into incident.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/06/5ef3be9bc4a41.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1565057', 'title': 'Videos of police brutality trigger outrage on social media', 'description': 'Four cops suspended as politicians, lawyers and NGOs seek judicial probe into incident.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/06/5ef3be9bc4a41.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-06-25 06:51:05', 'modified_time': '2020-06-25 11:29:22', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/4534/manzoor-ali'}, 'author': 'Ali Hazrat Bacha | Manzoor Ali'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1398648,3/31/18 10:28,"Pakistan, India agree to end envoys harassment","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and India on Friday agreed to address complaints of harassment of diplomats in accordance with the bilaterally agreed 1992 ‘Code of Conduct’ on treatment of diplomatic and consular staff in each other’s country.

The agreement was announced through a statement simultaneously issued by the Foreign Office and the Indian Ministry of External Affairs.

The statement reads: “India and Pakistan have mutually agreed to resolve matters related to the treatment of diplomats and diplomatic premises, in line with the 1992 ‘Code of Conduct’ for treatment of diplomatic/consular personnel in India and Pakistan.”

The discussions between the two countries had begun after Pakistan recalled its High Commissioner Sohail Mahmood for consultations following a spike in incidents of harassment of Pakistani diplomats in Delhi. India, meanwhile, too had been complaining about the treatment of its diplomats in Islamabad.

It is said that over 50 incidents of harassment of Pakistani diplomats and their families took place between March 7 and 23. It turned ugly when the children of Pakistani diplomats while on way to their schools were stopped and harassed.

Both countries will adhere to 1992 Code of Conduct on treatment of diplomatic staff

India, meanwhile, claims to have sent 15 note verbales to the Foreign Office to protest over alleged maltreatment of their diplomats in Pakistan.

The harassment of Pak­istani diplomats had incre­ased after security agencies in Islamabad insisted that the employees of a private contractor working on Indian High Commission’s residential complex get security clearance. This requirement was misread in Delhi as coercive and agencies there started harassing Pakistani diplomats.

The discussions on addressing each other’s complaints had significantly progressed when High Commissioner Mahmood last week returned to New Delhi. His visit to Ajmer Sharif for attending the Urs of Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti became possible because of the flexibility shown by the host after behind-the-scenes talks.

Similarly, in Islamabad, Indian diplomats after a long break attended the March 23 Joint Services Parade.

After Mr Mahmood’s return to Delhi, the foreign secretaries of Pakistan and India met the high commissioners of the other side in their capitals and reached this agreement. The agreement, multiple sources confirmed, had been finalised a couple of days before its formal announcement when Indian High Commissioner Ajay Bisaria met Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua. Bisaria is currently visiting Lahore.

High Commissioner Mahmood had met Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale in Delhi.

Code of conduct

The 1992 Code of Conduct was signed by then foreign secretary Shaharyar Khan and his Indian counterpart J.N. Dixit for “smooth and unhindered functioning” of each other’s diplomatic missions and consular staff and to ensure that the privileges and immunities of the diplomatic and consular staff and premises were not violated.

The 12-point code of conduct provides for guaranteeing dignity and personal inviolability of diplomatic and consular personnel posted in each other’s country; avoidance of intrusive and aggressive surveillance, harassment, threatening, tailing of cars and trespassing on residences; safety and security of the diplomatic and consular staff and their families and unhindered working of the local domestic staff engaged by diplomats at their residences; no harassment and questioning of visitors; inviolability of official and private vehicles of the diplomatic and consular staff; respect for religious, social and cultural sensitivities of the host state; and the strength of missions and the procedure for issuance of visas to diplomatic and consular staff.

The code of conduct describes the process for dealing with complaints and cases of breach of diplomatic protocols by the diplomats and consular staff. It also envisages facilitation for media personnel.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1561843,6/7/20 6:49,Punjab police use stun therapy on SOP violators,"FAISALABAD: Despite opposition by international human rights bodies like the Amnesty International (AI), stun batons are being used with impunity by local police and other law-enforcement agencies against those flouting Covid-19 related standard operating procedures (SOPs), obviously with the consent of a government whose job is to procure and supply these torture tools to law enforcers.

Stun guns and stun batons are gadgets that inflict a high-frequency shock to the victim, causing loss of balance and muscle control, mental confusion and disorientation, if for only a few seconds.

On Saturday, the district administration and police were witnessed using stun batons on the city roads against those flouting Covid-19 SOPs, especially those who were not wearing masks.

The Amnesty International (AI) is campaigning worldwide for banning the use and trade of torture tools like stun baton, stun belts, spike batons, neck cuffs etc. It argues that no one should profit from pain and suffering of people.

The AI also demands that the United Nations member states should work towards regulations aimed at ending the torture tools trade for good.

Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Ali and Senior Superintendent of Police (operations) Syed Ali Raza led their subordinates on various city roads, including Jail Road and Chenab Chowk where people, mostly motorcyclists and those traveling by motorcycle-rickshaws, not wearing masks, were lined up facing walls and subjected to stun baton shocks.

This new mode of public torture, carried out by plainclothesmen, terrorised the people, besides causing pain to those declared as violators.

According to the AI, gadgets like stun baton come handy for state officials to inflict painful electric shocks to the bodies of the targeted people without leaving any long-lasting physical traces.

Aslam, a motorcyclist who was subjected to such torture on Jail Road, narrating his ordeal said: “I was going on a bike with a friend when a man carrying a strange-looking baton approached us and asked us to line up against a wall along the road. He asked why I was not wearing a mask. Before I could answer, he gave me an electric shock with the baton, causing me immense pain. It was so sudden and painful that for a few seconds I felt like I was dying.”

He said the shock left him in a daze for a couple of minutes.

“The official could have imposed a fine or even arrested me, instead of inflicting an electric shock that might cause me a serious physical harm,” he lamented. This scribe tried to contact the deputy commissioner and the SSP for their versions on their phones but the officers did not reply.

A police officer, seeking anonymity, said the higher authorities were quite aware of the use of stun batons to control violators and protesters as these gadgets were procured and provide to various departments on their orders.

Justifying the use of stun batons, he said these would be helpful in keeping the people indoors during the pandemic and making them follow the SOPs in public places.

Meanwhile, through a handout, the district administration has warned those leaving their homes without masks of strict action.

The administration also sealed shops in different areas of the city for violation of the SOPs.

At some places, the traffic police employees deflated tyres of vehicles of those who were not wearing masks.

The district administration spokesman said the gadgets had been procured by the civil defense department to control coronavirus patients housed in Paras Quarantine Centre. He claimed the device gave 4 to 5 watts shock and had no side effects.

Following a recent complaint, he claimed, the district administration had banned its use by civil defense staff, adding “it should be used for the purpose for which it was purchased”.

Coleman Boyle gave birth to three children in captivity. She and her Canadian husband were abducted by the Haqqani network while travelling through a remote area of Afghanistan — for reasons that remain unclear — in 2012.

The family were released last month in Pakistan and are now trying to rebuild their lives in Canada.

She said their guards “could be very violent, even sometimes with the children,” assaulting their now four-year-old son with a stick, and hitting her and her husband.

“I would get beaten or hit or thrown on the ground,” she told ABC News. She broke a cheekbone and three fingers while intervening to protect the children, her husband, Joshua Boyle, 34, told ABC.

They made toys out of bottle caps and bits of cardboard, and fearing the family could be beheaded, they made up a game based on England’s Charles I, who was executed in 1649, and Oliver Cromwell, she said.

“Obviously with people like this, the idea of a beheading is always on the table, so he certainly knew that this type of thing could happen to his family but then we would come up with games to make it not seem so scary,” she said.

“He had great fun pretending to be Oliver Cromwell and chasing Charles I around and trying to behead him,” she said. “We made it a game so that he wasn’t afraid.”

After the family returned to Canada last month, Boyle, 34, accused his kidnappers of murdering an infant daughter through a “forced abortion” and of raping his wife.

“They came into the cell, and they took my husband out forcibly, dragging him out, and one of the guards threw me down on the ground, hitting me and shouting `I will kill you, I will kill you’,” she said.

“And that’s when the assault happened. It was with two men. And then there was a third at the door. And afterwards, the animals wouldn’t even give me back my clothes.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/737717,7/27/12 23:51,Three denied bail in honour killing case,"PESHAWAR, July 27: A single-member Peshawar High Court bench on Friday dismissed the petition of a woman and her two relatives for bail in an honour-related killing of her daughter and two grandchildren in Mardan district.

Chief Justice Dost Mohammad Khan observed that keeping in view the evidence on record, the three petitioners didn’t deserve to be freed on bail.

The petitioners, Niaz Bibi, her sister Zeenat Bibi and Zeenat’s husband Aurangzeb were arrested by police after re-investigation into the case was conducted by the crimes branch police on the orders of the high court.

The issue surfaced on December 8, 2011 when the bodies of a woman, Nargis, and her two children, Shahan aged one-and-a-half years and Alisha aged three years, were recovered from the jurisdiction of Par Hoti police station in Mardan.

They were killed and their bodies were dismembered.

Later, the slain woman’s parents charged her husband, Ahtesham, and his two brothers, Mohammad Iqbal and Mohammad Ashfaq, with the killings leading to their arrest.

The chief justice had taken a suo motu notice of the killings at the written request of the arrested men’s sister for reinvestigation into the matter. The chief justice later ordered reinvestigation into the case by the crimes branch police.

Later, Ahtesham and his brothers were granted bail by the high court after reinvestigation found them innocent.

Sahibzada Riazatul Haq, lawyer for Ahtesham, said the three petitioners were part of the killing conspiracy.

He said two of the accused, Aurangzeb and Bashir, had already confessed to the killing and named their accomplices.

The chief justice appreciated the efforts of two investigation officers, DSP Inayat Shah and sub-inspector Hasnain Agha, and observed that they should be rewarded and given commendation certificates for tracing suspects.

The reinvestigation by the crimes branch showed that the woman had left her residence a few years ago before marrying Ahtesham of her own free will and moving to Rawalpindi.

It also said the woman’s parents and other family members planned to kill her and her two children and invited them to their house in Mardan for it.

For reinvestigation, police arrested six people, including mother of the slain woman Niaz Bibi, her brother Kalimullah, husband of her sister, Arbab Nasir and her maternal aunt, Zeenat Bibi, in addition to Aurangzeb and Bashir.

The investigators learned that the accused had promised Arbab Nasir that if he killed Nargis and her children, her sister would be married to him, and after the three were killed, the said marriage took place.","['Bureau Report', 'Images Staff', 'Khurram Husain', 'F.S.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1409843,5/25/18 6:58,Pakistan woman flies back to Italy after forced abortion,"Italy’s foreign minister tweeted a picture of Farah after her arrival at the ambassador’s residence in Islamabad.

ROME: Italy’s foreign minister proudly announced the return to the country on Thursday of a Pakistani woman who it claimed had been taken by her family to Pakistan to have an abortion against her will after she got pregnant by her Italian boyfriend.

The case of young Farah attracted a lot of interest in Italy following the recent strangulation in Pakistan of Sana Cheema, an Italian of Pakistani origin who police suspect was killed by her family because she refused an arranged marriage.

Farah, 19, didn’t have Italian citizenship, only a residency permit. Nevertheless, the foreign ministry activated Italy’s embassy in Islamabad after Verona authorities heard from Farah’s friends that she had been tricked into going home and was forced to have an abortion.

Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano tweeted on Thursday that Farah was safely back in Italy, and he thanked Pakistani authorities who had removed Farah from her family’s home in a Lahore area and brought her to the Italian embassy in Islamabad.

Italian politicians join hands to express solidarity with Farah

Alfano had previously said that Italy acted in Farah’s defence as a matter of respecting her human rights and “fundamental rights based on the equality of men and women.”

According to Italian news reports, Farah managed to sneak text and audio messages to her friends in Italy, recounting that her parents had tricked her into returning to Pakistan for her brother’s wedding and then forced her to abort her child. She wrote of being afraid for her life.

Once in the embassy, Italy arranged for Farah’s Pakistani passport to be renewed as her family had destroyed the one she travelled with and issued her a visa to return to Italy.

Farah’s case prompted an outpouring of solidarity from Italian politicians from across the political spectrum eager to prevent a repetition of the Cheema case.

Verona’s social services office, which had received complaints from Farah previously about her abusive father, guaranteed her needs would be met and safety ensured.

Left-leaning lawmaker Laura Boldrini, the former house speaker, praised Farah for raising her voice and “making us understand that when a woman rebels against those who want to oppress her, she will never be left alone”. Right-wing leader Giorgia Meloni, who has demanded a harsher crackdown on illegal immigrants, went so far as to call for Italy to grant Farah citizenship.

Though several of their relatives opposed the marriage, Zainab's mother and one of her brothers had consented to it, police said.

According to police, the chief suspect had arrived at the couple's house on Tuesday night with at least five other accomplices. He opened fire on Rozi, who died from a shot to the head.

The suspect then tried to shoot at Zainab, but his gun malfunctioned, leading him to attack her with sticks and a knife, leaving her injured. She is currently being treated at the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital.

The suspect, who sustained wounds after Zainab put up resistance, later went to a private hospital in Gulshan-i-Maymar with a friend and claimed his injuries were a result of a robbery incident. However, acting on a tip, the police arrested him while he was undergoing treatment.

Six people, including Zainab's nephew, have been nominated in the first information report (FIR) lodged at the Manghopir police station with Rozi's brother, Mangal Khan, as the complainant.

The primary suspect's friend who accompanied him to the hospital is also being treated as a suspect; however, he has not been nominated in the FIR.","['Imtiaz Ali', 'Silent Observer', 'Ashish Kumar', 'Nasir A.', 'Amjad Durrani Engineer Usa', 'Images Staff', 'Khurram Husain', 'F.S.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1546921,4/6/20 17:06,"Police baton-charge, arrest young doctors in Quetta during protest against lack of PPEs","Balochistan Police arrested over a dozen young doctors in Quetta on Monday while they were protesting against the unavailability of personal protective equipment (PPEs) in provincial hospitals as the war against Covid-19 intensifies.

Young Doctors Association (YDA) and paramedical staff began a demonstration from Civil Hospital and marched up to the chief minister's secretariat where they were met by baton-wielding policemen, who proceeded to baton-charge and arrest several doctors.

Talking to DawnNewsTV, YDA Balochistan President Yasir Achakzai confirmed that they had marched up to the CM's secretariat against a complete lack of protective gear for medical workers who were playing a key role in the country's fight against the novel coronavirus.

Achakzai said they were baton-charged by security forces, adding that ""dozens"" were arrested near the Red Zone. A few members of the Balochistan Assembly also reached the venue and tried to negotiate with the protesting doctors and paramedic staff.

Following the arrests, the YDA chief announced a boycott of young doctors' services from government hospitals. ""We suspend all our services following the high-handedness of police,"" Achakzai said in an emergency press conference.

Meanwhile, Quetta Deputy Inspector General of Police Razzaq Cheema confirmed the arrests of ""dozens"" of doctors but denied the use of batons against them.

""Yes, police arrested dozens of protesting doctors today,"" Cheema said. He denied the allegations that police had assaulted the protesting doctors but added that ""a scuffle broke out after the medics tried to cross barricades near the Red Zone"".

However, a video – which has been independently verified – is circulating on social media, which shows the police striking the doctors with batons and forcing them inside police vans.

""The protesting doctors have been shifted to various police stations in Quetta,"" DIG Cheema said.

The protest in Quetta comes a day after 13 doctors tested positive for Covid-19 in the provincial capital.

In a tweet, Balochistan Chief Minister Jam Kamal Khan announced that he met YDA doctors and assured them of his government's full cooperation in their battle against Covid-19 and in meeting their demands.

'State thuggery'

Soon after today's arrests, PML-N President and Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif in a tweet condemned the ""torture & arrest"" of doctors in Quetta, referring to police's actions as ""shameful behaviour"".

PPP co-chair Bilawal Bhutto Zardari also lashed out at the government for the violence against young doctors, terming the act “state thuggery”.

“Instead of providing them with the requisite protective gear, the government has sent them to jail. At a time when they are needed in hospitals, doctors have been sent to jails. What kind of justice is this?” questioned Bilawal.

He said rather than fulfilling their genuine demands, the PTI government is quashing their basic human rights.

Bilawal lamented that while doctors all around the world were being praised and supported for being on the front lines in the war against the virus, “Pakistan’s state is sending them to jails.”

Saluting the efforts of doctors in Pakistan for their services, Bilawal extended full support for Quetta’s doctors.

“The PPP is standing with you. Do not consider yourself alone,” he said in his statement.","['Ghalib Nihad', 'Syed Ali Shah', 'Dr. Usman', 'Syed H', 'Zaheer Khan', 'Desi Dimag', 'Kf Khan', 'Asif', 'A.

KARACHI, Oct 10: With the case of Rimsha Masih still grabbing the headlines, another case of blasphemy was reported to police on Wednesday, this time not in a slum but in a middle-class neighbourhood of Gulshan-i-Iqbal, after the house of the accused boy belonging to a religious minority community was ransacked and furniture was set on fire in a violent protest.

The teenage Christian boy has been accused of sending text messages containing ‘blasphemous’ content to his area residents without reading it.

The incident took place in the staff colony of the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) located at the junction of University Road and Abul Hasan Ispahani Road.

Police said that the boy was accused by the residents that he had sent text messages containing blasphemous content to the staffers and officers of the SSGC present at the residential-cum-office compound.

As the SMS reportedly circulated among the residents of the colony comprising workers and officers, they eventually attacked the residential quarter of Ryan Stanten, 16, and his mother, Rubina Bryan, on Wednesday, police said. Ms Bryan worked as a superintendent at the SSGC, they added.

The SMS had been sent on Tuesday night.

However, apparently after realising the gravity of the situation the family had abandoned the house, said a senior police officer of the area.

“Had they not left the house, the situation could have been really bad,” the officer observed.

On Wednesday, the enraged people ransacked the house and set fire to the household articles, including the bed, washing machine and fridge, after bringing them out on to the main University Road.

The protesters also raised slogans against the family.

The SMS was passed on by the accused teenager by his own cellphone on Tuesday. After receiving it, some people had gone to the boy asking him about it, he told them that he had forwarded the SMS after receiving it, said DIG (east) Shahid Hayat while speaking to Dawn.

“Ryan told complainant Khursheed Alam and Pesh Imam Qari Ghulam Qadir of the SSGC Jamia Mosque that someone sent him this SMS and he forwarded it to all Muslim friends without reading it,” said the DIG.

The official in charge of the SSGC security, an ex-serviceman, kept handling the situation, the police officer added.

After the mayhem, police reached the scene and tried to appease the protesters assuring them that police would register the case.

“We reached the scene and talked sense to some clerics who were leading the protest,” said a police officer of the area. The violent protest caused a severe traffic jam on Abul Hasan Ispahani Road and University Road.

A case (FIR No 432/2012) under Section 295-C (use of derogatory remarks, etc, in respect of the Holy Prophet) of the Pakistan Penal Code, Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act and Section 25 of the Telegraph Act was later registered at the Mobina Town police station.

A duty officer of the police station said the FIR was registered against Ryan Stanten, son of Ms Bryan, a resident of SSGC staff colony on a complaint of SSGC chief manager Khursheed Alam.

‘People scared’ Describing the trend as very dangerous, in which the Christians were also being targeted, Human Rights Commission of Pakistan chief Zohra Yousaf said that people had become very scared.

“At least 22 blasphemy cases have been reported in the country this year alone, in which Muslim accused are more in number compared to the Christians,” said the HRCP chief.

Referring to a Sept 21 incident that took place in Hyderabad, Ms Yousaf said some people had lodged a blasphemy case against a trader who had not closed his shop on the day of protest.

Earlier in August, a 14-year-old Christian girl, Rimsha Masih, had been accused of blasphemy by a cleric in a suburban neighbourhood of Islamabad. She was finally released by a court and had to be airlifted to an undisclosed location for security reasons.","['S. Raza Hassan', 'Images Staff', 'Khurram Husain', 'F.S.

MUZAFFARABAD: Indian troops opened fire across the de facto border in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, killing a soldier and a 15-year-old boy and wounding four others, Pakistan’s military and other officials said on Tuesday.

“In intense exchange of fire Sepoy Shafique fighting valiantly embraced shahadat,” said an Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) press release.

The military said Pakistani troops responded by targeting the Indian positions where the fire originated, causing substantial damage to the posts on the other side.

District administrator Qaiser Orangzeb said the boy was killed on Monday night when Indian mortar shells hit his home along the Line of Control in Kashmir.

On Tuesday, thousands of mourners attended the boy’s funeral, he said. Pakistan says India has violated a 2003 ceasefire agreement 2,000 times this year alone.

http://www.dawn.com/news/760438,10/31/12 7:29,Chinese think tank urges end to one-child policy,"“China has paid a huge political and social cost for the policy, as it has resulted in social conflict, high administrative costs and led indirectly to a long-term gender imbalance at birth,” Xinhua said, citing the report. — File Photo by Reuters

BEIJING: A Chinese government think tank is urging the country’s leaders to start phasing out its one-child policy immediately and allow two children for every family by 2015, a daring proposal to do away with the unpopular policy.

Some demographers see the timeline put forward by the China Development Research Foundation as a bold move by the body close to the central leadership. Others warn that the gradual approach, if implemented, would still be insufficient to help correct the problems that China’s strict birth limits have created.

Xie Meng, a press affairs official with the foundation, said the final version of the report wil be released “in a week or two.”

But Chinese state media have been given advance copies.

The official Xinhua News Agency said the foundation recommends a two-child policy in some provinces from this year and a nationwide two-child policy by 2015. It proposes all birth limits be dropped by 2020, Xinhua reported.

“China has paid a huge political and social cost for the policy, as it has resulted in social conflict, high administrative costs and led indirectly to a long-term gender imbalance at birth,” Xinhua said, citing the report.

But it remains unclear whether Chinese leaders are ready to take up the recommendations.

China’s National Population and Family Planning Commission had no immediate comment on the report Tuesday.

Known to many as the one-child policy, China’s actual rules are more complicated.

The government limits most urban couples to one child, and allows two children for rural families if their first-born is a girl.

There are numerous other exceptions as well, including looser rules for minority families and a two-child limit for parents who are themselves both singletons.

Cai Yong, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, said the report holds extra weight because the think tank is under the State Council, China’s Cabinet. He said he found it remarkable that state-backed demographers were willing to publicly propose such a detailed schedule and plan on how to get rid of China's birth limits.

“That tells us at least that policy change is inevitable, it's coming,” said Cai, who was not involved in the drafting of the report but knows many of the experts who were.

Cai is currently a visiting scholar at Fudan University in Shanghai. “It’s coming, but we cannot predict when exactly it will come.”

Adding to the uncertainty is a once-in-a-decade leadership transition that kicks off Nov 8 that will see a new slate of top leaders installed by next spring.

Cai said the transition could keep population reform on the back burner or changes might be rushed through to help burnish the reputations of President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao on their way out.

There has been growing speculation among Chinese media, experts and ordinary people about whether the government will soon relax the one-child policy, introduced in 1980 as a temporary measure to curb surging population growth, and allow more people to have two children.

Though the government credits the policy with preventing hundreds of millions of births and helping lift countless families out of poverty, it is reviled by many ordinary people. The strict limits have led to forced abortions and sterilizations, even though such measures are illegal. Couples who flout the rules face hefty fines, seizure of their property and loss of their jobs.

Many demographers argue that the policy has worsened the country’s aging crisis by limiting the size of the young labor pool that must support the large baby boom generation as it retires. They say it has contributed to the imbalanced sex ratio by encouraging families to abort baby girls, preferring to try for a male heir.

The government recognises those problems and has tried to address them by boosting social services for the elderly. It has also banned sex-selective abortion and rewarded rural families whose only child is a girl.

Many today also see the birth limits as outdated, a relic of the era when housing, jobs and food were provided by the state.

“It has been thirty years since our planned economy was liberalised,” commented Wang Yi, the owner of a shop that sells textiles online, under a news report on the foundation’s proposal.

“So why do we still have to plan our population?”

Though open debate about the policy has flourished in state media and on the Internet, leaders have so far expressed a desire to maintain the status quo.

President Hu said last year that China would keep its strict family planning policy to keep the birth rate low and other officials have said that no changes are expected until at least 2015.

Wang Feng, director of the Brookings-Tsinghua Center for Public Policy and an expert on China's demographics, contributed research material to the foundation’s report but has yet to see the full text.

The family searched everywhere but couldn't find Tufail, he said, adding: ""The next day we registered a First Information Report at the Prang police station.""

Nearly two months ago, the family came to know of his whereabouts when Tufail's maternal uncle in Saudi Arabia saw a picture on social media shared by an Indian social worker, Sujewa Pereira, Zafar said.

The social worker had shared a contact number beneath the photo and requested social media users to share the post so the child could be reunited with his family.

The boy's uncle dialled the given number and was told the missing boy was in the custody of the Indian police at the Ganga Nagar police station in Rajasthan.

Zafar said it had been 45 days since he learned of his child's whereabouts but had been unable to bring his son back to Pakistan. The family is now looking to the government to aid in their efforts to recover Tufail.

Tufail's parents appealed to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Indian PM Narendra Modi to help bring their son home.","['Ali Akbar', 'Ali Jee', 'Saeed Masood', 'Asif Jamil', 'The End Is Near', 'Zaman Shah', 'Adeel Saleem', 'Farrukh Iftikhar', 'Shakil Ahmed', 'Tota Ram Verma']","PESHAWAR: A seven-year-old boy who went missing from his home in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Charsadda two years ago was found in the Indian state of Rajasthan.

A bench comprising Chief Justice Mohammad Raza Khan and Justice Syed Yahya Zahid Gillani observed that in case the girl was not satisfied with the arrangement made by the jirga she could move the court again.

The court had initiated suo motu proceedings in the case after a news item appeared in a section of the press, alleging that a resident of the Mohmand Agency had abducted the 14-year-old girl, Huma, and forced her to marry him. The report said the girl now lived with her parents but her husband was pressurising her to take her back to his home.

On a court notice, the girl appeared before the bench and stated that she was kidnapped and her marriage was arranged with a person named Asif. She said she was now living with her father and did not want to return to the home of Asif.

Her father, Nisar Khan, told the court that Asif was the nephew of his wife, who had arranged the marriage. He said he was against the marriage because Asif was believed to be of bad character. He said that now a jirga was trying to resolve the issue.

PETITION FILED: An independent candidate for the seat of PF-10 in Peshawar, Mohammad Ayaz Afridi, on Wednesday challenged in the Peshawar High Court the candidature of his rival candidate of the Pakistan People’s Party, Niaz Mohammad, accusing him of possessing a fake graduation degree.

Mr Afridi filed a writ petition in the court through Advocate Saleem Shah Hoti, praying that Niaz Mohammad should be disqualified from contesting the election. He said that till disposal of the petition the respondent should be restrained from contesting the polls.

The petitioner said Niaz Mohammad had produced a graduation degree of the University of Peshawar according to which he had cleared the examinations under Roll No. 3172.

He said that after the lapse of the deadline for filing objections he had come to know that the degree was forged and, therefore, he had filed an application before the Election Commission of Pakistan which had referred it to the provincial election commissioner.

He claimed that the returning officer for the constituency, Syed Fazal Wadood, had conducted an inquiry which had proved that the degree produced by Mr Niaz was forged. However, he said, the returning officer had declined to accept his application on the ground that he had no jurisdiction. Therefore, he said, he had approached the high court.","['Bureau Report', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1377377,12/18/17 21:50,15-year-old maid allegedly assaulted by employer in Karachi,"A 15-year-old domestic helper was allegedly tortured by her employer in Bahadurabad area in Karachi where she has been working for the past one-and-a-half years, police and her father said on Monday.

The girl was working as a domestic help at the house of a local builder in Kokan Society located on Alamgir Road.

District East SSP Dr Samiullah Soomro told Dawn that police on Monday received an application by the girl’s father, through a courier service, in which he alleged that his daughter had been assaulted by the house owner.

The senior officer said that the family has not formally approached the police to get a first information report (FIR) registered, so a medical examination of the girl was yet to be done in connection with ascertaining the veracity of the allegations.

SSP Soomro said that around four months ago the house owner had moved a complaint before Bahadurabad police station, alleging that his house helper had stolen over Rs80,000 but he did not get the FIR registered.

Subsequently, both the parties agreed to ""settle"" the matter without the intervention of the police, he said, adding that parents of the girl had taken her away following the settlement.

However, on Monday, the girl’s father alleged before the media that the house owner had threatened and compelled him to sign on blank papers in the presence of police.

The girl's father said that when he brought his daughter to their home in Qayumabad her health condition started deteriorating, whereas, she, according to her father, disclosed that she was subjected to criminal assault by the house owner.

The employer also allegedly administered injections to her and the signs of administrating injections were visible on her hands, the father claimed.

The victim's father further clarified that he did not approach the police directly because he did not expect justice from them as he had already been threatened in the presence of several policemen to get the issue “settled.”

The father also alleged that his daughter, who used to get Rs8,000 monthly pay from her employer, was locked in a washroom of the house. The owner did not allow the family of the girl to meet her, he also alleged.

Bahadurabad SHO Ghanwar Ali Mahar confirmed to Dawn that he received an application from the family’s lawyer through court. He said the application doesn't contain any cell phone number to contact the family.

The SHO said the court will take up the application of the girl’s father on December 20; till then they will have to wait for the court’s orders for taking further action.","['Imtiaz Ali', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1505653,9/17/19 7:04,Police brutality,"A FEW shockingly disgraceful videos of our police force surfaced recently. In one, a police officer beats numerous women. In another, a police officer bullies and hurls abuse at a frail old woman.

I wonder what heart would not have grieved at the sight of the innocent insulted by those who are supposed to protect us from such brutality. What heart would have not been filled with antipathy for the policemen and sympathy for the victims? What heart would not have prayed that the innocent and elderly never come face to face with the police and receive such rough treatment?

The use of force against the weak and innocent is terrible enough, but against honourable elders, it is not only vile but callous. For those who dishonour the old cannot be expected to return good with good, kindness with kindness, care with care and love with love. Solon, an ancient Greek sage, once remarked that those who dishonour the old must be disenfranchised.

The behaviour captured in these videos violates the code of conduct of the Punjab police. This code of conduct, available online, states: “Officers should treat members of the public and colleagues with courtesy and respect, avoiding abusive or derogatory attitudes or behaviour.” It also says: “Every police officer shall keep his temper thoroughly under control, shall act with courtesy on all occasions and shall not allow his composure to be disturbed by the behaviour of others towards him.”

What heart would have not been filled with sympathy for the victims?

This code of conduct also draws a line clear enough as far as the misuse of authority is concerned: “No police officer may inflict, instigate or tolerate any act of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment nor any police officer may invoke superior orders, on the pretext of a threat to national security, internal political instability or any other public emergency, as a justification of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.”

Such is the code of conduct for police officers. It is quite obvious that the behaviour of some officials in the videos violates that code; their conduct is anything but decent.

The job of police officers comes with responsibility as well as authority. As a citizen, one expects that the police use their force not against the weak and innocent, but in defence of citizens from any harm they may face. The mindless use of force can only proceed from heartlessness and disregard for the law.

The video in which a frail old woman is being insulted by a police officer is particularly concerning, for the event occurred right outside the IG’s office. One would think that if there is one occasion where police officers would have to be polite, it would have to be under the watch of their highest officer. For if they are not noble near his/her office, one shudders to imagine what is going on in police offices located far from the highest seat of the force.

The police force needs an overhaul. Frequent display of brutal acts can demoralise its remaining able and noble officers. Moreover, it points to a culture of little accountability and misplaced incentives.

No great workforce is feared or respected by insulting their clients, which is the general public, in the case of the police. Instead, respect is earned by taking care of the public and protecting their honour. Vile acts, if not stopped, indicate that such behaviour is considered acceptable in the workforce. It also then appears as if rewards in such a workforce are based not on how well its members treat the public but how fast they produce results, even unreasonable ones, at the cost of due process.

When the law is often violated, demands by the populace to hold the criminals accountable in­­c­rease. Now that the use of smartphones and social media is widespread, such de­­mands increase far too quickly. This, however, cannot be an excuse to deal with suspects or others violently. Valour must be displayed whenever citizens face threats, for it is only then that honour and fame are achieved.

Banning smartphones at police stations is not the solution. Police officers should take the same view of the rights of citizens as they want their seniors to take of them. It is about time that our police force looked inward and corrected itself by improving its hiring, curriculum, and training methods. Its system of rewards, punishment and employee evaluation is also in need of an overhaul.

As a nation, we too need to do some soul-searching. For instance, it would do us well to remember that when people are not nurtured well at home and at school, they can cause trouble later. Importantly, in such times, it is not regulation and reform, as crucial as they are, that are of the most help, but the action taken by our leaders. For that action can set our course right, correcting wrongs and reviving hopes.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1520395,12/4/19 13:27,Medical board to exhume body of girl allegedly stoned to death in Dadu,"A medical board on Wednesday will exhume the body of Gul Sama, a 10-year-old girl who was allegedly stoned to death in Dadu, so that a post-mortem examination can be carried out.

The members of the board have proceeded to Wahi Pandhi area for exhumation, confirmed DIG Police Hyderabad range Naeem Shaikh today.

A four-member medical board, headed by the medical superintendent of Liaquat University Hospital city branch, was formed on Tuesday by Director General Health Services Dr Masood Solangi under judicial orders.

Following information that a girl had been stoned to death, Dadu police on Saturday arrested the parents of the 10-year-old victim and the maulvi who led her funeral prayers.

According to police, the incident occurred on the night between November 21 and 22 in the Kirthar mountain range of Dadu district, which borders the Balochistan province. Police also lodged a first information report (FIR) on the complaint of Assistant Sub Inspector (ASI) Ghulam Qadir Gopang under Sections 302, 201, 120-B of the Pakistan Penal Code.

Quoting the girl’s parents, the SSP said that the girl had died in an accident ""due to landsliding on the mountain"". The parents were living in an area called Shahi Makaan.

""Since the girl had been buried without a post-mortem examination and amidst charges of honour killing, the only way to get the body exhumed was an FIR, which was done so that the cause of her death could be determined. A post-mortem exam will certainly answer some questions,"" a senior official said.

DIG ascertaining facts

Police are still trying to find out whether a jirga was held and if it passed the order to stone the young girl to death. They are also looking into reports that the alleged jirga was chaired by the son of a Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader.

DIG Naeem Shaikh told reporters on Tuesday that it is still premature to comment on the incident as investigations are underway.

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, DIG Police Hyderabad range Naeem Shaikh and divisional commissioner Abbas Baloch met Gul's father Ali Bux Rind, who is in custody; Maulvi Mumtaz Leghari, the prayer leader who led Gul's funeral prayers and is also in custody; and the local community in Wahi Pandhi — an area in Johi taluka of the district — to verify facts of the incident.

The father insisted that his daughter died after slipping near a hilltop as a heavy stone fell on her while she was playing outside her house.

Ali Bux and his family have been living a nomadic life for a long time and shepherding livestock to make a living. He said he used to live on Khirthar mountain but shifted to Shahi Makan area a few years back.

""I don’t have a national identity card (NIC). I don’t know where I was born because my parents lived like nomads,"" he said in Brahavi, which was then translated by SHO Wahi Pandhi police station to Sindhi.

""Gul Sama was neither married nor engaged to anyone and I am not misleading [investigating officers],"" he claimed.

Ali Bux’s wife Lilan Rind told a policewoman that Gul had died after a bone in her neck broke.

According to the local prayer leader Mumtaz Leghari, he was taken to Shahi Makan area by Taj Rustamani and Sami Rind, both nominated in the FIR, from Wahi Pandhi on the evening of November 21. He said he spent a night near a graveyard, where the family brought Gul's body for funeral prayers at around 8am the next morning.

""I didn’t see the girl’s body as Rinds observed pardah as per their ritual while laying her to rest and I didn’t insist [to see her body] either,"" he said.

Her funeral, he said, was attended by around a dozen persons.

The area where the Rinds were living was around 15 kilometres away from Wahi Pandhi town — 40km away from Dadu city in Khirthar hilly terrain.

Notables of Leghari, Rustamani and Jamali communities in Wahi Pandhi also met the officers. None of them could make a categorical statement about the veracity of the incident but urged the police to take the case to its logical end if it was indeed a case of honour killing.

They said they knew the Rinds were staying in the area and have livestock holdings.","['Mohammad Hussain Khan', 'Reality Bites', 'Dr Vikas Jamwal', 'Ahsan Gul', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

Five masked men barged into the house of retired police officer Rehmat Nabi and started firing, killing his wife and daughters, aged 15 and 16.

According to police, the crime was motivated by a video clip circulated on mobile phones and showing the girls overjoyed by rain in the lawn of their bungalow.

The video, recorded six months ago, was circulated in the area four months later probably after a relative sent it to his friends.

Police believed that the girls’ stepbrother Khutore took it as an “assault on the honour of his family” and tried to “restore the family’s honour” by killing the girls.

Khutore escaped when police tried to get in touch with him for investigation. But, his four friends were arrested and, according to a senior police official, they have confessed to the crime.

Police believed that the girls’ stepbrother Khutore took it as an “assault on the honour of his family” and tried to “restore the family’s honour” by killing the girls.","['house', 'tried', 'video', 'months', 'showing', 'rain', 'girls', 'killed', 'honour', 'killing', 'family', 'mother']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189f00b83e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0d52ba8a43.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d005917e0.jpg?0.8785461548197806', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd192bbacb28.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d719e1f62.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189916390d.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2013/06/51c92377c5bb6.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0ec56aad75.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f0c8e29e4.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1b9ccb6c70.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18a3ece187.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fc7833a64a3a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1a195e7829.png?r=620371018', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1b7a7c513c.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f94d8916a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d6ce529d0.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f4142e469.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/large/2013/06/51c92377c5bb6.jpg'}",TRUE,http://i.dawn.com/large/2013/06/51c92377c5bb6.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'A family video showing two teenage girls enjoying rain in their house led to their murder in Chilas on Sunday night.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'http://beta.dawn.com/news/1020576/two-girls-mother-killed-over-family-video', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Two girls, mother killed over family video', 'description': 'A family video showing two teenage girls enjoying rain in their house led to their murder in Chilas on Sunday night.', 'image': 'http://i.dawn.com/large/2013/06/51c92377c5bb6.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'http://beta.dawn.com/news/1020576/two-girls-mother-killed-over-family-video', 'title': 'Two girls, mother killed over family video', 'description': 'A family video showing two teenage girls enjoying rain in their house led to their murder in Chilas on Sunday night.', 'image': 'http://i.dawn.com/large/2013/06/51c92377c5bb6.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2013-06-25 09:36:58', 'modified_time': '2013-06-25 09:59:01', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/391/the-newspaper-s-correspondent'}, 'author': ""The Newspaper's Correspondent""})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1334699/journalist-petitions-islamabad-high-court-after-threatening-phone-call-allegedly-from-fia,5/22/17 11:58,Journalist petitions Islamabad High Court after threatening phone call allegedly from FIA,"Journalist and World Is One News Bureau Chief Taha Siddiqui on Monday filed a writ petition in the Islamabad High Court alleging that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had harassed him over the phone.

According to the petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Siddiqui alleged that a man named Noman Bodla, who identified himself as a member of the Counter Terrorism Department of the FIA, had called him and attempted to pressure him into appearing for an 'interrogation' at the FIA headquarters.

The petition alleged that Bodla was vague about the nature of the interrogation. According to the petition, ""He did however hint that the interrogation concerned issues and opinion[s] on which the petitioner had written journalistic pieces and as such it involved the petitioner’s professional work.""

According to the petition, Siddiqui was hesitant to appear at the FIA headquarters and insisted that his ""professional work was in the public domain and could be accessed without his presence or interrogation.""

The petitioner also reportedly told Bodla that he was free to ask him any questions regarding his work over the phone.

In the petition, Siddiqui mentioned that he: ""was reluctant to go to the FIA Headquarters on the basis that there have been several reports in the press where such phone calls are made and once the person who is to be interrogated sets out to the FIA Headquarters, he is either picked up and disappeared or detained illegally.""

The petitioner further maintains that Bodla: ""insisted that it would be “better” for him to appear before Respondent No.3 (Noman Bodla) for review of his work and in a threatening voice and tone, questioned the petitioner as to whether he would appear or not in a threatening and menacing manner.""

The writ petition also alleges that, ""the petitioner has noticed that plain-clothed persons have conspicuously been pointing at his house at which the petitioner has taken due precautions,"" by restricting his own movement and letting his family and friends know his location at all times.

""It is inconceivable that the counterterrorism department of the FIA should be calling up a journalist who has nothing to do with terrorism and is a person of the pen,"" the petition said.

The petitioner has prayed to the court that the respondents in the case, Bodla, FIA and the Interior Ministry be directed to carry out their duties within the framework of the law and, ""desist from harassing citizens simply because they have expressed a view or are carrying out their professional duties.""

Recently, the FIA has identified dozens of suspects involved in what it calls an “organised” campaign against the country’s armed forces on social media, even as opposition parties condemned the alleged “misuse” of the cybercrime law by the government.

The action was ordered by Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan around a week ago after he took notice of online criticism of the armed forces.

His 'notice' followed the Army's May 10 announcement that a tweet sent out by the military's public relations wing, “rejecting” a directive issued by the Prime Minister's Office, stood withdrawn.","['Imtiaz Mahmood', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/819003/new-school-year-puts-french-on-forced-marriage-alert,9/3/09 0:00,New school year puts French on forced marriage alert,"PARIS As thousands of girls and young women prepare to start the new school year in France, activists are sounding the alarm over those who are missing - teenagers sent abroad over the holidays and forced into marriage.

Most victims are of Asian, African or Middle Eastern descent and belong to France's Muslim community, the largest in Europe.

While countries such as Britain have set up special units that track down victims at home and overseas, activists say France is only now waking up to the problem.

“For a long time this used to be considered a cultural thing,” Fatima Lalem, who is in charge of gender equality at Paris City Hall, told Reuters. “Something that happens, but that people don't look at too closely.”

Over the past year, France has begun to tackle the problem

more aggressively. Last November, Paris City Hall published a guide advising officials on detecting forced marriages.

But former victims and activists, many of them second- or third-generation immigrants working in France's multicultural suburbs, said such moves were unlikely to help women married off abroad, or scared into silence.

Zeliha Alkis, who works for Elele, a non-profit organisation that mainly helps women of Turkish origin, cites the example of a young woman of Turkish descent who was married to a Turkish man at a Paris town hall this summer. On her wedding night, she was locked in a room, and when she screamed and protested, her grandmother tied her up so the marriage could be consummated.

Wedding season

In many other cases, the women are married in the family's country of origin. Reasons include the family wanting to ensure the woman marries a candidate deemed suitable, settling a debt and procuring a visa for the groom. Unlike arranged marriage, which can be consensual, these weddings are performed against the women's will.“Early June to late September is our busiest period, after the wedding was celebrated over there, and then the young woman calls us and says, what do I do now, I don't want that husband,” said Alkis, who has received death threats from angry families.

No one knows exactly how many French women are forced into such unions. A report on women's rights by France's high council for integration in 2003 put the number of girls and women at risk of being forced into marriage at 70,000, based on research by grassroots organisations.

Christine Jamaa, head of non-profit organisation Voix de Femmes, and her team help more than 200 women a year flee forced marriages or escape before the wedding.

Since more than half of them are under the age of 20 and at school or college, Jamaa is asking the government to set up an early warning system for those who disappear over the holidays.

“There are those who don't come back from the summer holidays and sometimes the schools only react in October, even in February,” Jamaa told Reuters at her office north of Paris.

France has at times steered an awkward course between trying to respect its ethnic minorities and defending women's rights; last year, a French court annulled the marriage of a Muslim woman on the grounds that she lied about being a virgin.

Similarly, some see forced marriage as a religious issue, even though Islam bans it and imams helping the women have been threatened.

In the families' countries of origin, forced marriage tends to be illegal and less widespread than in migrant communities.

For now, activists rely on friends, siblings, teachers or the victims themselves to alert them. Sympathetic French consulates abroad may then intervene to delay a husband's visa.

One such consulate assisted the escape of Fatou Diouf, a 28-year-old Muslim woman of Senegalese descent.

She was lured abroad at the age of 18 - her father told her he had won a trip to Senegal and gave her the ticket. When she arrived, she was told she had already been married off to her 36-year-old uncle in a religious ceremony that did not require the spouses to be present.

After seven months in confinement, she fled with the help of a local who put her in touch with the French consulate. Now, she works for a women's organisation, Femmes Solidaires, in a tiny office in the shadow of grimy tower blocks south of Paris.

“There are more and more girls who are speaking out,” she told Reuters. “But exercising the right to say no automatically means cutting the ties with the family.”—Reuters","['Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1563542,6/15/20 6:42,Violence grips US again as police kill another black man,"WASHINGTON: “We are done dying,” declared the National Associ­ation for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) as violence re-erupted across America on Sunday over death of yet another African-American man, this time by police shooting.

Rayshard Brooks, 27, was shot dead by police on Friday night outside a Wendy’s outlet in Atlanta, Georgia, after he was found sleeping in the restaurant’s drive-through area.

“We do not have the full right to live in this country,” said NAACP, one of the largest civil rights groups in America, while urging people to join its campaign against racism. “Business as usual may cost us our livelihoods and our lives.”

Civil rights activists are trying to change social attitudes in America, particularly towards the African-American community. The movement gained momentum late last month when a policeman choked George Floyd to death in Minneapolis as dozens watched and filmed the incident.

The police cruelty stunned the American nation, causing countrywide protests that were the most intense in Minneapolis and in the nation’s capital, Washington. Tens of thousands of whites joined the protest, although Floyd was an African-American.

But appeals for peace, and the fear of a resurgence of Covid-19, eased the tensions until this weekend when Brooks’ death re-ignited the fire. The backlash started with a video that showed Brooks resisting arrest and then running away from two police officers after snatching a taser.

One of the officers chased Brooks and fired several shots into him after he turned the device, which is used to stun a detainee, towards the officer.

A crowd gathered outside the restaurant on Saturday and set it on fire, as an estimated 1,000 protesters watched it burning. Protesters then walked to a nearby highway, stopping traffic.

They locked arms, chanting “black lives matter” and “I can’t breathe,” slogans popularised during the protest against Floyd’s killing.

“I can’t breathe,” were Floyd’s last words and of another African-American, Eric Garner, who died in police custody in Staten Island, New York, in July 2014. He repeated the words 11 times before he died.

These words have now become an international rallying cry against racism as people across the globe continue to express solidarity with the protesters in the United States.

In Atlanta, police made several attempts to disperse the crowd and made dozens of arrests, but the demonstrations continued till Sunday morning. A small group emerged later and set the Wendy’s on fire again. Others spread out to various neighbourhoods.

As the unrest continued, the Atlanta Police Department fired officer Garrett Rolfe, who shot Brooks, and placed his partner, Devin Bronsan, on administrative duty.

Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced that police chief Erika Shields had also resigned. “I do not believe that this was a justified use of deadly force,” she said.

“Business as usual may cost us our livelihoods and our lives.”Civil rights activists are trying to change social attitudes in America, particularly towards the African-American community.
But appeals for peace, and the fear of a resurgence of Covid-19, eased the tensions until this weekend when Brooks’ death re-ignited the fire.
A crowd gathered outside the restaurant on Saturday and set it on fire, as an estimated 1,000 protesters watched it burning.
They locked arms, chanting “black lives matter” and “I can’t breathe,” slogans popularised during the protest against Floyd’s killing.","['man', 'washington', 'brooks', 'kill', 'atlanta', 'grips', 'violence', 'watched', 'words', 'death', 'wendys', 'africanamerican', 'protesters', 'black', 'america']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/06/5ee6ca223bda9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd29e77ecee6.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2eaf72ea17.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f0c543fe8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/06/5edc55b336901.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e4d6d7c0e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/06/5edc55b336901.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2efebbe9a2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/06/5ee6055a5d0aa.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/06/5ee6055a5d0aa.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/06/5ee6ca223bda9.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/06/5ee6ca223bda9.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Rayshard Brooks was shot dead by police outside a Wendy’s outlet in Atlanta after he was found sleeping in the restaurant’s drive-through area.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1563542', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Violence grips US again as police kill another black man', 'description': 'Rayshard Brooks was shot dead by police outside a Wendy’s outlet in Atlanta after he was found sleeping in the restaurant’s drive-through area.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/06/5ee6ca223bda9.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1563542', 'creator': 'Anwardawn', 'title': 'Violence grips US again as police kill another black man', 'description': 'Rayshard Brooks was shot dead by police outside a Wendy’s outlet in Atlanta after he was found sleeping in the restaurant’s drive-through area.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/06/5ee6ca223bda9.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-06-15 06:42:41', 'modified_time': '2020-06-15 08:00:43', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/153/anwar-iqbal'}, 'author': 'Anwar Iqbal'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1201129,8/18/15 6:02,Kasur child abuse scandal ‘not organised crime’,"ISLAMABAD: At least 16 suspects, including the alleged mastermind of the child pornography ring at the heart of the Kasur child abuse scandal, have been arrested. But on Monday, the officer responsible for the investigation into the scandal told the Senate Standing Committee on Human Rights that the incident should not be treated as “organised crime” because those involved were youngsters, all in their mid-20s.

In addition, the committee also summoned the Sindh chief secretary and the Rangers Sindh director-general to address complaints regarding extrajudicial killings during the Karachi operation.

The child abuse scandal came to light last month, with media reports claiming that around 400 videos of 280 victims were made by the gang in Husain Khanwala, Kasur.

However, briefing the committee, Sheikhupura Regional Police Officer (RPO) Shehzad Sultan disagreed with those figures and said that only 30 video clips were available on police record.

“Initially, only eight cases were reported. But on Aug 13, another 10 victims filed applications, bringing the total number of victims to 18,” he said. He also confirmed that a woman from the area had also filed an application alleging that she had been raped by the suspects in question.

“Of the 16 suspects, 12 have been formally charged and police have obtained their physical remand. We are trying to secure the remand of the four remaining suspects as well,” he said.

“The mastermind — who confessed to the crime — is 25 years old, which suggests that he became involved with this while he was still a teenager; therefore it should not be considered an organised crime. The suspects are all young friends and demanded small payouts, such as mobile phone credit and easyload,” he said.

When asked by Senator Farhatullah Babar why the police remained unaware of such a heinous crime for over six years, the RPO said that since the crime centred around a social taboo, most victims did not tell their parents, and parents who were aware about the abuse did not inform the police for fear of losing face.

“Moreover, the police is usually busy with security arrangements and countering terrorist attacks such as the one in Attock, so such crimes are not a priority,” he said.

PML-N lawmaker Nisar Mohammad, who was chairing the committee meeting in the absence of MQM’s Nasreen Jalil, said that the police should focus on rooting out such crimes to ensure law and order.

“It is responsibility of intelligence agencies to stop terrorism. We have been embarrassed at the national and international level by this incident,” he said, adding that there may well be more victims because the 280 figure had been circulating for quite some time.

The RPO said that a joint investigation team had been formed and that victims were being provided free transport to come and record their statements. At the suggestion of Senator Samina Abid, committee members decided to visit the village in question and instructed the police to keep the members informed about progress in the investigation.

Karachi operation: During discussion on the Karachi operation, members decided to summon the Sindh chief secretary and the Rangers DG to address concerns regarding extrajudicial killings.

After agenda items were completed, Senator Babar said there was a need to evolve a mechanism to monitor the Karachi operation and address the complaints regarding extrajudicial killings.

Balochistan National Party-Mengal Senator Dr Jehanzeb Jamaldini was of the view that extrajudicial killings cannot be tolerated because if the state partook in such action, political parties would also follow suit.

“There are complaints of extrajudicial killings from all over the country so the issue should be addressed,” he said.

However, the acting chairman of the committee seemed reluctant to give any direct recommendations.

Senator Babar proposed a draft for the ruling of the committee, but Senator Samina Abid said that the operation had reduced the crime rate and incidents of target-killing had also declined. Then, Senator Babar read out another draft for the ruling, which praised the operation but said that extrajudicial killings should be stopped.

The chairman, however, after consulting with the members, decided to summon the Rangers DG and the Sindh chief secretary to the next committee meeting to discuss the issue.

“Committee Chairperson Nasreen Jalil may also be present during the next meeting so it would be better to take a collective decision,” he said.

Sharmeen echoed the sentiments of the premier, and said “Islam discourages violence against women, and there is no honour in honour killings.”

The prime minister reiterated that there should be no discrimination on the basis of creed, colour or caste in the Pakistani society.

“It is the government’s priority to ensure women rights, and the government will take administrative measures against honour killings,” elaborated the premier.

Speaking at the special screening arranged for the prime minister, Sharmeen further stated that no religion allows to kill women in the name of honour.

“Islam entitles women with fundamental rights, and the government should be committed to plug loopholes in legislation, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has assured us that measures would be taken against honour killings,” said Sharmeen.

The announcement of the screening at PM House came after the Oscar-winning documentary maker met PM Nawaz at his official residence earlier.

PM Nawaz Sharif had stated honour killing was a critical issue and voiced his government’s determination to eradicate this practice from society.

Such customs and practices, he had said, had nothing to do with Islam.

A Girl in the River, which is a joint production of Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy (SOC) Films and Home Box Office (HBO), follows the life of an 18-year-old girl who is a survivor of an honour killing attempt.

Chinoy, who won Pakistan’s first Academy Award for her documentary ‘Saving Face’ at the 84th Annual Academy Awards in 2012, thanked the PM for supporting her endeavours to end honour killings in the country and revive a progressive image of Pakistan.","['Irfan Haider', 'Agha Ata', 'Khan- Pakistani', 'Law Of Cause', 'Altaf Abdullatif', 'Philosopher', 'Japan', 'Ghulam Nabi Malik', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman']","“It is the government’s priority to ensure women rights, and the government will take administrative measures against honour killings,” elaborated the premier.

PM Nawaz Sharif had stated honour killing was a critical issue and voiced his government’s determination to eradicate this practice from society.","['documentary', 'nawaz', 'sharmeen', 'girl', 'rights', 'minister', 'govt', 'sharif', 'measures', 'killings', 'women', 'honour', 'prime']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2016/01/569c67b9e0ab9.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/02/56cbe1a8b3f66.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2015/06/556bade4bcfc6.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/large/2016/02/56cbe1a8b3f66.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3016e58145.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/01/569c67b9e0ab9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd300912aa88.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/02/56cb1f2a4033f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd302d7b34e9.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2016/01/569c669d03ff4.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/01/569c669d03ff4.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e0fc3a04b.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2015/06/556bade4bcfc6.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg'}",TRUE,http://i.dawn.com/large/2016/02/56cbe1a8b3f66.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': ""Sharmeen Obaid's documentary against honour killing screened at PM House, Nawaz commits to tackle honour killings."", 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'http://www.dawn.com/news/1241185', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Govt to take measures against honour killings, says PM Nawaz', 'description': ""Sharmeen Obaid's documentary against honour killing screened at PM House, Nawaz commits to tackle honour killings."", 'image': 'http://i.dawn.com/large/2016/02/56cb1f2a4033f.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'http://www.dawn.com/news/1241185', 'title': 'Govt to take measures against honour killings, says PM Nawaz', 'description': ""Sharmeen Obaid's documentary against honour killing screened at PM House, Nawaz commits to tackle honour killings."", 'image': 'http://i.dawn.com/large/2016/02/56cb1f2a4033f.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2016-02-22 17:23:55', 'modified_time': '2016-02-22 19:54:04', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/2652/irfan-haider'}, 'author': 'Irfan Haider'})",['https://player.vimeo.com/video/153547504'],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1548550,4/12/20 7:01,Forced conversions,"OVER the years, the laws applicable to the rights of religious minorities in Pakistan have shifted from being neutral to blatantly discriminatory — from electoral laws, family laws, law on evidence, Hudood laws, redistribution of income through Zakat and Ushr, trust and evacuee property laws, domicile and nationality, to offences against religion.

The discrimination against women belonging to religious minority groups is worse; they become victims of rape, abduction, forced marriage and forced conversion. That it is largely underage girls who are ‘converting’ to Islam speaks volumes of the vulnerability of the converts, and the motivation of those behind the conversion.

Twice the Sindh government attempted to outlaw forced conversions and marriages, including laying guidelines for the court process in the Protection of Minorities Bill, placing an age limit of 18 years upon conversions and enabling better due process. In 2016, the bill was unanimously passed by the Sindh Assembly, but religious parties objected to an age limit for conversions, and threatened to besiege the assembly if the bill received approval of the governor, who then refused to sign the bill into law.

In 2019, a revised version was introduced, but religious parties protested once again. A sit-in was organised by Pir Mian Abdul Khaliq (Mian Mithu), a political and religious leader and a central character in many cases of forced conversions of underage Hindu girls in Sindh. He and his group claim the girls are not forced, but fall in love with Muslim men and convert willingly. In March 2019, nearly 2,000 Hindus staged a sit-in to demand justice for two sisters, Reena and Raveena, who they claimed were forcibly converted and married. The Islamabad High Court ruled the girls had willingly converted and married the men. Herein lies the contention. While there are a large number of cases of forced conversions and marriages, there are also cases where vulnerable young women are preyed upon by influential men who entice them to convert and marry. To what extent can the law differentiate coercion from peaceful persuasion, and could enticement without the threat of violence become punishable?

It is largely underage girls who are ‘converting’.

Pakistan is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states that the right to freedom of religion includes the right to change one’s religion and that no one shall be subject to coercion to change their religion. The European Court of Human Rights has given some guidance regarding the distinction between permissible religious persuasion, on the one hand, and coercion on the other.

According to case law, exploiting a position of power to entice vulnerable people or subordinates to convert amounts to coercion, which should be outlawed. The fact that the default legal system in Pakistan is discriminatory, particularly towards women from religious minorities, coupled with the clout and resources of those preying upon them, implies coercion and urgently requires positive legislation to safeguard vulnerable citizens.

Further, once the women convert, there is no going back, as apostasy would mean a death sentence. In many cases, women are also told that their families are ‘kafirs’ and they cannot meet them. This impedes their access to justice as they remain in the clutches of powerful men. No one hears from these women directly after they ‘elope’. Reena and Raveena’s parents are right to question why they suddenly decided to marry men who already had wives and children.

The Peoples Commission for Minorities’ Rights and the Centre for Social Justice compiled the data of 156 incidents of forced conversions which took place between 2013 and 2019. A vast majority of the girls are minors, with numerous cases of girls as young as 12 years old. Religious groups oppose a minimum age for conversion or marriage on the basis that this is not sanctioned by Islam. Since Sindh has outlawed the marriage of girls under 18, underage girls are taken to Punjab in some cases, where they are married.

Sexual intercourse with a girl below the age of 16 is statutory rape and carries a death sentence, or a minimum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment. There is no defence. Yet in some cases, the production of a conversion certificate and a nikahnama influences law enforcement to pardon the abductors.

Pakistan has failed to comply with its international obligations to protect non-Muslim women and girls from exploitation by powerful groups and criminal elements. Even worse is the psychological impact on families of minorities who worry when their daughters venture out, and the culture of intolerance that is promoted when leaders like Mian Mithu celebrate another ‘conversion’ and marriage as a victory for the Muslim faith in the local community. It sends a chilling message to our most vulnerable people — that their girls are not safe.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1516820,11/15/19 7:02,Our ‘hidden’ shame,"THE recent arrest of a known paedophile, Sohail Ayaz, has raised serious questions about the government’s handling of child sexual abuse cases.

Ayaz had previously been convicted and sentenced to prison in the UK for child sexual offences, and then, reportedly, deported by Italy for his links to a child pornography ring. Unfortunately, this was not flagged by the authorities here, and he was able to secure a working contract with a KP government department under a foreign-funded project.

If it hadn’t been for the mother of his latest alleged victim, there would have been no stopping his sickening activities. She approached the police in Rawalpindi when her son disappeared for four days. Police said that Ayaz has admitted to raping at least 30 children in Pakistan alone.

The incident reflects the extent of the unspoken social embargo on the subject of child sexual abuse in the country. As many as 1,300 cases of child sexual abuse have been recorded only in the first six months of this year, according to the NGO Sahil. Yet, the reported cases are only the tip of the iceberg as countless parents shy away from registering police cases.

It is astonishing that Ayaz was caught after allegedly raping 30 children; had none of the parents of the victims come forward to report the crime to the authorities and demand stern action? This also shows the parents’ lack of trust in the law-enforcement authorities that have a track record of victim shaming and mishandling cases of this nature.

Who can forget the comment of a police officer in Shahzad Town, Islamabad, who told the family of a missing 10-year-old girl in May that she might have eloped? When the police did spring into action later, after widespread condemnation, it was discovered that the suspect had been booked in two similar cases.

Meanwhile, the Chunian case suspect was found to have been nearly arrested twice before. Then there was the notorious serial rapist and killer Imran Ali in Kasur city, who was caught only after protests erupted when the body of little Zainab was found in a garbage dump. Four years after the child pornography ring was busted, the victims — almost 300 victims — from Hussain Khanwala village in Kasur district still await justice.

We as a society continue to fail our children. We will keep doing so until we open up and acknowledge the depth of the malaise within.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1570011/woman-allegedly-abducted-raped,7/20/20 7:08,"Woman allegedly abducted, raped","RAWALPINDI: A young woman was allegedly abducted from Gulraiz Colony and raped by two people.

The victim’s father told the Airport police that two of his daughters were on their way to a seminary on Thursday when they were intercepted by two people in a car, who abducted his elder daughter.

He said his daughter was released by the kidnappers on Saturday.

When she returned home, she told her family that she was taken to an undisclosed location, confined there and raped by two people.

The victim was taken to a hospital by the police, after which an FIR was registered against the suspects, but they have yet to be arrested.

Separately, after three months the police on Sunday arrested a man who raped a woman and extorted her by blackmailing her with videos.

The victim’s husband, who lives in the Naseerabad police area, lodged an FIR with the police saying that his sister’s husband - who lives nearby - visited his home in his absence two and a half months ago and raped his wife at gunpoint and filmed her.

He said that because of the social stigma, the victim did not tell anyone what had happened while her alleged attacker blackmailed her and extorted Rs90,000 from her.

He added that in addition to extorting money, the alleged rapist came to their home and took rice and other edibles valued at Rs24,000 that the complainant used to earn his livelihood.

The complainant said the suspect continued to blackmail his wife and took her gold earrings, valued at Rs45,000.

A police spokesperson said the suspect will be produced in court for remand custody.

PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly on Tuesday passed a law declaring the custom of ghag an offence punishable with up to seven years imprisonment or Rs500,000 fine or both.

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Elimination of Custom of Ghag Bill 2012 was passed unanimously to eradicate the social evil called ghag. The bill was tabled by Provincial Minister for Social Welfare and Women Development Sitara Ayaz.

The law defines ghag as “A custom, usage, tradition or practice whereby a person forcibly demands or claims the hand of a woman, without her own or her parents’ or wali’s will and free consent, by making an open declaration either by words spoken or written or by visible representation or by an imputation, innuendo, or insinuation, directly or indirectly, in a locality or before public in general that the woman shall stand engaged to him or any other particular man and that no other man shall make a marriage proposal to her or marry her, threatening her parents and other relatives to refrain from giving her hand in marriage to any other person, and shall also include obstructing the marriage of such woman in any other manner pursuant to such declaration.”Ms Ayaz withdrew her amendments concerning increase in imprisonment from seven to 14 years for perpetrators of ghag when law minister Arshed Abdullah requested her to do so.

Preamble of the law states “Whereas the constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan provides that the dignity of man, and subject to law, privacy of home, shall be inviolable and the state shall protect the marriage and the family”.

It further said that the Shariah gave right to women to enter into valid marriage with their free consent and the constitution of Pakistan enjoined upon the state to promote social justice and eradicate social evils.

The offence under this act will be cognizable, non-bailable and non-compoundable.

MPA Noor Sehar withdrew her proposed amendments because those were identical to that of Ms Ayaz.

The question of Ms Sehar concerning returning of $15.7 million unutilised loan, provided by Asian Development Bank for investing in technical education sector, was approved for discussion in the house. Minister for technical education Mehmood Zaib couldn’t satisfy the mover and other MPAs who had asked supplementary questions regarding this issue.

Several movers expressed anguish over the absence of ministers concerned.

Criticizing the absent ministers, MPA Kifayatullah asked Speaker Kiramatullah Chagharmatti to publish advertisements of “missing ministers” as several ministers avoided coming to attend the assembly proceedings.

Answering the question of Ms Sehar, the labour department informed the house in a written reply that under Employment of Children Act, 1991, around 554 cases had been registered for violation of child labour in last four years.

The lawmakers criticised the labour department for poor performance, as the violation of child labour had become very common and could be seen on street level.

On this, the law minister said that the labour department had not established its setup on district level and that was why accurate monitoring of child labour was not possible. He urged the elected representatives to keep check on child labour in their respective constituencies and inform the department if they found any violation of the law.","['Mohammad Ashfaq', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/695486/five-female-foetuses-found-in-manzoor-colony,2/14/12 20:04,Five female foetuses found in Manzoor Colony,"KARACHI, Feb 14: Five female foetuses — two in jars and three in plastic bags — were on Tuesday found in a Manzoor Colony garbage dump within the remit of the Mehmoodabad police station.

While the police surgeon believed that the foetuses might have been preserved as specimens for study purposes in a medical college or a biological laboratory before being disposed of. The recovery stirred debate among doctors about medical ethics and current abortion practices in the country.

The foetuses, aged between five and nine months, were found in the garbage dump near a storm drain.

The police spotted the jars and the plastic bags in Street 11 of Sector-E and called the rescue service to shift the foetuses to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for an examination, said Mehmoodabad SHO Rao Muqeem. “Their examination has revealed that they had been preserved in formalin for a considerable period of time,” said Police Surgeon Dr Hamid Pariyar while speaking to Dawn.

He added they smelt as if they had been kept in formalin for quite some time, suggesting that they might have been preserved in a medical college or a biological laboratory before being dumped.

He said that one of the foetuses was nearly nine months old while the other four were younger. “All of them were female foetuses.”

They weighed 300 grams, 314gms, 325gms, 365gms and 392gms, hospital sources said.

Special Secretary Health Dr Suresh Kumar said that accurate time of their death (or abortion) could not be ascertained due to the fixation of internal and external tissues by formalin. “Probably they had been preserved for teaching purposes,” he observed.

Dr Shershah Syed, a senior obstetrician, was of the opinion that midwives generally did not dispose of foetuses in such a manner if they had carried out abortions at some private clinic.

He said although he had not seen the foetuses, there was a strong possibility that a laboratory might have been cleaned up and foetuses kept in the jar might have been discarded in the garbage dump.

“However, it can be ascertained if traces of formalin are found on the foetuses,” Dr Syed maintained.

A handout issued by the office of the health minister stated that a committee had been constituted to inquire into the circumstances under which the five foetuses were found in a garbage dump in Manzoor Colony. The committee would be headed by Dr Kumar, it said.

According to a senior official of the Edhi Foundation, Anver Kazmi, about four years back, six foetuses in jars were found along Massan Road in Keamari.

Debate on medical ethics The recovery of the five foetuses stirred debate among medical professionals, with some senior doctors pointing out that the job of a medical professional is not to get judgmental on patient’s actions but to save a life.

The incident needed to be thoroughly investigated and there was a dire need to create public awareness on the issue of abortion, the doctors said.

“Abortion is a sensitive issue and people must avoid jumping to conclusions in the absence of complete details. The media, too, must not sensationalise the matter since we don’t know the conditions which forced a woman or women to abort the pregnancy and the circumstances in which the procedure was carried out,” said Dr Syed, who is currently heading the Pakistan National Forum on Women’s Health.

It could be a case of improper disposal of clinical waste or termination of pregnancy by unqualified medical practitioners whereas the patient could be a rape victim, he added.

Dr Syed also called for a DNA test of all the foetuses to determine whether they belonged to the same woman.

“Given that the foetuses weighed only between 300gms and 400gms it was very possible that they were all conceived by a single woman,” said Dr Nighat Shah, who represents the Society for Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Pakistan.

She said the foetuses could be between 18 and 20 weeks.

“Multiple pregnancies are usually the result of fertility treatment, but the incidence of five pregnancies even in such cases is uncommon. In these circumstances, doctors have no choice but to abort the pregnancies considering there is little chance of the babies’ survival.

“The staff that carried out the procedure might have thought that the foetuses were too small and threw them in the garbage dump. But, ethically speaking, it’s wrong. Once body parts are formed, respect must be given and the foetuses should have been buried,” she said.

Legal status Commenting on the legal status of abortion, Dr Shah said that the foetus attained the right to life only when it started breathing independently.

“Abortion is allowed legally and religiously under certain conditions, but most doctors think otherwise compelling a large number of women, largely poor, to seek treatment from unqualified staff,” she said.

Subsequently, they end up having lots of medical complications, or even die, she added.

“Maternal life is important and if qualified doctors discourage women from seeking abortion, they will naturally seek help from quacks,” she said, while calling for spreading awareness about modern family planning methods and making them accessible to the people.

According to estimates, about 890,000 induced abortions are carried out every year in the country and the procedure — contrary to the general perception that it is sought by unmarried women — is wanted by married women, with four to five children, who consider abortion an ‘easier family planning tool’ rather than using contraceptives.

According to official statistics, about 276 women die per 100,000 live births on account of pregnancy-related complications in Pakistan. Of them, 13 per cent of women die of abortion-related complications.","['Dawn Report', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

Legal status Commenting on the legal status of abortion, Dr Shah said that the foetus attained the right to life only when it started breathing independently.","['doctors', 'medical', 'female', 'garbage', 'dr', 'manzoor', 'foetuses', 'preserved', 'abortion', 'syed', 'women', 'colony', 'formalin']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd329902b790.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30f9aa72ea.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30f2a2ab64.jpg?r=1024215937', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg', 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}",TRUE,http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'KARACHI, Feb 14: Five female foetuses — two in jars and three in plastic bags — were on Tuesday found in a Manzoor Colony garbage dump within the remit of the Mehmoodabad police station.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/2012/02/14/five-female-foetuses-found-in-manzoor-colony/', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Five female foetuses found in Manzoor Colony', 'description': 'KARACHI, Feb 14: Five female foetuses — two in jars and three in plastic bags — were on Tuesday found in a Manzoor Colony garbage dump within the remit of the Mehmoodabad police station.', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/2012/02/14/five-female-foetuses-found-in-manzoor-colony/', 'title': 'Five female foetuses found in Manzoor Colony', 'description': 'KARACHI, Feb 14: Five female foetuses — two in jars and three in plastic bags — were on Tuesday found in a Manzoor Colony garbage dump within the remit of the Mehmoodabad police station.', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2012-02-14 20:04:17', 'modified_time': '2012-02-14 20:04:17', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/203/dawn-report'}, 'author': 'Dawn Report'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1110925,6/6/14 6:27,Ulema council’s fatwa declares honour killing un-Islamic,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Ulema Council (PUC) has declared in unambiguous terms that murder of women or girls in the name of ‘honour’ is un-Islamic.

The PUC issued a fatwa on Thursday which said such killings were generally devoid of any legal or Islamic justification. “These murders are akin to spreading mischief on Earth.”

The decree was issued by the PUC’s Darul Iftaa.

Hafiz Mohammad Tahir Ashrafi, the chairman of the PUC, presented a draft of the decree at a national conference here. The event was attended by diplomats, religious scholars and representatives of minority communities.

Hafiz Ashrafi said the murders were usually committed due to suspicion and the killers usually didn’t have any witness to support their allegations.

The fatwa was issued on the basis that those killed were generally unmarried girls. “Unmarried girls cannot be murdered even if allegations against them are proven to be correct and there are witnesses against them,” the PUC chairman said.

APP adds: A joint declaration adopted at the conference expressed sorrow over incidents of sectarian violence and attacks on places of worship of non-Muslims.

Addressing the conference, the Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, Mohammad Yousuf, urged ulema and the representatives of minority communities to forge a consensus on promoting tolerance in society.

Referring to reports about incidents of forced conversion in Sindh, the minister said such practices were prohibited in Islam.

The participants of the conference urged the government to grant legal status to a proposed code of conduct and make sure that it was implemented.

Following are the main points of the proposed code of conduct:

— Terrorism committed in the name of Islam is a violation of Islam, and the leadership of all religions and sects declare their dissociation from such acts.

— No prayer leader, cleric or speaker will debase or induce his followers to debase any prophets, companions, family members or wives of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH); the four caliphs and Imam Mehdi in his speech or sermon.

— No Muslim sect will be declared non-Muslim and no Muslim or non-Muslim will be declared worthy of being killed.

— Apart from Azan and Arabic sermon, the use of loudspeakers will be completely banned.

— Publication and distribution of offensive and hateful books, literature and pamphlets will be stopped and there will be a complete ban on cassettes and online websites containing objectionable and hateful material.

SIX years after Hafiz Saeed Rehman went missing from Sariab Road Quetta, the police dug up a grave to look for him. The High Court ordered that a body be exhumed because Quetta police, after giving half a dozen other explanations for his disappearance, had started saying that Hafiz Saeed had been killed. His father Allah Bakhsh Bangulzai who has been campaigning for his son’s release for nine years, didn’t believe the police. “I knew it wasn’t his grave, I knew my son wasn’t dead,” insists Allah Bakhsh, who runs a small grocery store near his house. Allah Baksh Bangulzai’s faith wasn’t just the faith of a father who can’t bring himself to believe that his eldest son might be dead. He had seen with his own eyes the body that was buried in that grave. Nine year earlier looking for his newly disappeared son Allah Baksh had done the rounds of the mortuaries. “They showed me two bodies,” says Allah Baksh. He had a really good look. “They were both my son’s age. One boy had his throat slit. Another one had his legs cut off just below his knees. I was relieved neither of them was my son.”

Hafiz Saeed became one of almost 1300 disappeared Baloch citizens whose families have been holding almost a perpetual vigil for their release. They travel from distant villages and towns to hold three-month-long protest camps outside Islamabad and Karachi Press Club but our press usually ignores them. When Voice of Missing Baloch Persons recently held a rally to mark one thousand days of their protest, no TV channels covered it.

After his visit to the local morgue, Allah Baksh was convinced that his son was alive. For next six years Allah Baksh’s son kept making fleeting appearances in various reports, official documents and court hearings. Once it was admitted in Balochistan High Court that he was in the custody of our intelligence organisations. Once he was told that his son had been sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment because he was a terrorist. Then the high court was told that he was doing his time in Gujranwala jail. But after six years of running up down the country and knocking at every one’s door Allah Baksh stood besides a grave waiting for a body to be exhumed, certain in his heart that it wouldn’t be his son.

Hafiz Saeed left his home on the evening of July 4, 2003. It was a Friday and there had been a huge bomb blast in the area. Forty people died in that blast and soon after a curfew was imposed. “He came home after his maghreb prayers, got on his bicycle and left,” remembers Allah Baksh. He repeats the same details over and over again as if he has missed something and if he can remember the exact sequence of events, he’ll find out where his son is right now. “There was a curfew in our part of the city, the curfew started at 6pm and Hafiz left home at 6.15.” Six years of searching his memory and he still has no answer why his son left home just after the curfew came into effect. “May be he thought if you are on a bicycle nobody will bother you. May be he didn’t know that a curfew has been imposed. I don’t know what he was thinking.”

Hafiz Saeed was 25 when he disappeared. He was an obedient and bright son. He had done his Hifz-i-Quran by the age of 15. He went on to do his matric privately. He was teaching other children Hifz-i-Quran at Iqra School. He was the eldest in the family and was engaged to be married a year after he disappeared.

With his madressha background, his teaching job, his beard and his shalwar above his ankle, a lot of people, specially the security forces, tend to jump to the conclusion that Hafiz must have been somehow involved with some religious cult, some jihadi organisation. “He never did any of those things. After finishing his teaching work at school, he came straight to my shop in Gharib Abad and helped me out. He had cousins who were also madressah teachers. Sometimes they visited. I never heard anything political. He was very pious, yes, but he was a straight boy. He was the eldest of my children, he was close to me. I would have known.”

Hafiz Saeed didn’t return home that night. “My son had never not spent a night at home. I got worried. I started looking.”

Hafiz Saeed and his family had no personal enmity. His father assumed that Saeed had been picked up by the law-enforcing agencies for violating the curfew. He thought about kidnapping for ransom but told himself that who would expect a ransom from someone as poor as him. He registered an FIR, did the rounds of the hospitals and asked everyone he could.

“Fifteen days later a man came looking for me,” says Allah Baksh. “He came on a motorbike, introduced himelf as Yasin from MI.” Yasin from MI asked Allah Baksh if his son Hafiz Saeed was involved with any Jihadi organisation. “I told him that he wasn’t involved with anyone or anything except his teaching and my shop.” The man on the motorbike assured Allah Baksh that MI will investigate and if he was with any of the law-enforcing agencies, he’ll be released.” For next three months Allah Baksh kept looking but didn’t hear anything from anywhere. He filed a petition in the high court. The petition has been going on for eight years, now, but not once has he seen a glimpse of his son despite various orders by the court saying that a meeting should be arranged between the missing person and his family. He has not had any kind of contact with his son during this time.

In the intial hearing a statement submitted on behalf of the ISI said that Hafiz Saeed had been arrested after he was injured in the bomb blast and he was being interrogated. Crime Branch also confirmed in a separate report that Hafiz Saeed was in the custody of ‘sensitive agencies’. The high court instructed that a meeting be arranged with the family. The meeting never happened. Instead Crime Branch submitted another report, this time saying that Hafiz Saeed wasn’t in the custody of ‘sensitive agencies’.

Allah Baksh wrote letters to President, to Chief Justice but never heard back. For 11 months he sat in a protest camp outside Quetta Press Club. For all these years there was no sighting, no news of his son but he didn’t give up.

Then out of the blue a list surfaced in Quetta High Court in 2009. There were 13 missing people on it. They were all supposed to be serving time in jails. Hafiz Saeed was on it. According to the list he had been court martialled and sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment. The report said that he was in Gujranwala jail.

Allah Baksh managed to contact HRCP who sent one of its people to Gujranwala jail. The jail authorities said they didn’t have Hafiz Saeed. Allah Bakhsh went back to the high court and this time police filed a submission that Hafiz Saeed had actually been killed in that blast and buried.

By now Hafiz Saeed had been suspected of being involved in the blast, suspected of being injured in the blast, and now six years later his family was being told that Hafiz Saeed had actually died in the blast. Allah Baksh reminded the court that his son had left home four hours after the blast happened. High court ordered a DNA test. Police were basically saying that one of the bodies that they had shown Allah Baksh six years ago was his son’s. “I had had a good look at those bodies,” Allah Baksh again gives a graphic description of the slit throat and decapitated legs. “That wasn’t my son.”

Before they exhumed the body that wasn’t his son’s, they gave him some clothes and asked if he recognised them. “These clothes didn’t belong to my son. After he became a Hafiz-i-Quran he never wore a shirt with buttons. But just to make sure I took these clothes to show his mother. And she also said that these were not his clothes.”

The body was exhumed and as Allah Baksh had predicted it wasn’t his son. He was relieved. But not for long. He says that secretly he envies people who have found the bodies of their loved-ones. “They have buried them and now they mourn them,” he says. “All I can do is wait.”

And while he waits, Allah Baksh can’t stop thinking of the events of that fateful evening. “What I don’t understand is that he came home after offering his maghrib prayers. There had already been a bomb blast. Then he took his bicycle and went out. There was curfew outside. I don’t know why he went out.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1470609,3/19/19 20:57,Snow leopard mauls 8-year-old boy to death in Galiyat,"Listed as a vulnerable species globally, a snow leopard mauled a minor boy to death in Galiyat region of Abbottabad district, it emerged on Tuesday.

Eight-year-old Sufiyan, a resident of Chanati village in Namli Mira was playing outside his home on Monday when he was attacked by the leopard, a police source told Dawn.

The child's mutilated body was recovered late night from a nearby ravine, locals said. His funeral prayers were held in the afternoon today and were attended by a large number of people.

Read: Saving the elusive snow leopard

Sardar Muhammad Iqbal, a local resident while talking to reporters demanded that the wildlife department should monitor the movement of snow leopards in the area to prevent loss of human lives.

He noted that because the region had received an unprecedented amount of snowfall this winter, the big cat family had come down to the thickly populated areas of Galiyat where they were damaging the residents' properties and causing harm to the public and their animals.

Iqbal said cameras should be installed in the area to monitor the snow leopards' movements for the protection of lives of schoolgoing children and women.

Wildlife experts have expressed concern over an alarming decline in the population of snow leopards in Pakistan, citing climate change, lack of eco-friendly tourism and habitat degradation caused by increasing human activities as the leading factors behind threats to the species.

There are only 11 countries in the world other than Pakistan where snow leopards are found.

At present, between 4,500 and 7,500 snow leopards exist across the world and in Pakistan, according to previous estimates, between 320 and 400 snow leopards were found in the Karakoram, Himalayas and Hindukush mountain ranges.","['Rashid Javed', 'Gordon D.

According to the report released at the Lahore Press Club on Thursday, the data from January to June in 2019 reveals that 729 girls and 575 boys became victims of sexual exploitation. The cases under major categories included 378 of abduction, 139 of rape, 153 of sodomy, 46 of gang rape, 88 of gang sodomy whereas 12 boys and four girls have been murdered after sexual abuse.

In 2018, there were 3,307 such incidents reported to police, 39 cases were not reported and 56 cases were not registered. Around 430 cases were reported by newspapers with incomplete information.

In Lahore only, there were 50 incidents reported last year while nine children had been abducted and 12 reported missing from January to June 2019. January to June data gave grim numbers as it included five incidents of rape, seven of sodomy, three of gang rape and five of gang sodomy.

Ansar Sajjad Bhatti, the senior regional coordinator of Sahil, said there were other incidents in which three boys and as many girls were murdered after gang rape, sodomy and rape, 186 children were found missing from their homes while there were 40 cases of early child marriage and one case of Vani.

The most common perpetrator of the child sex abuse was an acquaintance with the victim and the victim’s family. Out of a total of 1,304 cases, 614 cases were such where the abusers had acquaintance with victims or victim’s family. In all, 142 cases were reported in which strangers were involved in abusing children.

Most victims (414) were between 11 and 15 years old, followed by 5 to 10 years old (171 cases), and 16 to 18 years old (117 cases). The youngest age group one to five years old had the least number of cases (75). In 401 cases, the age of victims was not mentioned in newspapers.

In total, 203 children have been abused in their own places, 300 at an acquaintance’s place, four in a haveli, 12 in a madrassa, three at their workplace and 162 in open places, including fields, streets and forests. Punjab had the most cases of sexual abuse (652), followed by Sindh (458), Federal (90), KP (51), Balochistan (32), AJK (18) and GB (3).

Mr Bhatti said Sahil’s recommendations included an awareness campaign for protection of children from child abuse, introduction of a new legislation and a guarantee of implementation of enforced enactments, as well as a comprehensive rehabilitation/support system for the victims. He said messages of self-protection should be included in the school curriculum while a provincial plan of action against child sexual abuse and exploitation must be drafted by the government.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1263763,6/9/16 14:06,Hurried funeral for Lahore 'honour killing' victim,"LAHORE: An 18-year-old girl murdered by her mother for marrying the man of her choice was discreetly buried before dawn Thursday by her in-laws, as activists and politicians condemned Pakistan's latest gruesome honour killing.

Zeenat Bibi was set on fire Wednesday in a low-income neighbourhood of Lahore. None of her relatives sought to claim her body, police said Thursday, leaving her new husband's family to bury her charred remains in the dark in a graveyard near the city.

“There was a peace and calm in the area during the funeral prayer and burial,” the officer in charge of the local police station Sheikh Hammad Akhtar told AFP.

Akhtar said the husband, 20-year-old Hasan Khan, had launched a complaint in the killing against his bride's mother, Perveen Bibi, who is in police custody.

The victim's family told AFP how Perveen ran into the street after the murder and began beating her chest, shouting: “People! I have killed my daughter for misbehaving and giving our family a bad name.”

Hundreds of women are killed in Pakistan each year for so-called “honour”, but it is rare to hear of such atrocities being carried out by women.

Khan said on TV that the couple had eloped, but he had reluctantly allowed Zeenat to return to her family home after they promised they would hold a celebration and not harm her.

Police have also detained one of Perveen's sons-in-law, and are searching for another of her sons. Investigators said they were still awaiting the official results from a post-mortem report.

Rights activists condemned the killing Thursday as Senator Sherry Rehman called for the federal government to detail the steps it was taking to prevent such violence.

“Women continue to face violence in the most atrocious form despite the prevalence of legislation against such acts,” Rehman told the Senate Thursday.

That a family could turn against their own child “shows that there something flawed in law and society”, said Hina Gilani, a human rights activist in Lahore.

“Anybody, whether father, mother, can do it because they have the satisfaction that they can get away with it,” she said.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif vowed to eradicate the “evil” of honour killings after a documentary highlighting the issue won an Oscar in February, but no fresh legislation has been tabled since then.

Last week 19-year-old Maria Sadaqat was tortured then burned alive for refusing a marriage proposal from a school principal's son in Murree.

The premier welcomed Facebook's investments and programmes in Pakistan and urged the company to increase their footprint, Radio Pakistan reported.

He also recognised the potential of digital platforms and the role they can play in providing global opportunities to the country's youth and entrepreneurs. The premier also noted how such opportunities can lift people out of poverty, the report said.

PM Imran raised concerns about the global rise in hate and extremism and acknowledged the immense challenge of fighting hate speech online.

The pair also discussed Facebook's connectivity investments and research grants awarded this year to Pakistan-based academics. Other topics touched upon during the meeting included Facebook's feature for donating blood, which has seen more than five million people sign up since it launched in-country, as well as the company's support for a polio-free Pakistan.

PM Imran and Sandberg also spoke about the latter's SheMeansBusiness programme, which is providing training to 6,700 women across the country.

The last time the pair met was in January during a meeting held at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.

The premier had invited tech firms to invest in Pakistan, and had asked Facebook to consider investments to support Pakistani incubators and help in digital literacy initiatives. At the time, Sandberg had invited the prime minister to visit Facebook's headquarters.","['Outsider Perspective', 'Nausheen Khan', 'Haider Shaikh', 'Something Haute', 'Ghulam Murtaza Khan', 'Dr. Salaria', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Bharat', 'Lahori Kid', 'Zia Uddin']","Prime Minister Imran Khan and Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg held a virtual meeting on Friday to discuss the social media giant's investments in Pakistan, its support for digital literacy initiatives and its work concerning Covid-19.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1515863,11/10/19 6:57,THE STRANGE CASE OF THE SILENT WOMEN,"In conversations surrounding the 'forced conversions' of Hindu girls, the voices of the girls are missing

‘Forced conversions’ of young girls is an emotive issue within the Hindu community of Sindh. Those accused claim that ‘young love’ is being misrepresented by the community, the media and activists. But those who know the whole truth are often not speaking...

Last year Hari Lal’s house in Daharki, a city in Ghotki district, was echoing with the sound of laughter and the cranky fights of his daughters Reena and Raveena on the eve of Diwali. Diyas illuminated the small courtyard where the sisters had drawn intricate rangoli patterns, after carefully choosing each colour. But this year, Diwali at the Lal home is devoid of colour. In March, Lal maintains, his daughters were kidnapped during the festival of Holi.

“Today our day started with crying,” Lal tells Eos. The 50-year-old cannot help but remember Reena and Raveena on every special occasion.

Lal had made headlines earlier this year when a video of him — helplessly slapping himself while crying outside the Ghotki police station, asking the police to do something to recover his daughters — went viral online. Lal was not alone. Reportedly over 2,000 Hindu men and women from nearby villages and towns had joined him in demanding justice for Reena and Raveena, blocking the highway for three consecutive days.

The incident became a flashpoint about the issue of forced conversion of Hindu girls. Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal-Bhutto Zardari met with Lal and his son Shaman Das, and assured them that all efforts would be made for the recovery of the girls. Prime Minister Imran Khan took notice of the incident. Even Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj directed the Indian high commissioner in Islamabad to send her a report about the incident.

“In the past 200 years, not a single Hindu has been converted to Islam forcibly,” Mian Mithu claims. “All those men, women, girls and boys, whether they belong to the Hindu community or any other community, come to us to change their religion out of their own choice,” he says.

But it was all for nothing. In April, the Islamabad High Court found that the sisters from Ghotki were not forcibly converted to Islam. A medical test showed that Lal’s claims that Reena and Raveena were minors were also incorrect.

Some now use the ruling as an example of how the issue of forced conversions of Hindu girls in Sindh is blown out of proportion.

But Lal refuses to accept that his daughters married the two Muslim men, Safdar Ali and Barkat Ali — both of whom were already married with kids — out of their free will. His son, Shaman Das, alleges that the strings of what happened to his sisters were being pulled by the pir of the shrine Bharchundi Sharif, Mian Abdul Haq, more commonly known as Mian Mithu.

Mian Mithu, a former PPP member of the National Assembly, is infamous for his involvement in cases of alleged forced conversions. In 2015, when Imran Khan asked Mian Mithu to join Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), the PTI chairman faced so much backlash from the Hindu community that he had to distance himself from the pir. The PPP had earlier denied Mian Mithu a ticket when he first came under the spotlight in 2012 because of accusations of forcefully converting a Hindu girl, Rinkle Kumari. The conversion, Mian Mithu had claimed, was not forced.

The religious leader found himself in the news yet again in September this year. He made headlines when he reportedly led a large number of people who took to the streets in protest to an alleged incident of blasphemy. In a rare move, Mian Mithu recently called a press conference in Karachi, clearly in an attempt to clear his name.

THE MIAN MITHU SHOW

Mian Abdul Haq alias Mian Mithu

The Karachi Press Club is bustling with energy on a Tuesday. Reporters chatter away before the man of the hour, Mian Mithu, takes his seat facing the audience. He looks calm. He is wearing his signature cone-shaped white cap and a grey kameez. His white beard and calm demeanour give the impression of someone who is very sure of himself. Joining Mian Mithu is his 30-something son, Abdul Malik, and another associate.

“I have nothing to do with the Ghotki violence. In fact, my sons and nephews tried to control the mob, which was charged over an incident of blasphemy committed by a Hindu school principal,” Mian Mithu says.

He and his followers had nothing to do with the vandalism of the Sacho Satram Das temple, he maintains. Instead, he insists, some organisations are trying to defame him.

But Mian Mithu is not just here to talk about the recent riots in Ghotki. He wants to address another accusation against him that keeps resurfacing: forced conversions of Hindu girls.

“In the past 200 years, not a single Hindu has been converted to Islam forcibly,” he claims. “All those men, women, girls and boys, whether they belong to the Hindu community or any other community, come to us to change their religion out of their own choice,” he claims. “They are not forced to convert.”

Going back to the case of Rinkle Kumari, he proudly shares that Faryal Bibi (the Muslim name of Rinkle Kumari) has recently completed reading the Quran and has returned to Pakistan after performing Umrah. She currently teaches the Quran to children at the madressah, he says.

Mian Mithu clearly wants to position himself as a saviour of love. He says that he supports newly converted Muslims, even Hindu women who are entering the religion after falling in love with a Muslim man. This is something Mian Mithu has apparently been doing for years.

According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), in 2018, more than 13 Hindu girls were abducted and married off to Muslims without the consent of their families. But members of the Hindu community say the number is higher.

Back in 2013, when he was a local member of the national assembly, he had invited the press to his residence on the outskirts of Daharki. Reporters and photographers had travelled from Karachi to see Kiran Kumari, another young woman who had supposedly fallen in love and eloped with a Muslim boy.

Kiran had narrated her and Shabbir Ahmed’s love story in great detail. She told the captivated audience of journalists that she and Ahmed had come to Mian Mithu’s residence a day before Eidul Fitr, where she embraced Islam and married the love of her life. Mian Mithu had told the media that he gives shelter to eloping couples because it is his “duty” to provide them security.

Six years later, Mian Mithu repeats the same lines at the Karachi Press Club. “There is no force in religion, but there is also no bar on helping those in need,” he declares.

“Once non-Muslim converts, the first thing that they need is shelter and a source of livelihood,” he says. “Yes, I support those who are in need, but they convert out of their own free will,” he says, at the crowded news conference at the press club.

FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD

Away from the cameras and prying journalists, 18-year-old Radha* walks on a narrow pathway passing through green fields. She is waving a small stick in her hands. She looks like any other young woman in her village in Umerkot district. Radha is wearing a colourful choli and gharara and her arms are full of white bangles. Suddenly, she stops and points to the fields where her life changed forever. “There,” she says, pointing the stick in her hand to the exact spot where she was playing when she was kidnapped by a man named Ali Nawaz, when she was 16.

“He kidnapped me from the fields in the evening and took me to some house,” she says. It was at this house that the teenage girl was raped multiple times.

Radha’s father Vinesh* petitioned the Sindh High Court against the kidnapping of his daughter. He had found out that his daughter was being kept in a village near the Sarhandi shrine, in Mirpurkhas division. Soon the court-ordered Nawaz and four of his accomplices to produce the girl in court.

The men did their best to intimidate Radha.

“They said that I have to tell the judge that I have changed my religion and married Ali Nawaz out of my own free will,” she recalls. They also warned her that they would kill her parents if she did not comply.

But, in court, Radha told the judge the truth, that Ali Nawaz had kidnapped her and had been raping her for three months. “When the judge asked who I want to live with, I said my parents,” Radha recalls the traumatic ordeal, her voice shaking as she speaks.

Members of the Hindu community in the area insist that this is not an isolated case.

According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), in 2018, more than 13 Hindu girls were abducted and married off to Muslims without the consent of their families. But members of the Hindu community say the number is higher.

Finding reliable data on the matter is difficult. Like the Reena and Raveena case, many cases that are initially reported as cases of forced conversion are later deemed love marriages. But the community refuses to buy this explanation. They believe that there is something more insidious at play here.

THE THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE

A screengrab from a viral video of Reena and Raveena saying that they have voluntarily accepted Islam

Ameet Kumar is a social rights activist and mukhiya (chief) of the local Hindu community in Daharki. “When a mother gives birth to a daughter in our community, we feel fear,” he tells us, as we sit for tea at a dhaba.

“It’s become a nightmare to live in these circumstances,” he says, adding that many Hindu families have stopped sending their daughters to school out of fear of abduction and kidnappings.

Dewan Lal, a member of the Hindu community, says these fears are not unfounded. The thin and tall man claims that every other Hindu here can narrate a similar story of abduction, conversion and forced marriage involving someone related to them. It allegedly happened with his own niece, 18-year-old Simran.

Simran, a high school student, had gone to the Mol Mata Mandir with her mother in May this year. “This is where she disappeared from,” Dewan Lal tells Eos.

“Once a girl is raped, she is blackmailed into giving whatever statement they want recorded in the court,” he says, supposedly speaking from his own experience of handling dozens of such cases. He questions why it is Hindu girls alone who are so eager to change their religion and elope. Why aren’t Hindu boys, who enjoy more social independence than the girls, doing the same?

As in the case of Reena and Raveena, the community staged protests for the recovery of Simran, this time outside the Sukkur Press Club.

Much like Reena and Raveena, a week later, Simran could also be seen in a viral video clip, saying that she had changed her religion without any coercion and had married her husband Afaq out of her own free will.

Like Reena and Raveena’s family, Simran’s uncle, Dewan Lal, claims that Mian Mithu was behind the conversion.

“After the court allowed Simran to go with her husband, Mian Mithu’s son, Mian Aslam, along with some of his men, visited the girl’s house,” he says. “They told us that Simran had married and converted her faith of her own will, and firmly asked us to let them live together now.”

Simran’s parents were apprehensive. They feared that like many girls of the area who ‘marry Muslim men out of love’, their daughter would not be allowed to leave her house, study or meet her family. When the parents expressed their concerns in the Sindh High Court, the court’s circuit bench in Sukkur passed a unique order. The two-judges directed the groom, Afaq, to ensure that Simran meets her parents and family members every three months. The judges also directed the man to allow his new bride to pursue her studies or do a job, if she chooses to.

Mian Mithu’s followers point to cases like that of Simran’s to rubbish the Hindu community’s claims that their women (and girls) are being forcefully converted. They claim that these women choose their future partners and, obviously, in order to marry a Muslim man, they have to embrace Islam.

The more well-off members of the community in the city make voluntary contributions to arrange food for the animals. Hindus, Makheja says, consider cows sacred because their Lord Krishna would cherish the butter stolen from the neighbours in his childhood. We walk and talk as Makheja takes us on a tour of the under-construction Krishna Temple on the gao shalla’s premises.

Makheja is the mukhiya of Sukkur’s Hindu community, some of whom has lived in the region since before Partition. He is also president of the Hindu Panchayat Council’s chapter for upper Sindh — where Hindus contribute significantly to the economy through businesses, trade, exports and farming.

The well-respected community member says that debunked cases of forced conversion should not be taken at face value. The most sensitive issue, Mukheja says, is rape.

“Once a girl is raped, she is blackmailed into giving whatever statement they want recorded in the court,” he says, supposedly speaking from his own experience of handling dozens of such cases.

He questions why it is Hindu girls alone who are so eager to change their religion and elope. Why aren’t Hindu boys, who enjoy more social independence than the girls, doing the same?

Makheja, who himself comes from a wealthy upper-caste Hindu family, says that the most unfortunate thing is that their community is being pushed around and cornered despite the fact that they have lived in Sindh for generations.

“These spiritual leaders’ devotees first earn the trust of Hindu girls, and then motivate them to change their religion in some cases,” he alleges. “In other instances, the devotees kidnap the girls with the support of their pirs. Since the converted girls are not allowed to meet their families, we do not know what becomes of them,” he says.

“The situation prevailing in the province towards the Hindus is just a glimpse of the hostility towards our community,” he says. “The problem should be identified at the state level. But, unfortunately, nothing is being done on the part of the state.”

The Sindh government did, however, get involved and tried to work towards a solution.

To control the growing incidents of alleged abductions of Hindu girls, their forced conversions and marriages below the legally fixed adult age of 18 years, the PPP-led Sindh government passed a law to criminalise such acts in 2014. The Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act sets the legal minimum age of marriage for boys and girls at 18 years. Religious groups had opposed the new law, which finally came into force following amendments to certain sections.

However, community leaders say that the new law in Sindh is being bypassed, as converted girls are being shifted to Punjab to register their marriages and conversions, because the legally fixed minimum age for marriage is 16 years in Punjab.

“Raveena and Reena were shifted to Rahim Yar Khan district in Punjab… This is the new trick to play with the law,” Eshwar Lal says. (Hari Lal, Reena and Raveena’s father, had claimed that his daughters were 14 and 16 when they were ‘abducted’. Case proceedings presided over by Chief Justice Islamabad High Court Athar Minallah had later found that the women aged 18 and 19 are adults.)

Activists and members of the Hindu community do not think that this act alone is enough. In 2016 the Sindh Assembly had unanimously passed a bill against forced conversions. But this was not signed into law due to pressure by some religious quarters.

Asad Iqbal Butt, HRCP’s vice-chairperson for the Sindh chapter, says that a very sophisticated and organised campaign is behind forced conversions of Hindu girls by religious leaders.

“These spiritual leaders’ devotees first earn the trust of Hindu girls, and then motivate them to change their religion in some cases,” he alleges. “In other instances, the devotees kidnap the girls with the support of their pirs. Since the converted girls are not allowed to meet their families, we do not know what becomes of them,” he says.

Human rights groups have been voicing their concerns over the situation in the province for a while.

“In a majority of the cases, the girls say that they want to live with their husbands, so the judges allow them to go with their husbands,” says Zahida Detho, an activist closely working with the minority community. But she says, in many cases, the girls give these statements because they face threats at the hands of their kidnappers, who have warned them that they will cause harm to their family members unless they comply.

“The actual story unfolds when a kidnapped girl returns to her family, which is very rare,” says Detho.

Radha’s was such a rare case. Her father Vinesh had clearly mentioned in his plaint that his daughter’s kidnappers were being protected by the influential village pir Ayub Jan Sarhandi — known for having converted hundreds of Hindus, mostly women.

THE PIR OF THARPARKAR

Sarhandi’s residence is located around 20 kilometres off the Umerkot road, where he also runs a madressah for boys. Members of the Hindu community and human rights activists in the Mirpurkhas division claim that Sarhandi uses force and his influence to suppress Hindus living in Tharparkar.

On a sunny morning, Sarhandi is sitting in his courtyard, wearing a crisp white cotton shalwar kameeez and matching headgear. He occasionally strokes his long grey beard as he carefully listens to the allegations against him. He raises his eyebrows from time to time, but does not interrupt us or lose his temper.

He takes a moment before responding. We can hear young boys reciting the Quran in the madressah.

Finally, Sarhandi responds to our questions about the community’s accusations of him patronising forced conversions of underage Hindu girls and marrying them off to Muslim men after they have abducted the girls and sexually assaulted them.

“It is all propaganda by the NGOs [non-governmental organisations] that are agents of India’s spy agency RAW [Research and Analysis Wing] and Western donors that want to defame Pakistan,” the cleric says.

He says that the claim that they only convert Hindu women is utterly false. He signals a young devotee to bring a logbook in which he and his men have recorded each conversion.

One would expect Sarhandi to be perturbed by the laundry list of heinous acts he is accused of committing. Instead, the pir manages to maintain a sense of humour during the interview. He opens the logbook. “This is Bheero Kohli,” he says. “A relative of the Indian cricketer Virat Kohli,” he jokes. He then continues to point out names of Hindu men who have come to him to embrace Islam.

Sarhandi vehemently opposes the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act that criminalises marriages of underage children. “There is no age religiously determined to embrace Islam,” he says. “Similarly, no age limit was fixed for the marriage of women.”

Sarhandi believes that people like him are the real victims and the media continues to misrepresent them, running “one-sided” stories. “Please [publish] my complete version,” he requests, giving us a knowing smile.

But men like Sarhandi and Mian Mithu routinely find themselves surrounded by journalists, taking notes and photographs as they speak. Their views on the topic of alleged forced conversions are extensively documented. As are those of representatives of the Hindu community, parents of the girls who have been allegedly abducted and human rights activists who are demanding change. The missing voices are those of the girls.

Girls like Reena, Raveena and Simran are only seen speaking in carefully curated short videos that are circulated online. Pirs like Mian Mithu speak on behalf of women like Faryal Bibi. Even in a rare case like Radha’s, where a girl has returned home after defiantly speaking her mind, she is mostly confined to her home after marriage to a Hindu man. Everyone seems to have something to say about alleged forced conversions of Sindh’s Hindu girls, except the girls themselves.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1538537,3/5/20 7:03,On harassment,"IN recent years, ‘harassment’ has become an integral part of our popular vocabulary. It is now discussed in mainstream media — albeit often not with the nuance and sensitivity it deserves — and fiercely debated in both private and public spaces. It is hard to imagine that, unlike other types of sexual and gender-based violence, harassment is a relatively new concept, both as a legal category and in the public imagination.

Developed as a legal concept in the 1970s by scholar Catherine MacKinnon, harassment was conceived as a form of sexual discrimination. Laws on harassment were a triumph of second-wave feminism and its engagement with legal instruments as it reifies social inequalities and forces the law to acknowledge societal power structures.

While all subjects are equal under the eyes of the law, progressive laws such as those on harassment force the neutral language of the law to acknowledge that society is, in fact, unequal and this understanding needs to be taken into account. Workplace harassment, for instance, acknowledges that workplaces are unequal and hierarchal, thus the ability of those in positions of power to harass, intimidate and silence subordinates is quite likely. This, coupled with the oppressions and structures of subordination inherent in patriarchal societies, makes women more vulnerable to harassment.

It felt like a dam had burst.

In Pakistan, the movement behind the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, is an example of successful advocacy. The Alliance Against Sexual Harassment brought together women from all walks of life, and male allies, to work on the issue of workplace harassment. It is one of several gains made by the Pakistani feminist movement and its engagement with the law. The act makes it mandatory to have inquiry committees in each workplace and ombudspersons at the provincial and federal level.

Recently, however, the efficacy of the law has been called into question. While it has become a cliché to trace a shift from the #MeToo moment, it is not inaccurate to say that the issue of harassment exploded in the public consciousness in the past three years. Testimonies of women across the world, including Pakistan, were thrust into the public discourse. It felt like a dam had burst. Suddenly, our newsfeeds were littered with the trauma of women who had been violated and silenced.

While the #MeToo era has made leaps and bounds in terms of public awareness, the movement has been noticeably absent in its engagement with the law and its accompanying justice system. Many young feminists are either disillusioned with the law or view it as an obstacle rather than a tool for engagement. In the process of this disengagement, the inadequacies of the law have been laid bare.

Glaringly, the law on workplace harassment takes a very narrow approach to defining gender, sticking to binaries of men and women to the exclusion of trans individuals whose bodies are often the site of this very violence. Additionally, the provision in the Pakistan Penal Code on Harassment (Section 509) only applies to women. These gender binaries reified in the law can lead to structural exclusions for those not given legal recognition, rendering the violence they experience as invisible.

Secondly, feminist approaches to legal theory posit that laws need to take into account the lived experience of marginalised communities, and thus any law that places the burden of proof on women to prove their harassment ignores the realities of the discrimination or violence they experience. It is extremely difficult to provide cogent evidence in these cases because harassment often rarely leaves behind a neat paper trail and usually takes place when the victim is most vulnerable and isolated.

This question of standards of evidence often takes place in frantic tones and hyperbolic warnings, where weary men warn of floodgates of false testimonies as if women are lining up to pursue false cases in a system that already marginalises them. In fact, we need to have important discussions that dismantle the patriarchal legal constructs such as the ‘reasonable man standard’. Judges and lawyers need to develop precedents that place the lived experience of women at the centre and speak to the ‘reasonable woman standard’ that incorporates the positionality of women, and the intersectionalities that define their lives, when adjudicating a case.

As women across Pakistan take to the streets this Sunday to mark International Working Women’s Day, it is important to listen to experiences of the women who are marching — each of them carrying a placard that has a story of harassment. The demands of the various Aurat Marches include safer workplaces and public spaces, where harassment is not merely an inevitability. Join them on March 8. Imagine what a safer, more just and equitable society could look like, one in which all of us are free from discrimination and violence.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1504979,9/13/19 13:04,Police torture: A product of Pakistan's authoritarian political values?,"It may very well be the case.

About a decade ago, in March 2010, newspapers thronged with articles on police torture following an incident in Chiniot in which suspects accused of street crimes were stripped, tortured and publicly humiliated by policemen outside a police station.

The videos of the incident led to public outcry. A suo motu notice was taken. The Supreme Court ordered the Punjab government to ""shut down private torture cells being run by the police, make drastic changes in police training manuals, maintain strict discipline and hold senior police officers, including inspector general, accountable.""

The media reported that some 150 torture cells were being run in Lahore by the Punjab Police, outside the premises of police stations, where policemen were usually employing five methods of torture: physical, hygienic, deprivation, psychological and humiliation.

The police felt targeted, embarrassed and demoralised. The then Inspector General of Punjab Police said the public was ""abusing [the police] more than the Indian army."" The Supreme Court instructed the Inspector, ""tell your police force not to obey illegal or unconstitutional orders.""

Senior police officers told other police officers to follow ""scientific methods"" of interrogation. The low-ranked policemen involved, including the Station House Officer, were arrested. The Deputy Superintendent of Police was suspended.

Sounds familiar? It should. The more things change…

A year later, in August 2011, two young brothers were lynched to death in the presence of police officers in Sialkot. A few months later, reports of a torture cell within Crime Investigation Agency headquarters in Lahore (the Kotwali Office) made the rounds.

In 2018, a young boy was sexually assaulted inside a private torture cell near Lahore, while one police official video recorded the assault. In the first week of September of this year alone, we have learned about the tragic deaths of Salahuddin Ahmed, Amjad Ali and Amir Masih.

Related: Police torture is rife. When will the state legislate against it?

Last year, Advocate Javeria Younes presented her research on custodial torture in Pakistan. She surveyed lawyers, social activists, members of law enforcement agencies and torture victims in five major cities across Pakistan.

She found that in addition to torture being used as an instrument to extract evidence, it is also ""encouraged and abetted by the state to maintain its writ"", explaining why police officers and the public alike complain that there is a lack of political will to reform police departments and improve the culture of civilian policing.

Based on the records of Madadgaar Helpline, Younes found that between 2009 and 2013, there had been a dramatic increase in the incidents of torture of both men and women. In 2008, Madadgaar Helpline had published its own findings based on reported incidents of police torture across Pakistan between January and June. It found that in those six months, 743 cases of police torture had been reported, predominantly from Punjab (406) with Sindh being the second worse (304).

A comparison of provincial capitals showed 177 cases of police torture reported in Lahore in this period, against 45 in Karachi. In the cases studied, ‘torture’ included a variety of techniques ranging from murder to rape, illegal detention, physical torture and harassment.

Today, a handful of legal frameworks safeguard civilians from torture in police custody. The Pakistan Penal Code prohibits causing ‘hurt’ for extracting confessions (but does not use the word ‘torture’). Article 14(2) of the Constitution prohibits torture in custody and states, ""No person shall be subjected to torture for the purpose of extracting evidence."" Article 10 of the Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention. Section 176 of the Criminal Procedure Code demands a magisterial inquiry in cases of custodial deaths, but as is common knowledge, such inquiries seldom take place.

Despite these provisions, as Sarah Belal, executive director of the Justice Project Pakistan, has stressed, torture needs to be criminalised and outlawed. A bill criminalising torture was tabled in the National Assembly in 2014 but has yet to be passed into law. (The proposed Torture, Custodial Death and Custodial Rape (Prevention and Punishment) Act 2015 was cleared by the Senate in 2015).

Symbols of law and ‘terror’?

When focusing on police torture, it is customary now to start by acknowledging its colonial roots. In 1855, the Madras Torture Commission produced a 400-page document that showed how revenue authorities had been misusing their powers of policing and brutally extracting revenue from the poor. But even after the Torture Commission had carried out inquiry and subsequent reform committees highlighted this issue, police abuse remained rampant.

In her study on torture under colonial rule in India, Anupama Rao analysed how allegations of torture against the colonial regime and police were side stepped when responsibility was transferred to pre-colonial regimes and torture was seen as a legacy of ""'native' practices of punishment.""

There is similarly a tendency in Pakistan to distance police administrators and their political masters from allegations of police misconduct, by transferring blame onto colonial laws and continuities and not the current politics of policing that thrive on the institutional weaknesses of our police organisations.

Read next: What the Sahiwal shooting tells us about police culture

Given that we have been independent for over seven decades, we must ask: are colonial policies, practices and laws perhaps suiting our political actors, its civil and military establishments, and serving their interests? What else explains such blatant lack of will towards institutional reform, inconsistencies in the application of existing laws and utter disregard for procedural justice?

The prevalence of police use of excessive and lethal force continues to raise these and many other questions. In the 1990s, then interior minister, General (retired) Naseerullah Babar, propagated and popularised the idea of ""fighting terror with terror."" This statement reflected not only Babar’s military background, but it also foregrounded the idea of police terror that was present both before and after Pakistan’s independence, and capitalised on it.

In 1973, an opinion in an English-language daily had criticised the ""custodians of law and order, namely, the police… [for] contributing their share in spreading terror among the people."" In 1984, I. A. Rehman wrote,

""Our police know only one method of investigation. Investigation more often than not means extraction of confession under physical pressure. True, the law does not accept confessions obtained under duress. Still the practice continues because the police officers know that once a confession, however secured, is substantiated with evidence uncovered by the accused, the latter will be much too concerned with the risk of conviction to complain of violence inflicted on him.""

Thirty five years and a generation of police officers later, informal and extralegal procedures and practices remain unchanged, and the philosophy of fighting terror with terror has become institutionalised. In the 90s’ operations in Karachi, both the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) and the Sindh Police were known for utilising lethal techniques for gutting out information from individuals in their confinement.

It was through the reports of the Crime Investigation Agency’s torture cells, established for political victimisation, that the practice of cheera entered into public conscience as a method used by select police officials to cause excruciating pain to the detained suspect by pulling his legs apart and stretching them in opposite directions, suddenly or gradually.

On its part, the MQM had similarly established its torture centres to mirror the practices of the police and inflict excessive violence on those accused of spying on behalf of the police and intelligence agencies, escalating a vicious cycle of torture and terror that was symbolised in the bori band laash.

This human rights crisis in Karachi, a product of torture, deaths in custody, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings of political opponents designated as ‘terrorists’ has continued in the ongoing Karachi Operation since 2013, legitimised through narratives of counterterrorism and partly legalised through frameworks such as the Protection of Pakistan Act, 2014 and the amendments to the 1997 Anti-Terrorism Act.

Over the years, news reports and investigations by journalists have provided in-depth insights into torture and killings in police custody and illegal detentions. In 2010, in the aftermath of the incident in Chiniot, one journalist quoted a deputy superintendent of the Punjab Police as claiming,

""Punishments in public create fear of the police among the public, and believe me 80 per cent of the crime is controlled in this way… The low-ranked police officials who are 'famous' for using third degree means are very popular among the high officials and many of them are deputed as investigation officers to control crimes and criminals.""

Also popular are police officials who can be patronised by politicians for carrying out politically motivated violence. Accounts of torture detail not just the perpetration of violence on the part of police officials, but have also exposed the nexus between crime, politics and policing.

In recent history, this has been evidenced in Karachi in the case of the Lyari gang war, where gang leaders, themselves patronised by political parties, were able to select which police officials would be posted at the police stations within Lyari. This selection could then determine which police officials would be complicit in the torture and even murder of rival gang members.

Dawn Investigations: Rao Anwar and the killing fields of Karachi

The killing of Arshad Pappu is a case in point. In 2013, acting on the behest of Uzair Baloch and the People’s Amn Committee, three police inspectors abducted Baloch’s rival Pappu and delivered him to the former. Pappu’s brutal murder and beheading was video recorded and widely circulated. Although the inspectors were arrested, the buck stopped there when it should have passed on to the scapegoaters complicit in police use of lethal force.

In 2015, a serving senior officer of the Sindh Police publicly distinguished between the half fry and full fry, a formula used to symbolise methods of police use of excessive and lethal force. Half fry referred to the torture of suspects in police custody, while full fry referred to their extrajudicial killings. In a statement, the officer said,

""Extrajudicial killings and other actions cannot be justified officially but society has come to accept this 'modus operandi' of police to eradicate crimes and make streets safer... You can see police have restored peace and order in the city through this modus operandi.""

This statement echoes the multitude of claims made during this operation in Karachi as well as those of the 90s. What it also reflects is the belief held by certain police officers (and perhaps many members of our society) that such modus operandi is essential, legitimate and justified, if not legally then morally.

Such attitudes towards vigilantism on the part of the police have been witnessed most staunchly in the pedestalisation of police personalities such as Chaudhry Aslam and Rao Anwar and the reliance on police encounter killings by both civilian and military regimes in Pakistan.

A selective review of the literature

Pakistan-centric research on policing has a long way to go. Nevertheless, a handful of studies provide important insights on police violence. In 2008, for example, Chaudhry et al. examined over 1,800 victims of alleged police torture who were patients at the office of the Surgeon Medico legal in Lahore.

In their study, they found that majority of the victims of police torture were men (91.5 per cent) and those who belonged to lower socio-economic groups, such as the labour class from rural areas, were victimised most frequently. In their description of the methods used against these victims, they write that torture techniques included physical trauma caused by blunt objects, rolling heavy objects over victims’ bodies, placing them over ice blocks, suspending them in air (by their limbs, or upside down).

Physical torture was recorded through visible injuries ranging from skin abrasions to bone fractures. Body parts most targeted during torture techniques included buttocks, soles of feet, chest, thighs, palms and wrists. Victims were predominantly tortured by sticks and ""broad, flat leather slipper(s) dipped in mustard oil to increase the impact of pain.""

In 2012, Mirza et al. carried out a cross-sectional, autopsy-based study over a period of six years (2005-2010) on custodial deaths in Karachi, examining 61 cases of which 21pc were homicidal deaths occurring from physical trauma resulting from torture. The study does not, however, indicate whether such torture was inflicted by police and prison officials or fellow prisoners.

In 2017, scholars at the Heavy Industries Taxila, Wah and Rawalpindi Medical Colleges published a study based on 318 autopsies performed at a hospital in Rawalpindi in 2015. They found that, of these, at least eight people (seven males, one female) died due to police torture in Rawalpindi, most likely during interrogation.

In 2012, Asad Jamal wrote on extrajudicial executions for the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. In his discussion on custodial deaths, Jamal found that between 1992 and 2009, the number of deaths in police custody had declined, demonstrating that trends can shift over time.

Jamal recognises though that such statistics do not include the many incidents of police abuse that do not get reported. Additionally, the report stresses that this decline was likely due to growing media coverage of such incidents following which the identities of both victims and perpetrators are revealed, and not necessarily due to cultural changes within the police or any significant policy changes more generally.

As research by a police officer Kamran Adil shows, police violence continues to be legitimised when it is said to be ‘necessary’ for extracting evidence, controlling crime (through encounter killings, for example) or in compliance with court orders. Such legitimation hardly makes all forms of police violence legal and is likely to allow the repetition of such practices (torture and extrajudicial killings), even if the presence of watchdogs periodically deters the police and their patrons.

In-depth: How not to improve law and order in Karachi

In 2014, Justice Project Pakistan and Yale Law School’s Allard K. Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic published a detailed report on police torture in Faisalabad. The report was based on allegations of police abuse and misconduct in Faisalabad between 2006 and 2018, and relied on 1,867 medio-legal certificates for physician evaluations, interviews with victims of police abuse and a review of existing laws. The researchers found that in 1,424 of the 1,867 cases of alleged police abuse (76pc), physicians had confirmed signs of physical abuse.

In 2016, Najm-ul-Sahr-Ata-Ullah and Saroop Ijaz wrote an extensive report for the Human Rights Watch that documented custodial torture, extrajudicial killings and other forms of police abuse in Pakistan. In the introductory section, they quote a police officer: ""My staff and I are expected to be on duty 24 hours a day. We are perpetually exhausted…. How can you expect people to work under such conditions and not crack?""

The report is one of the few that adequately acknowledges the limitations and pressures of the police, exposing the institutional fault lines and their exploitation by powerful social elites (politicians, landowners, civil and military bureaucracy). It is this exploitation by powerful elites that, I believe, should be thoroughly investigated in future research.

A call for institutional introspection

Recently, a senior police officer explained to me that the police has used torture primarily for the following purposes: (1) to extract confessions, (2) to effect recoveries of stolen items (such as the recent torture of a Vehari woman by the police), (3) to make extra money and (4) to appease a ‘master’ or a political patron (such as the torture of the MQM party workers).

In other discussions, police officers have pointed out that the use of torture and extrajudicial practices by select police officials give the rest of the institution a ‘bad name’.

Countless recommendations have been provided by journalists, analysts and police officers on how to positively change police organisations in Pakistan. These range from investments in police recruitment, training and education, to independent oversight mechanisms that ensure accountability (internal and external) and transparency, to higher salaries for police officials and better resources for police stations and units and the digitisation of policing (including installing cameras inside police lock-ups).

All of these are strong recommendations and I don’t doubt that police reform and freedom from police torture go hand in hand, as police officers themselves have recognised.

Based on some of the readings above and my own research on policing, I want to offer a few reasons as to why police officers themselves should rethink encouraging police abuse or ignoring its prevalence.

Police abuse corrupts institutional memory:

The continued reliance upon torture and similar methods teaches low-ranked police officials that acting outside and above the law, through informal procedures and practices, is routine and justified.

It tells them that confessions extracted through torture and the elimination of criminals will amount to positive professional achievements and good performance that will guarantee them job security and accelerated promotions, not to mention the fattening up that comes with financial benefits often accrued by policemen appeasing their political patrons.

Explore: Punjab's 'encounters' with sectarianism

New recruits are groomed by this thinking when they enter the organisation and it passes down to others, generation after generation, which explains why every few years we see an outcry over police abuse, ranging from torture to extrajudicial killings.

As Faisal Ali Raja, a senior police manager, has adequately stated, ""the behavioral change under a controlled environment at training colleges and schools is quite easy, but the real challenge begins when a fresh recruit starts working in the field."" The education the officer receives on the job has a fundamental role to play in how fairly or unfairly he or she will behave with civilians.

It furthers the politicisation of policing

As Zaigham Khan recently wrote, ""without the police, elections can’t be won, properties can’t be seized and retained, and adversaries can’t be tamed."" Knowing that select police officials and officers can be employed for extralegal purposes, other state institutions rely on the police for carrying out their dirty work.

This means that the civilian police remains vulnerable to external political influences and demands and can be utilised as a tool for political killings and for suppressing dissent, opposition and other challenges to the status quo.

Op-ed: Roots of custodial deaths

The police routinely claims that it is under pressure to deliver. This delivery of police performance in the form of forced confessions and extrajudicial killings raises important questions on the politics behind policing. Who is authorising such practices? Where are these pressures coming from? Police officers know the sources better than anyone else.

Those who resist politicisation are vulnerable to transfers and suspensions. Those who don’t, expose the rest of the rank-and-file to these external pressures, becoming – actively or passively – enablers of police politicisation and subsequent abuse of power. Given that all policing is political, this is perhaps the most challenging aspect of this profession.

It erodes police legitimacy:

Public trust in police organisations in Pakistan has generally been low. Allegations of torture and killings further undermine the reputation of police officers and result in civilians harbouring a negative image of the police, even if they have never actually interacted with police officers, because of a perception of the thaana culture.

This means that civilians will be less likely to respect the authority of police officials or believe that the police is the institution most adequate for maintaining order and public safety, encouraging them to look elsewhere (to private or paramilitary agents, for example). A lack of public legitimacy keeps the police demoralised, and police officers cynical.

It evidences an authoritarian subculture of policing:

Police culture generally has a poor reputation with embedded aspects such as cynicism, machoism, suspicion, discrimination, conservatism and authoritarianism routinely highlighted. This is of course grossly reductive, and it misses the important and complicated nuances within organisational cultures, as well as their many positive attributes.

No doubt, not all police officers are mindlessly authoritarian. But practices and procedures can nevertheless be authoritarian in nature, and they may very well be a product of authoritarian political values in a country that projects itself as a democracy, which creates space for an authoritarian subculture within police departments.

Authoritarian subcultures within organisations resist transparency, accountability and change; focus is on exerting control and power; prioritise maintaining the writ of the state by force; and counter the efforts of well-meaning officers who spend their careers dealing with the crises of police-community relations.

The more things change…

In 1974, prominent political scientist Eqbal Ahmad wrote an article Pakistan – Signposts to a police state, where he critically analysed the events, policies and practices during the then Pakistan People's Party regime.

He warned that in Pakistan, repressive measures are increasing, as could be witnessed through an expanding national security sector, the militarisation of the police, bureaucracy and civil society, the institutionalisation of terror, clampdowns on media, the creation of specialised police units (such as the Federal Security Force) and ""the obvious indifference being shown to 'unofficial' violence and terrorism against opponents of the government, and the emerging practice of systematic torture of prisoners.""

Although police torture featured marginally in Ahmad’s article, it was contextualised as being indicative of increasing authoritarianism in Pakistan. I believe his insights are as relevant today as they were 45 years ago.

In a joint statement, PBC vice chairman Abid Saqi, PBC member and president of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) Syed Qalb-i-Hassan and PBC executive committee chairman Azam Nazeer Tarar regretted that as reported members of intelligence agencies allegedly forced the Sindh IG to issue orders for arrest of retired Capt Mohammad Safdar, the husband of PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz.

Ironically, no categorical contradiction or denial of these reports had so for been made by the authorities concerned, whereas the government of Sindh had tacitly confirmed the same, the statement said.

In the statement, the SCBA president said that the legal fraternity had particularly noted that of late the federal government was always trying to embarrass and let down the Sindh government on one pretext or the other.

In a joint statement, PBC vice chairman Abid Saqi, PBC member and president of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) Syed Qalb-i-Hassan and PBC executive committee chairman Azam Nazeer Tarar regretted that as reported members of intelligence agencies allegedly forced the Sindh IG to issue orders for arrest of retired Capt Mohammad Safdar, the husband of PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz.
Ironically, no categorical contradiction or denial of these reports had so for been made by the authorities concerned, whereas the government of Sindh had tacitly confirmed the same, the statement said.
In the statement, the SCBA president said that the legal fraternity had particularly noted that of late the federal government was always trying to embarrass and let down the Sindh government on one pretext or the other.
The PBC statement regretted that by resorting to such crude and illegal action even privacy of a female leader of the opposition had been violated which neither “our religion nor our culture, law and ethics permit”.","['bar', 'president', 'kidnapping', 'chairman', 'assails', 'regretted', 'vice', 'statement', 'sindh', 'ig', 'pbc', 'scba', 'reported']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/10/5f8fea424b3fb.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/10/5f8fea424b3fb.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd329902b790.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/10/5f92585f1e465.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/10/5f92585f1e465.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/10/5f92585f1e465.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'No categorical denial of the alleged kidnapping of the Sindh IG has been made by the authorities concerned, statement says.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1586574', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'PBC assails ‘kidnapping’ of Sindh police IG', 'description': 'No categorical denial of the alleged kidnapping of the Sindh IG has been made by the authorities concerned, statement says.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/10/5f92585f1e465.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1586574', 'title': 'PBC assails ‘kidnapping’ of Sindh police IG', 'description': 'No categorical denial of the alleged kidnapping of the Sindh IG has been made by the authorities concerned, statement says.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/10/5f92585f1e465.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-10-23 07:05:19', 'modified_time': '2020-10-23 09:16:39', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/397/the-newspaper-s-staff-reporter'}, 'author': ""The Newspaper's Staff Reporter""})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1308798,1/16/17 15:55,Mother sentenced to death for 'honour killing' of daughter Zeenat Bibi,"An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Lahore on Monday sentenced a mother to death in a case of 'honour killing' for burning her daughter alive in June 2016 after she contracted a 'free-will marriage'.

18-year-old Zeenat Rafiq of Lahore's Factory Area was set on fire by her mother Parveen Bibi more than a week after the girl reportedly eloped with Hasan Khan to marry him before a court in Lahore.

Parveen Bibi had earlier confessed she had murdered her daughter for ""bringing shame to the family"".

Police had suspected that Parveen was helped by her son and son-in-law in killing the girl.

ATC-IV judge Chaudhry Muhammad Ilyas on Monday sentenced Parveen to death in the 'honour killing' case, and sentenced Zeenat's brother Anees to life in prison. Zeenat's sister's husband was acquitted in the case.

It was revealed in court that Zeenat's mother and brothers had first beaten her, then her mother threw kerosene on her and set her on fire.

Parveen in court today accepted responsibility for Zeenat's death.

Zeenat's husband, Hasan Khan last June had agreed to let his wife return to her home after her family promised, in the days before her murder, to organise a traditional wedding reception for the couple.

He earlier told the media that Zeenat was not willing to go back to her parents’ home because she feared they would kill her. ""But she agreed after her family gave assurances regarding her safety,"" he was quoted by a TV channel as saying.

Witnesses had told Dawn that they had alerted the emergency rescue service after they saw smoke coming out of Parveen’s home.

""Police and rescue firefighters reached the spot, put out the blaze and recovered the body of the girl,"" a witness had said earlier.

After Zeenat Bibi was set on fire in a low-income neighbourhood of Lahore, none of her relatives sought to claim her body, police said, leaving her husband's family to bury her charred remains in the dark in a graveyard near the city.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1450509,12/10/18 7:16,"Govt asked to promote girl education, stop child marriage","PESHAWAR: The civil society organisations have demanded of the government to take effective steps to promote girl education and discourage child marriages in the province.

A joint statement of various organisations issued here on Sunday in connection with International Human Rights Day said that according to Unicef report 21 per cent of girls in the country got married before reaching the age of 18.

The organisations including Pakhtunkhwa Civil Society Network, Peace Justice and Youth Organisation, Provincial Alliance to End Early Child and Forced Marriages, Blue Veins, National Action Coordination Group and Partners for Prevention and Response (P4pR) said that civil society and government should work jointly for rights of the vulnerable segments of the society.

The statement also quoted a report of Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), saying the age of 74 per cent of the married girls in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was less than 16 years.

“Child marriage is an appalling violation of human rights and robs girls of their education, health and long-term prospects,” said Qamar Naseem, the programme coordinator of Blue Veins.

Pakhtunkhwa Civil Society Network coordinator Taimur Kamal said that by permitting child marriage, the government was responsible for serious harms suffered by the girls. He said that it required a comprehensive response to stop child marriage. “Having a law that sets a uniform, internationally recognised minimum marriage age of 18 for both boys and girls, is an important aspect,” he said.

District Commission on Status of Women chairperson Shaheen Qureshi said that complications of pregnancy and childbirth were leading causes of death in young women. She said that girls, who married later and delayed pregnancy beyond their adolescence, had more chances to stay healthier and educate and build a better life for themselves and their families.

“To achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), immediate action must be taken to improve access to education and end child marriage,” said the statement.

A case was registered by Sukkur Police against the suspect who leads prayers at a mosque in Dildar Samejo village.

""We arrested the prayer leader of the mosque after he was accused of raping a 10-year-old girl and registered a case against him,"" said Sukkur SSP Irfan Samoon.

Perspective: Why sexual abuse of children remains widely prevalent

According to the SSP, a letter was issued by the police so a medical exam of the girl could be carried out. The girl used to take Holy Quran lessons from the prayer leader, he said.

UNITED NATIONS: Violence linked to culture was the main reason for a 20 per cent rise in deaths and injuries of females in Afghanistan last year, UN special envoy to Afghanistan Jan Kubis said on Monday.

Despite an overall fall in annual civilian casualties in Afghanistan for the first time in several years, the United Nations said last month that more than 300 women and girls were killed and more than 560 injured during 2012.

“The majority is linked to domestic violence, tradition, culture of the country,” Kubis told reporters at the United Nations in New York ahead of a debate on Afghanistan by the UN Security Council on Tuesday.

“Of course there are very clearly attacks on women's activists by the insurgency,” he said. “Then there are unfortunate situations when indeed women are killed while doing their daily chores (by unexploded bombs).”

Western human rights advocates say cultural tradition is often used to justify abuse of women such as female genital mutilation and honor killings. Afghanistan is a conservative Muslim country, where under Taliban rule between 1996 and 2001 women were forced to cover up and were banned from voting, most work and leaving their homes unless accompanied by a husband or male relative.

US-backed Afghan forces toppled the Taliban in late 2001 for refusing to hand over Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after the Sept 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.

As foreign forces prepare to withdraw by the end of 2014 after a more than decade-long war, the United Nations and rights groups are concerned human rights in Afghanistan, particularly those of women, will further deteriorate.

Afghan women have won back basic rights in education, voting and employment since the Taliban were ousted from power in 2001, but fears are mounting that such freedoms could be traded away as Kabul seeks peace talks with the group.

Activists and some lawmakers have blamed the rise in violence against women on what they say is waning interest in women's rights on the part of Afghan President Hamid Karzai's government, a claim Karzai denies.

The UN political mission in Afghanistan, led by Kubis, said in December that Afghanistan still had a long way to go in implementing the 2009 Law on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which made child marriage, forced marriage, rape and other violent acts criminal offenses.

“Our role as the UN will be very crucial in the post-2014 period,” Kubis said on Monday. “We will be one of the promoters, advocates of what should be practices in a country that will be perhaps more traditional and will be coming back to its roots.”

“The situation is of concern and will remain of concern,” he said of violence against women and girls.

Women who pursue careers in conservative Afghanistan routinely face opposition in a society where often they are ostracized - or worse - for mixing with men other than husbands or relatives.

A UN policy-making body agreed on Friday to a declaration urging an end to violence against women and girls despite concerns from conservative Muslim countries and the Vatican about references to women's sexual and reproductive rights.","['Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

Concerns over rising incidents

The police study also did a comparative analysis of child abuses with other three provinces, which revealed that the most child abuse cases were reported in Punjab followed by Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Referring to various child abuse cases in Punjab, the police study noted with concern that such cases were increasing in Sindh.

It pointed out two cases in Naushahro Feroze district, which had been declared as “utterly unbelievable and extremely reprehensible”.

In one case, a man confessed that he had been raping her two daughters for nearly a year. The police took action against him when the victims approached the police and filed a written complaint against him.

As nobody believed their ordeal, the victims managed to film a video of their father, which later on was submitted to the police for further investigation.

In another such case in the same area, a paternal uncle was alleged to have broken into a house and sexually assaulted his minor niece. Later the mother singlehandedly protested and demanded the justice.

Call to spread awareness among children

Citing several research studies carried out in the country and abroad, the police study said there were adverse consequences of child abuse ranging from social, emotional, cognitive, educational problems, to low self-esteem and self-harm or sometimes it may lead to suicide.

There were also links between physical abuse, depression, and aggressive behaviours.

“It appears that males and females react differently to trauma, with males engaging in more antisocial behaviours and females becoming more withdrawn.”

Other long-term effects included criminal risk taking behaviours and drug and alcohol problems.

Several recommendations have been made to control child abuse cases such as blocking porn websites, stamping out drug mafias and creating awareness among young children about child abuse at schools.

It also called for adopting child protection policies.

Several recommendations have been made to control child abuse cases such as blocking porn websites, stamping out drug mafias and creating awareness among young children about child abuse at schools.","['victims', 'child', 'arrested', 'children', 'cases', 'abuse', 'courts', '358', 'sindh', 'pending', 'presented', 'suspects', 'reported']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/04/5ca4615fe2ab2.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189f00b83e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0d52ba8a43.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/03/5e6ef7b377bd8.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d005917e0.jpg?0.8785461548197806', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/04/5ca4615fe2ab2.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21824a8678.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189916390d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/03/5e6ef7b377bd8.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/11/5dce12e63253b.jpg?r=30712423', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0ec56aad75.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/11/5dce12e63253b.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd22283a73d3.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fc7833a64a3a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18a3ece187.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f94d8916a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f4142e469.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24c3aad888.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24e90196c5.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/03/5e6ef7b377bd8.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Around 96 boys and 20 girls have fallen prey to abusers in Karachi alone.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1541169', 'type': 'article', 'title': '358 child abuse cases reported in last five years across Sindh', 'description': 'Around 96 boys and 20 girls have fallen prey to abusers in Karachi alone.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/03/5e6ef7b377bd8.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1541169', 'title': '358 child abuse cases reported in last five years across Sindh', 'description': 'Around 96 boys and 20 girls have fallen prey to abusers in Karachi alone.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/03/5e6ef7b377bd8.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-03-16 07:00:38', 'modified_time': '2020-03-16 08:52:15', 'tag': 'Violence against children', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/1200/imtiaz-ali'}, 'keywords': 'Violence against children', 'news_keywords': 'Violence against children', 'author': 'Imtiaz Ali'})",[],dawn

The victim’s mother informed police that her son, who works as a labourer in Kalar Syedan, was forcibly taken to a house by the three suspects and sexually assaulted.

A woman, who was also present at the house, filmed the offence on her mobile phone.

Separately, another suspect accused of sexually abusing a 10-year-boy has been arrested.

According to police, the victim’s father, a resident of Pirwadhai, lodged a complaint stating his son had been working at a milk shop and stayed there one night. The boy was sobbing when he returned home and told his father that the owner of the shop allegedly sexually assaulted him and afterwards threatened to kill him if he told anybody.

The suspect also threatened the victim’s father when he went to the shop to confront him about the incident. The victim’s medical examination was carried out by police after which the suspect was arrested.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1579389,9/13/20 6:51,The ‘honour’ in murder,"ACCORDING to Human Rights Watch, almost 1,000 women are murdered in Pakistan in the name of honour each year — killed on the grounds of ‘unacceptable’ amorous relationships, defiance of physical or cyber-gendered spaces, brazenness in dressing and language or perceived immorality.

Qandeel Baloch was one such woman who was shunned and eventually killed for challenging entrenched patriarchal norms. Her struggle warrants particular mention because she inspired and propelled (though posthumously) critical reform in the law that deals with ‘honour’ killing in Pakistan. This year marks her fourth death anniversary.

Qandeel reclaimed — or at least attempted to reclaim — online spaces in a society that strictly limits women’s access to public spaces. Through her bold and vocal videos and statements, Qandeel asserted her independence to live according to her own choices, and refused to conform. And for that, she was seen as a slight to her family’s so-called honour, as someone who deserved to be brutally killed. In the aftermath of her death, Qandeel has been reimagined as a symbol of defiance, independence and women’s empowerment, but her death is also a reminder of the fate of bold and vocal women in Pakistan who challenge the status quo, and societal notions of what is acceptable, decent, and proper.

Many others have since met a similar fate. Earlier this year, two teenage girls were brutally murdered by a family member in a Waziristan village, after a video of them surfaced on social media. In July, 24-year-old Waziran was stoned to death in Jamshoro by her husband and brother, allegedly on the pretext of honour. Last month, police named a man who had shot dead his 19-year-old sister in Karachi because of her “constant interactions” with a “man in the neighbourhood”.

Qandeel asserted her independence. For that, she was seen as someone who deserved to be killed.

In our law, taking a person’s life — mostly women — in the name of honour has been treated differently from conventional murder.

The courts’ decisions have often viewed the accused — mostly men — in such cases with particular empathy, treating the ‘affront’ to his honour in, let’s say, finding his sister with her ‘lover’ as a mitigating circumstance that entitles him to a lesser punishment. Confronted with such a situation, it has been reasoned in the past that a man may have been so gravely and suddenly provoked that he lost his power of self-control, causing the death of the person responsible for the so-called ‘provocation’. Taking a person’s life in such state of loss of self-control would not amount to ‘murder’ but to ‘culpable homicide’ punishable at the judges’ discretion to imprisonment for a term varying from 10 years to life imprisonment.

Despite judgements to the contrary, such rationale — which is based on a legal exception that was removed from our law some decades ago — has on occasion been upheld by Pakistan’s superior courts in cases of honour killing. This, coupled with the erstwhile capacity of a victim’s wali, or legal heir, to either compound the offence and/or waive the right of qisas (retributive penalty) by forgiving the person guilty of killing for honour (often a relative) has unfortunately permitted (relative) impunity to such murderers under our law.

The legislature has made relevant amendments to the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure twice in the recent past — first in 2004, and again in 2016, following the brutal murder of Qandeel Baloch — to provide that qatl-i-amd, or murder committed on the pretext of honour, shall be subject to a minimum penalty of life imprisonment regardless of the compounding of the offence and/or waiver of qisas by the victim’s family. The amended law has thereby rescinded the courts’ erstwhile discretion and the requirement of a family’s preference and/or consent in sentencing in such cases.

There was hope that such amendments had closed the “loopholes and lacunae in the existing laws”. However, judicial verdicts continued to hand out concessions to murderers who had killed women, and in some cases men, in the name of honour. In 2018, the Supreme Court, by relying on the principle of grave and sudden provocation, reduced the life sentence of an accused who had admitted to murdering his sister-in-law in the name of ghairat or honour, to that of rigorous imprisonment of 20 years.

It is in this context that the importance of the Supreme Court’s recent decision in ‘Muhammad Abbas v The State’ must be appreciated. First, the order unequivocally held that following the 2004 and 2016 amendments, murder committed in the name of honour is subject to the minimum penalty of life imprisonment, even where there may be an element of grave and sudden provocation. Second, in passing the order, the court effectively overruled the treatment of grave and sudden provocation, through an affront to a person’s honour, as a mitigating factor in the treatment of and sentencing in honour killing cases.

Lastly, the apex court emphasised that “the Holy Quran … does not permit killing on the ground of adultery, let alone on the ground of ghairat [honour] … nor prescribes a lesser punishment for such killings”. All lives are sacred in Islam, the court reasoned, and a murder committed in the name of honour does not entail lesser culpability.

With the door hopefully shut to the application of the principle of grave and sudden provocation in honour killings, and the Supreme Court’s clear emphasis on the minimum penalty of life imprisonment for killing over honour, the loopholes in the law may have finally closed.

Yet, this judgement and its interpretation of the 2004 and 2016 amendments may not impact the incidence of honour killing in our society much; the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan reported “little evidence that the incidence of honour crimes has abated” despite the aforementioned legal amendments.

The scholars were attending a dialogue, jointly organised by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) office of UN Women and the EVAW Alliance KP, to observe the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence (GBV). The scholars also signed a declaration condemning gender-based violence and vowed to spread awareness in their respective communities to put an end to the practice.

They also acknowledged that while any individual can be a victim of GBV, in Pakistan, women, ""being the most vulnerable segment of society and deprived of their basic rights"", were more likely to face such violence, followed by members of the transgender community. The scholars emphasised that it was the state's responsibility to protect the vulnerable sections of society.

""There is a need to strengthen state-run social protection networks and ensure the provision of required support to vulnerable groups,” the press release quoted the scholars as saying.

“For prevention of gender-based violence, the state has primary responsibility to protect its citizens and religious leaders have a strong potential to influence the lives and behaviour of those who follow their faith and share their beliefs,” they further said.

Explaining the role of religious leaders in efforts against GBV, EVAW/G Alliance co-Chair Qamar Naseem said that scholars had great influence over people and can help in ""shaping the behaviour of local communities"".

“It is essential to engage religious scholars from different faith groups, as a practical strategy, to raise awareness on gender-based violence and address the issue,” Naseem was quoted as saying.

Provincial head of United Nations Women KP, Zainab Qaisar Khan, said that gender-based violence was not limited to domestic abuse, sexual violence including rape and honour crimes and added: “It can happen anywhere, anytime and across all classes irrespective of education level and income status.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1566670,7/3/20 7:05,Harassment case: Two more staffers suspended after students put forth demands,"LAHORE: At least two more members of the staff from the Lahore Grammar School were suspended after a charter of demands drafted by students and alumni of the LGS 1A1 was presented to the director of the school.

Those who were suspended included the names of main accused Ms Maira Omair Rana and Ms Rubina Shakil for turning a blind eye to the harassment cases brought before them. In the aftermath of the story published in Dawn on June 30, 2020, more allegations by students have surfaced on social media of sexual harassment on campus.

The charter was prepared in response to these claims of sexual harassment which surfaced earlier this week. The students and alumni representatives pushed for a complete reform in the school with regard to sexual harassment which was accepted by the director.

“Ms Nighat Ali said that many of the demands were already being imposed in the school while the rest were also something that they agreed upon and would soon implement them in coming days,” said a representative. “Overall change will take some time but the school was more than happy to listen to us.”

Earlier, the teachers involved in harassment were terminated. An inquiry committee will be overseen by Ms Ali, and will comprise senior members of LGS as well as alumni representatives.

There was the demand of making the procedure of complaints and counseling accessible for harassment victims. A form to be filled in details of a complaint was advised by the students so that they could fill it in themselves without the involvement of parents, and to hide their privacy.

“We also asked them to put up an anti-harassment policy in a public place including the website,” said the alumni representative. “There must also be trainings for all teachers and faculties, and handbooks.”

Meanwhile, the Women’s Action Forum Lahore finally broke its silence and expressed its ‘disturbance’ over the news of harassment allegations. The WAF appreciated the students who had the courage and confidence to complain about sexual harassment and bringing a very serious though neglected issue to public notice. They highlighted that sexual harassment was found in all private and public institutions, as well as in single sex and coeducational institutions and madrassahs where both girls and boys are vulnerable.

The WAF highlighted that the Punjab Sexual Harassment at Workplace Act, 2014 does not apply to students and that an effective system and mechanism within it needs to be put in place to ensure that students’ complaints are immediately heard and addressed. It also said that parents must also recognize the importance of initiatives such as school workshops on CSA, puberty and adolescence that are taken to ensure the safety of the child.

“It is not the matter of just one school, neither should it be sensationalized,” said one member of WAF. “This is a social evil present in every sector and every institution, be it a madrassah or a private school.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1403733,4/25/18 7:08,Relatives held over Pakistani-origin Italian woman’s ‘honour’ killing,"GUJRAT: A magistrate on Tuesday ordered that the body of an Italian woman of Pakistani origin, who was allegedly murdered for ‘honour’ in the neighbourhood of Mangowal in the city of Gujrat in Punjab on April 18, be exhumed on Wednesday (today) for further investigation.

According to the victim’s family, 26-year-old Sana Cheema had died of natural causes a week ago within the jurisdiction of the Kunjah police station and was buried without an autopsy being conducted.

However, Asad Gujjar, a spokesperson for the Gujrat police, told Dawn that the district police officer had taken notice of news reports in the Italian media, which suggested that she had been murdered for honour, and a social media campaign by her close friends who demanded an investigation into her sudden death.

News of Ms Cheema’s death was reported in a local Italian newspaper, Giornale di Brescia, and members of the Pakistani community in Brescia, Italy, had held a demonstration over the weekend, demanding to know the truth about her death.

Body of 26-year-old Pakistani-origin woman to be exhumed in Gujrat today

They claimed that Ms Cheema had wanted to marry someone in Italy, against her family’s wishes. The reports further alleged that Ms Cheema’s parents had been forcing her to marry someone in the family in the days leading up to her murder.

According to Italian media, Ms Cheema had wanted to marry a man from Brescia who, like her, was a second-generation immigrant with Italian citizenship.

Mr Gujjar said that the Kunjah police visited Mangowal town, where Ms Cheema had been staying with her family, and collected some information about her death which strengthened their suspicions about the version offered by the woman’s family.

After an initial inquiry, the police lodged a murder case against Sana’s father, Ghulam Mustafa Cheema, her brother Adnan Cheema, and her uncle Mazhar Iqbal Cheema, on a complaint filed by Kunjah SHO Waqar Gujjar.

The police have taken most of the suspects into custody but they are still looking for her brother, who appears to be on the run.

The police submitted an application to a district and sessions judge who referred the matter to a magistrate. The magistrate decided the application the same day and ordered that the body be exhumed without delay. He also directed the medical superintendent of Aziz Bhatti Shaheed Teaching Hospital to appoint a doctor and staff to conduct an autopsy of the body.

Police have refused to comment on the possible cause of death, saying that would be determined by the autopsy report.

The Italian Foreign Ministry has said that it is following the case through its embassy in Islamabad, which is gathering information to define the circumstances surrounding Ms Cheema’s death.

Earlier in 2016, a British woman of Pakistani origin, Samia Shahid from Jhelum, was allegedly killed by her father and former husband for contracting a second marriage without obtaining divorce from her first husband. The case is still in trial, but her father died in jail of cardiac arrest in 2017 while her former husband is still in jail.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1322924,3/26/17 7:51,NON-FICTION: Murders Most Foul,"Last year, when the anti-‘honour’ killing law was proposed, it was expected that under the legislation, murderers of women would not be pardoned. Campaigners called for tougher legislation that would put an end to acquittals based on (family) forgiveness in ‘honour’ violence. The state’s message should have been that violence cannot be masked in honour, but this has not happened. ‘Honour’ violence cases are often negotiated and settled before they are adjudicated. The verdict is dependent on judges deciding whether the crime qualifies as an ‘honour’ killing or not. The punishment for ‘honour’ killing is now life imprisonment — the perpetrator must confess, and witnesses collaborate. This is precisely why the new law is problematic, as anthropologist-turned-politician Nafisa Shah explains in her study of honour crimes in upper Sindh. Based on research she began in 1995, Honour Unmasked unravels the nexus between the criminal justice system and state officials, and tribal power structures that perpetuate ‘honour’ violence. While examining ‘honour’ violence or karo-kari (a term that literally translates to ‘black man’ and ‘black woman’), she explains why it is not only an acceptable social norm and a violent cultural product, but also a practice appropriated in the politics of social relations and competition over resources, land and power.

What is troubling throughout this well-researched narrative by a former journalist is that acquittals for ‘honour’ crimes will likely continue undeterred. Perpetrators — mostly brothers, husbands, fathers, uncles and sometimes mothers — will kill women knowing that they will be forgiven. The very act of killing is described as “amputating a rotten finger.” It perpetuates a discourse of killers as victims protecting family and tribal honour. The death of a woman establishes her guilt. This discourse delinks violence from honour because the violence is collective and cultural. Shah’s discussion revolves around the responsibility of judges, tribal leaders, politicians and mediators, but we barely hear from women survivors. She alludes to “invisible” runaway women — those who are not killed for their supposed transgressions, but instead banished or often forcibly married. Here one wonders if their strategies for survival, and the life stories of couples who marry for love, could have merited more discussion.

While the author unpicks the complexities and the ceremonies of mediation — including the ideology of kheerkhandr (when sugar dissolves in milk to sweeten it) — as they exist within a framework supported by the colluding powers of the state (law and custom) and the elite (landowners and local politicians), she steers clear of critiquing a rooted practice. Perhaps this objective approach works for her, especially as she served as Khairpur’s administrator between 2001 and 2005 when she mediated between feuding families. This lends enormous credibility to her work and talks of her interventions, but as a vocal parliamentarian known to stand up for women’s rights, she doesn’t always work out ways to stop ‘honour’ violence.

Bringing a despicable facet of Pakistan’s patriarchal culture to the fore

Women are killed by male relatives for exercising their right to marry, for running away from the family home, for decisions to work or over family feuds and land disputes. Explaining that customs are never “neatly bounded cultural archetypes,” Shah asserts that karo-kari murders are prevalent among Baloch tribes, near the border with Sindh. In 2008, five women were buried alive in district Nasirabad in Balochistan, allegedly by Abdul Sattar Umrani, brother of Mir Sadiq Umrani, a PPP provincial minister. The three girls aged between 16 and 18 wanted to marry men of their choice but tribal elders refused permission. They were shot, but survived. When their mother and an aunt intervened to save them, all five women were allegedly pushed into a ditch and buried alive. What is even more horrific is that Senator Israrullah Zehri, while in the Senate, defended the murders as part of Baloch tradition, claiming that women’s defiance would not be tolerated, and reiterated the same on a television program when I interviewed him.

Meanwhile, religion is rarely discussed as part of the discourse on karo-kari killings. “No perpetrator or member of the community involved in such killings justifies them by using Islamic rhetoric as the basis for the murder,” writes Shah. Another observation is the representation of ‘honour’ crime in Sindhi newspapers since the 1990s — the latter having coined the term karo-kari. Adept at showing “the close-ups of death, while shocking and vulgar to the sensibilities of viewers,” the media have engendered a new debate on the agency of the dead body. On the surface, this is akin to creating a sensational spectacle. But when newspapers such as the daily Kawish display photographs of the dead, they are documenting the women’s stories — gory as this may be. Apparently, they even publish photographs of hand-holding, smiling couples who have married of their free will. Karo-kari and love-marriage couples share the same space to tell different stories. While cutting out pictures from newspapers and storing them in plastic bags to ensure the “truthfulness of their claims,” families reveal an almost bizarre resilience.

Men labelled karo are banished from their villages and rarely killed. Compensation by the accused man to the victim’s family is usual practice. However, the victim’s murderer can be acquitted, if her family forgives and settles with the perpetrator. The anti-‘honour’ killing law has not removed the concept of clemency which is sanctioned by the courts because families are facilitated to forgive. It becomes easier for the family to forgive him when the perpetrator is a close relative of the victim — evident after the murder of social media celebrity Qandeel Baloch when her parents eventually decided to forgive their son whom they had accused of her murder. In fact, there are negligible convictions in karo-kari cases — as low as three per cent in trial courts.

Documenting over 60 cases, including those in her home town of Khairpur, Shah refers to two murdered women from Shikarpur — Abida and Tehmina. Through this case, she shows how acquittals happen after negotiated settlements using the legal system that lends space to mask ‘honour’-related violence. Because murder falls under the law of qisas and diyat, making it a private matter between both parties and not a crime against the state, the victims’ heirs have the option to forgive the accused, demand retribution [qisas] or compensation [diyat]. Regarding another woman’s murder, she writes that “the judges were also sympathetic to the survivors and allowed the compounding of the offence.” In other words, there is no difference in most cases of ‘honour’ crimes between the family member who murders and the wali [guardian of the victim] who forgives.

Noor Khatoon’s story is one of willpower. As a young councillor pursuing her Masters degree at Shah Abdul Latif University she desperately wanted to escape her forced — or sang — marriage. Noor was one of the fortunate few able to cleverly orchestrate her escape, eventually making a new life for herself in Norway. But in the interim not only did she burn the side of her face with phosphorus, but tasked a sympathetic male storywriter to publish a (concocted) story in the press about the brutality of her in-laws and later, sought refuge at Panah Shelter Home in Karachi. If more women were to agitate and act like Noor had, they would question and likely reshape the brutal framework of history, law and power that accommodates murder with perfection.

Aijazuddin', 'Ashraf Jehangir Qazi', 'Zahid Hussain']","Campaigners called for tougher legislation that would put an end to acquittals based on (family) forgiveness in ‘honour’ violence.
The verdict is dependent on judges deciding whether the crime qualifies as an ‘honour’ killing or not.
The punishment for ‘honour’ killing is now life imprisonment — the perpetrator must confess, and witnesses collaborate.
The anti-‘honour’ killing law has not removed the concept of clemency which is sanctioned by the courts because families are facilitated to forgive.

The incident initially came to light when footage of the legislator's vehicle ramming into the traffic officer began circulating on social media.

Traffic Sergeant Haji Attaullah was seriously wounded in the accident and was taken to Civil Hospital Quetta for treatment where he succumbed to his injuries.

Police said the vehicle belonged to Majeed Khan Achakzai, a serving legislator belonging to the ruling coalition partners in the Balochistan government, the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP).

The legislator's vehicle was speeding and rammed into the traffic sergeant who was on duty at GPO Chowk, the police said.

MPA Achakzai confessed to involvement in the accident and claimed to have agreed to compensate the family members of the slain traffic policeman, Deputy Inspector General Police Razzaq Cheema said.

However, the Civil Lines Police Station lodged a First Information Report against unknown individuals.

""The law will take its course if the legislator fails to convince the family,"" Cheema added.

Achakzai, who was elected as an MPA for Balochistan in the PB-13 Killa Abdullah district, condemned ""certain elements"" who he claimed had declared him a criminal prior to a trial in court.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1379558,12/29/17 20:27,Couple murdered in Muzaffarabad in likely 'honour killing',"A man and a woman, believed to have eloped, were gunned down in Muzaffarabad, Azad Jammu and Kashmir on Friday by three unidentified assailants in what is being treated as a case of 'honour killing', police sources said.

Forty-six-year-old Sarfraz Khan — a labourer hailing from Swabi but a resident of Karachi according to his CNIC — and an unidentified woman accompanying him had arrived at the house of Chaudhry Maqsood, a former employer of Sarfraz's, a few days ago.

Upon arrival, Sarfraz had introduced the said woman as his wife to Maqsood, at whose place Sarfraz used to stay occassionally.

The couple was strolling in the yard of Maqsood's house around Friday noon when three assailants on a motorbike approached them. Seeing the men, the couple retreated into their room and locked it from the inside.

The commotion startled Maqsood’s family, who were told by the alleged attackers if they stay calm no harm would come to them.

The trio soon managed to break open the door, after which they sprayed the couple with bullets, killing them on the spot.

According to Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Muhammad Asif Durrani, the couple were hit by 14 bullets between themselves.

The police recovered a mobile phone from Sarfraz's body, with the only contact in the device being a certain Nazakat, another former employer of Sarfraz, whose house he had helped build and stayed at occasionally.

Upon contacting Nazakat, it was learnt that a woman claiming to be Sarfraz's first wife had paid him a visit, asking his whereabouts.

“I met her early on Friday,"" Nazakat was quoted as saying by ASP Durrani. ""She told me that Sarfraz was her [former] husband but he had divorced her and kidnapped another woman.""

Police further said Sarfraz's ex-wife was also accompanied by the slain woman's brother.

Meanwhile, the identities of the assailants have yet to be established, with the ASP saying: “Whether they entered the area on a motorcycle or if they were already staying here for some time is yet to be ascertained. We are keeping a strict roadside vigil and also checking guest lists of local hotels. We are also looking into the possibility of involvement of local facilitators.”","['Tariq Naqash', 'Patriotic Pakistani', 'Syed Bukhari', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/217496,11/4/06 0:00,Demand for legislation on abortion,"ISLAMABAD, Nov 3: Deputy Speaker National Assembly Sardar Mohammad Yaqoob said on Friday provided with a broad based consensus, the country could have separate legislation on abortion.

He made these remarks at the lunching ceremony of a booklet which contained oral testimonies of women who underwent the trauma of abortions and miscarriages in the country.

In response to the issue of abortion raised by other speakers on the occasion, Sardar Yaqoob said that discussion on abortion could be initiated in the National Assembly and if agreed, we could have legislation on abortion.

The booklet ‘Abortion, a dilemma - a reality’ has been written and researched by Qudsia Mehmood and Amna Khalid, two Leadership Development Mechanism (LDM) fellows.

Illiteracy coupled with poverty and societal taboos, women living in rural areas are facing multiple problems, be it decision-making at household level or choice about children, the deputy speaker added.

Referring to the women protection bill, Sardar Yaqoob said the bill would be presented in the next session of the National Assembly, and after its passage from the parliament, women would definitely feel empowered.

Tahira Abdullah, a women rights activist, criticized the government for allowing ‘extra-parliament’ forces to influence the decision-making in the legislature. She referred to the Ulma committee, which were constituted after the women protection bill had been presented to the National Assembly during its last session.

Once a bill is presented in the National Assembly only the parliament has the right to take a decision on it, she forcefully asserted.

However, Sardar Yaqoob argued that the government wanted to have complete consensus before passing amendments in the Hudood Ordinances proposed in the women protection bill.

Director, Uks, a civil society organization, in her remarks pointed out the issue of increasing teenage pregnancies in the country, both in married and unmarried cases.

“Unfortunately, we are in permanent state of denial and the issue of pregnancies in young women is knocking at our doors, which needs serious thinking on our part,” she said.

Talking about the booklet, she was of the view that the testimonies could have been more powerful, if the researchers would include some more information. However, she lauded the effort and called for the booklet’s dissemination through street- theatre, radio, TV and the print media.

In their presentation, the researchers said that the purpose of the study was to invite the attention of the concerned circles towards the rising incidence of abortions in the country.

They said one million women have abortions each year although, in Pakistan, abortion is illegal and is condemned as murder.

In the country abortion is only allowed to save the life of the woman; to preserve physical health and to preserve mental health.

However, in case of rape or incest, fetal impairment, economic or social reasons, it is not allowed.

But, abortion is allowed on these pretexts in India. Abortion is the termination of pregnancy by any method (spontaneous or induced) before the fetus is sufficiently developed to survive independently (fetus less than 20 weeks of pregnancy.

In Pakistan pregnant women who wish to have an abortion are forced to visit illegal clinics run by midwives, and 23 per cent of women, who have unskilled providers, are later hospitalised for complications.

Women often do not use contraception because of inaccessibility or financial constraints. In addition, many men in the country have religious objections in using contraception but do not object to abortion. Out of almost 35 million abortions which take place annually in the world, more than half of them are illegal and performed by untrained, unskilled persons and done under highly unhygienic conditions.","['Khawar Ghumman', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

In response to the issue of abortion raised by other speakers on the occasion, Sardar Yaqoob said that discussion on abortion could be initiated in the National Assembly and if agreed, we could have legislation on abortion.
She referred to the Ulma committee, which were constituted after the women protection bill had been presented to the National Assembly during its last session.
They said one million women have abortions each year although, in Pakistan, abortion is illegal and is condemned as murder.
In the country abortion is only allowed to save the life of the woman; to preserve physical health and to preserve mental health.","['sardar', 'yaqoob', 'assembly', 'protection', 'national', 'bill', 'abortion', 'country', 'abortions', 'women', 'legislation', 'demand']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd329902b790.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg', 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}",TRUE,http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'ISLAMABAD, Nov 3: Deputy Speaker National Assembly Sardar Mohammad Yaqoob said on Friday provided with a broad based...', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'http://beta.dawn.com/news/217496/demand-for-legislation-on-abortion', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Demand for legislation on abortion', 'description': 'ISLAMABAD, Nov 3: Deputy Speaker National Assembly Sardar Mohammad Yaqoob said on Friday provided with a broad based...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'http://beta.dawn.com/news/217496/demand-for-legislation-on-abortion', 'title': 'Demand for legislation on abortion', 'description': 'ISLAMABAD, Nov 3: Deputy Speaker National Assembly Sardar Mohammad Yaqoob said on Friday provided with a broad based...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2006-11-04 00:00:00', 'modified_time': '2006-11-04 00:00:00', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/313/khawar-ghumman'}, 'author': 'Khawar Ghumman'})",[],dawn

A final year student of nursing school was on duty in Medical Unit-III of the CMCH when confronted by three miscreants who tried to take her pictures on their cell phones and on resistance, thrashed her.

Medical Superintendent, Dr Zulfiqar Siyal sent a written complaint to SHO Civil Lines to register an FIR against Muhib Ali Chandio, Imran Gopang and Irfan Gopang after receiving an application from the victim. She stated that she had locked herself in a room on the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday when the lights had gone out and saw three men roaming in the corridor. She went to the ICU when power was restored and was checking blood pressure of a patient when she saw one of the men taking her photographs on his cell phone. She called the supervisor and watchman for her aid.

The MS in his letter said that the three arrested were sons of employees of the hospital and requested an appropriate action against them.

SHO Civil Lines said that he was waiting for the complainant to lodge an FIR.

Yet, in another incident, a man Arshad Ali Qureshi was overpowered by the staff of Shaikh Zayed Hospital while trying to enter a labour room, late on Tuesday night. He injured supervisor Mohammed Ismaiel Khoso, Mohammed Punhal Mashori and Panjal Khokhar with a dagger as they tried to block his entry.

They were admitted to the hospital. The MS of CMCH said that Arashad Ali Qureshi was arrested and a written complaint to Waleed police station had been sent for registration of an FIR.

Supervisor overpowered the intruder and handed him over to police. Sources said that the intruder broke into the labour room and started knocking the door of doctors' duty room.

Arshad Qureshi said that he was looking for his daughter Zahida Qureshi, 14, in the hospital. He said that Zahida went missing from their house four days ago and he was told that she had been admitted to the hospital.

The hospital sources said that there was no patient with name of Zahida Qureshi admitted to the hospital. Police said that Arshad Qureshi was not mentally sound.

Dr Shahida Shaikh, In-Charge, Unit-II said that she had, many a time, requested the Vice Chancellor of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Medical University and the MS of CMCH for enhancing the security.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1516630,11/14/19 7:08,"Consultant held over child pornography, abuse removed from KP govt project","PESHAWAR: The services of Sohail Ayaz, a consultant in a planning and development department project, were terminated on Wednesday following his arrest in Rawalpindi over child pornography and sexual abuse.

As Ayaz was convicted for paedophile sex offences in the UK, his appointment by a government department has also raised questions about the process of hiring consultants in donor-funded projects.

A notification was issued by project director of the Post Crisis Need Assessment (PCNA), said the contract signed between the Governance and Policy Project and Sohail Ayaz on Nov 1, 2017, was terminated with an immediate effect in pursuance of Clause 12 of the contract due to engagement of the consultant in fraudulent practices and immoral activities.

After deportation from the UK on the completion of jail term, Ayaz managed to secure job in the provincial government’s project under the health and planning and development departments and worked undetected for around four years until he was arrested in Rawalpindi in a similar case.

In a confessional video widely shared on social media, the accused admitted raping at least 30 boys.

Officials claim Ayaz was hired ‘purely on merit’, his deportation from UK over paedophile sex offences not known

The relevant officials told Dawn that Ayaz worked in the World Bank-funded projects in both health and P&D departments. A health department official said the accused was hired as a financial consultant with the revitalisation of health services in KP.

“He (Ayaz) was hired by a committee headed by the health secretary after the post was advertised and the WB issued him a no objection certificate,” he said.

Officials in the P&D department said the accused had previously worked at the health department and joined the Governance and Policy Project (GPP), a donor-funded project under the Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF).

The official said the accused was hired as a public-private partnership specialist in 2017.

His contract with the GPP dated Nov 2017 said he would be paid Rs3.4 million for his services from Nov 1, 2017 to Oct 31, 2018.

In his application to the GPP coordinator, the accused claims working for more than a dozen high-profile humanitarian organisations, UN and other donor agencies.

Strangely, INGO Save the Children, from whose London offices he was arrested on the charges of sexual offenses against children and child pornography, is missing from that list. The accused also claims that he has international and field experience in Afghanistan, UAE, Turkey, Syria, Pakistan and Iraq under challenging and post-conflict environment on project contracts and financial management. Officials in GPP said the accused was a workaholic type, who only minded his own business, and was a timid sort of person.

“It is really embarrassing for us,” a senior official said.

Another senior official insisted that lies were being propagated about Ayaz’s hiring as he was not hired on ‘parchi’.

“His (Ayaz’s) hiring was made on purely on merit,” he said.

The official said the project had no means to know a candidate’s past and it was rather difficult to engage lengthy inquiries about one’s past in short-term appointments.

“It’s the job of the Federal Investigation Agency to do something about him (Ayaz) after he was deported from the UK,” he said.

The official said he and other staff members felt revulsion after seeing news reports about the accused.

“Whatever he has done is against Islam, humanity and culture. He should be punished for his wrongdoings,” he said.

Both the KP Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Rules, 2014, and KP Project Policy, 2008, are silent about any background check of the consultant and mostly focus on professional competence of the applicant for the job on offer.

The KPPRA rules declare that whenever short-listing is deemed necessary, the procuring entity shall pre-determine criteria for short-listing.

According to them, except for single source, there will normally be a minimum of three consultants in the short-list, but there is no upper limit for number of candidates to be short-listed. However, if less than three candidates apply; their proposals may be considered on merit.

The rules say procuring entity while short-listing consultants may take the following factors into consideration, namely: (a) qualification; (b) general experience; or (c) specific experience, particularly of the last five years; or (d) any other factor that a procuring entity may deem relevant, not inconsistent with these rules.

Similarly, the KP Project Policy, 2008, which deals with appointment in development projects, does not mention any background check while making project staff hiring. Section 3(iv) which deals with procedures to fill the post states that, “the scrutiny will be carried out in the light of record furnished by the applicant with particular reference to his academic qualification, experience, professional skills, age limits and other conditions advertised for the post.”

A source said the project’s policy mostly dealt with hiring in government-own development projects, while in case of donors involvement, their policies also came into play.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1542082,3/19/20 7:19,Preventing abuse,"CHILD abuse and neglect include both commission of physical, sexual and psychological abuse and omission in failing to provide emotional, educational needs and protection from harm. Too often, incidents of child abuse surface, leading to public outcry and arrests of perpetrators, and then everybody retreats to their corner.

The recently passed Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Act (ZARRA) is perhaps the first instance by the state of truly recognising the severity and urgency of this issue. All the same, three nagging questions remain: (i) what are the main causes of such incidents recurring; (ii) can ZARRA adequately prevent such incidents; (iii) what simultaneous steps can state and society take to create a safe, stable and nurturing environment for children?

First, it must be understood that child abuse cases are significantly unreported, especially those of minor girls, owing to the social stigma attached to being a victim. Despite being a flashpoint for child abuse in the news, in Kasur district, for example, only 79 cases of child abuse (including rape and sodomy of minors) involving 94 accused persons were lodged in 2019. Fifty-nine cases of attempted rape and sodomy cases involving 62 accused persons were also lodged.

Second, perpetrators of these heinous crimes are often themselves victims of abuse during childhood. During police investigation, the accused in the Zainab and Chunian rape-murder cases both revealed that they were raped as children. When a child is abused at such an early age, it can leave indelible marks on their psyche.

The Zainab alert law is a positive step, albeit with some flaws.

Third, in almost all these cases, predators find easy targets among poor victims; the more in need, the easier it is to entice them with paltry sums of money or other gifts. Even Zainab was lured away in such a manner.

And fourth, barring the occasional media frenzy, our society is generally apathetic and desensitised towards the issue of child abuse. Perpetrators are viewed simply as psychopathic or monstrous outliers instead of people hidden in plain sight.

The recently passed ZARRA is an encouraging step. The act is a much-needed attempt to chalk out an institutional response. It is holistic and integrated in the sense that it involves more than one department in the recovery of missing and abducted children. On the response level, it constitutes a dedicated agency with an early warning system — helpline 1099 — to report cases. Convicted offenders will now be sentenced to at least 10 years behind bars, up to a maximum of life imprisonment. But still its approach is reactionary and severe. There are few areas that need further improvement.

First, ZARRA altogether fails to address child abuse prevention. Incarceration alone cannot act as an effective deterrent in the absence of an overarching and efficient preventive mechanism, which has been ignored. Second, rehabilitation of victims after their release from hostile custody is an area that also needs attention.

Then, the law envisages an alert system along the lines of the US Amber Alert, which was named after a nine-year-old girl who was abducted and subsequently killed in Texas in 1996. The alert system has yielded a significant number of recoveries of lost children in the US. However, replicating the same model in Pakistan doesn’t necessarily guarantee the same results. In fact, the dynamics of our society are different.

The alert system works well in urban societies with an extensively integrated service structure. If ZARRA is instantaneously circulated to the general public as outlined in Article 5(a) of the act, it will create more panic and insecurity, and in the bargain be of little help, if at all. Information concerning the descriptions of missing children should be shared among concerned quarters only — related government departments, intelligence agencies and the population of a specific area.

In order to forestall incidents of child abuse, state and society should collectively step up efforts. At a societal level, it starts primarily with positive parenting in a family where children are provided care and nurtured at home. They are taught the difference between appropriate and inappropriate exposure and contact. They are closely monitored in the company of non-immediate relatives, family friends and in seminaries.

At a state level, a more aggressive and thoughtful response is needed; local police must devise a surveillance mechanism to check the activities of desperate, unemployed, notorious elements in society, especially those involved in child abuse incidents in the past, as well as places like internet cafés, snooker clubs, mechanic workshops and ill-reputed seminaries.

To protect its citizens from any assault is the fundamental duty of the state. A state cannot afford ignorance, nor can it allow its citizens’ lives to be ruined by predators.

Too often, incidents of child abuse surface, leading to public outcry and arrests of perpetrators, and then everybody retreats to their corner.
First, it must be understood that child abuse cases are significantly unreported, especially those of minor girls, owing to the social stigma attached to being a victim.
Despite being a flashpoint for child abuse in the news, in Kasur district, for example, only 79 cases of child abuse (including rape and sodomy of minors) involving 94 accused persons were lodged in 2019.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1113127,6/16/14 17:55,Britain bans forced marriage,"LONDON: British legislation banning forced marriage came into effect on Monday, with those found guilty of the largely hidden practice facing up to seven years in prison.

The law applies not only within Britain but also makes it a criminal offence to force a British national into a marriage abroad, as many youngsters are flown out to weddings in their ancestral homelands, particularly in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.

Nearly two-thirds of the cases dealt with by the government's Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) relate to Britain's South Asian communities.

Campaigners welcomed the new laws as a “huge step forward”, while the government hopes they will protect potential victims.

A practice wrecking the lives of unknown thousands of British-born youths, forced marriage has been increasingly exposed in the last decade.

“Forced marriage is a tragedy for each and every victim, and its very nature means that many cases go unreported,” said Home Secretary Theresa May.

“I am proud to say that the UK is already a world leader in the fight to stamp out this harmful practice with the government's FMU working hard to tackle this terrible practice in the UK and overseas.

“Today's criminalisation is a further move by this government to ensure victims are protected by the law and that they have the confidence, safety and the freedom to choose. “Last year, the FMU dealt with some 1,300 cases, 18 per cent of them men.

Forty per cent of victims were aged 17 or under; three quarters were aged under 22.

Officials fear the number of victims coming forward is just the tip of the iceberg.

Meanwhile charities say few leaders with influence in their communities are prepared to take a stand, for fear of losing their support base.

The cases related to 74 different countries, although 43 per cent were linked to Pakistan, 11 per cent to India and 10 per cent to Bangladesh.

Other countries with multiple cases included Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iran and Tunisia.

The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said children as young as 12 had contacted them about forced marriage, with the numbers calling up two-thirds in the last year.

The charity's Ash Chand called the new law “a huge step forward which we hope will deter those plotting against their own children.

“Many young people who call our ChildLine service about this issue are frightened, concerned and feel control of their lives is being wrenched from them. “","['Salim A', 'Moiz Omar', 'Mohammad Akhtar', 'Hani Abidi', 'Dr Abdul Shakoor Bhatti', 'Dr. Sehar Khan', 'Gerry Carman', 'Usman Khalid', 'Jude Allen', 'Sharjeel Bin Afzal']","LONDON: British legislation banning forced marriage came into effect on Monday, with those found guilty of the largely hidden practice facing up to seven years in prison.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1508076,9/30/19 6:54,"50 women, 28 men fall victim to karo-kari across Sindh in six months","KARACHI: Amid so many challenges faced by the law enforcement agencies and the criminal justice system, killings in the name of so-called honour, or karo-kari killings, mainly in rural parts of Sindh, continue unabated as more than 70 people have lost their lives during the first six months of the current year, it emerged on Sunday.

However, investigations into majority of such cases remain inconclusive bringing no one to justice but have allowed acquittal of a few suspects.

Official figures suggested that some 78 people were killed from January to June 2019 in different parts of Sindh in the name of karo-kari leading to registration of 65 cases. However, more than 90 per cent cases were pending trial due to different reasons and in most cases the police probe had not reached to a conclusion.

Total 65 cases have been registered but no one convicted for killing in the name of so-called honour

“Among 78 victims, 50 were women and 28 men,” said a source citing the data. “Total 65 FIRs have been registered in different parts of Sindh for honour killings and charge sheets in 60 cases filed. Some 57 cases are still pending with no conviction in any case. However, three people have been acquitted during the process. In most cases the suspects are close relatives of the victims.”

The concern in the police hierarchy over the status of investigations into honour killing cases echoed in a recent meeting chaired by Inspector General of Police Dr Syed Kaleem Imam, who last month reviewed the progress made by police in their assignments related to karo-kari.

IGP seeks detailed report

The Sindh IG had asked investigators to prepare a detailed report on a case-to-case basis about the release and conviction in the honour killing cases across the province.

He also directed the officials concerned to ensure that there must not be any loophole left in the investigations and the same was also adequately pursued before courts.

In the same meeting, the DIG-Sukkur was asked to take on board all stakeholders and with their consultation a proposal be developed to help end the menace of karo-kari.

Despite being highly criticised by the authorities as well as human rights organisations, the heinous trend, usually termed a part of the rural system, continues unabated. Police, however, find it hard to investigate such killings effectively, as both aggrieved and accused parties usually belong to the same family or tribe.

“Honour killing is a social problem and has its roots in the tribal culture and a mindset where women are seen as subservient to men,” said DIG-Headquarters Abdul Khaliq Shaikh.

DIG Shaikh has been heading the recently established human rights cell of the Sindh police that operates as a supervisory body responsible for focusing and emphasising safeguarding human rights while primarily dealing with cases pertaining to vulnerable communities that include women, children, minorities and transgenders.

“A long-term solution lies in changing this mindset and empowering women in society in general. As far as the criminal justice response is concerned the police department has taken several useful initiatives to deal with the menace of killings in the name of so-called honour which included execution of a project on prevention of honour killings in collaboration with UNDP and a training module for police officers have been developed to sensitise them,” he added.

He said that a centralised human rights cell had been established in the Central Police Office (CPO) to monitor such incidents or cases and the IGP had got conducted a research study by senior police officers to assess the police response and identify ways and means to improve police handling of cases.

“However, there’s a need for greater coordination between prosecution, police and judiciary as prosecutors and judges need to be trained to understand peculiarities of murder cases where motive is [so-called] honour,” said DIG Shaikh.

Call for reforming criminal justice system

Both human rights organisations and legislators, however, believe that apart from the flaw in the probe and attitude of the families concerned, the police’s approach towards the ‘honour killing’ cases and overall criminal justice system need reforms.

They call for greater reforms in the laws and bringing the culprits to justice instead of blaming the culture for the brutal trend.

“In the first place, you have to treat all crime equally — if its murder then its murder,” said PPP leader Dr Nafisa Shah, who has a PhD degree in social and cultural anthropology from Oxford University.

Ms Shah’s 2017 book Honour Unmasked offers rich detailed ethnography on honour killing, sowing how the state and justice system and informal processes of redress are mutually implicated in providing a space for honour-related violence.

“When it comes to law related to this subject, it’s unfortunate these laws are quite vague. They are needed to be reformed. We witnessed some legal changes first during General Musharraf government and then during the last government of Nawaz Sharif. But it needs to address whole criminal justice and one can’t blame culture or trend just for an excuse.”

She said that the changes made in the laws during two different government to address the menace of honour killings should be counted effective if there was any decline in number of such cases but this could only be called as a step forward, not a solution.

“Since all cases fall in the domain of law, we need to look at the perspective of the law,” said Dr Shah. “We need to see that how are these cases dealt with? Whatever changes were made in the law, I believe these all were partial changes. We need to look and reform the criminal justice system for better and effective results.”

A police official said the father of the victim got registered an FIR under sections 53/377 of the Child Protection Act in the city police station.

He told police that when he returned home from a nearby mosque after offering evening prayers his wife informed him their son had gone to bring milk from a nearby shop, but he returned empty-handed while weeping.

The complainant told the police that when they removed his trousers they saw blood stains on his body.

Upon inquiry, the child revealed that when he went out of the house an accused namely Uzair offered him Rs20 along with some candies. Then he took him to wheat fields where he forcibly assaulted him. The boy said that the alleged rapist warned him against revealing the incident to anyone, or he would be killed.

Khalid shot dead his sister Sadiqeen, 26, after allegedly finding her in an ""objectionable position"" in a room with a 70-year-old man named Rafiqullah, Station House Officer (SHO) Sher Hassan said.

After killing his sister, a mother of two, Khalid shot dead Rafiqullah as well.

The suspect escaped after committing the crime.

A First Information Report (FIR) has been lodged against Khalid and his cousin, Umar Bacha, the police official said.

Hundreds of women are murdered every year in Pakistan, often by their own relatives, for going against their families' wishes in matters of love and marriage.

The perpetrators of so-called honour killings — in which the victim, normally a woman, is killed by a relative — often walk free because they can seek forgiveness for the crime from another family member.

The Aurat Foundation’s annual report of 2016 showed 7,852 cases of violence against women.

According to Saima Munir, who works for Aurat Foundation, there has been a 70 per cent increase in honour killings in the past year.","['Umar Bacha', 'Naveed Iqbal', 'Images Staff', 'Khurram Husain', 'F.S.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1588335/outrage-at-forced-marriages-of-underage-girls,11/3/20 7:40,Outrage at forced marriages of underage girls,"LAHORE: Women belonging to religious minorities have expressed outrage and condemnation at, what they say, the abduction and forced marriage of ‘minor’ Arzoo Raja in Karachi.

The Minority Women’s Forum (MWF) slammed the underage marriages of girls, especially those from religious minorities, in Pakistan who were abducted and made to change their religion.

“Under the Child Marriage Restraint Act this amounts to statutory rape,” said one of the members of the platform. “The case of Aarzoo Raja, which has recently gained traction is just the tip of the iceberg, but it brings attention to the multiple vulnerabilities of minor girls belonging to religious minorities who suffer the cross-sectional issues arising from social divisions based on class, caste, religion, and gender.”

She said various research studies have repeatedly explained disastrous consequences of underage marriages on the health of the girl child, especially if she has children and her deprivation from education which is a basic right.

“We believe in religious freedom so conversion out of free will is not the problem,” she said. “But if a girl is being abducted and forced to make a statement this is a social evil which has to be eliminated. There are several cases of other underage children who have had to suffer this.”

The Child Marriage Restraint Act must be implemented, she said.

The MWF also demanded comprehensive legal and policy measures at national and provincial levels to stop forced conversions and subsequent marriages of minority minor girls and to ensure that any religious conversion was done without any pressure and with free will as well as comprehensive anti-discrimination measures, legislative, policy and administrative initiatives to protect and promote the human rights of religious minorities, particularly of minority women and girls who often become victims of abduction, rape, forced religious conversion and underage marriage.

Also, the Cecils & Iris Chaudhry Foundation (CICF) also released a statement in the aftermath of the Arzoo Raja case, saying that with regard to the recent videos where Arzoo, 13, stating that she was not kidnapped and neither was she forced to convert to Islam, nor was she forcefully married to 44-year-old Ali Azhar and that it all happened with her consent, it could not be emphasized enough that Arzoo is only a minor, and a child.

“They can brainwash her to say anything,” said Michelle Chaudhry. “We have witnessed adults being brainwashed to carry out all kinds of violence, so what stops a child from being brainwashed? A 13-year-old child has no consent in this regard and neither does the law permit it. It is illegal to marry her, and subject her to sexual abuse and rape.”

Ms Chaudhry said that the child and all other such children must be handed back to their parents.

“In the garb of forcing children to convert to Islam and marrying them, pedophiles such as these abductors, are functioning with impunity. It is about time the government intervenes and puts an end to this. Our children need state protection which is their constitutional right.”

There are several cases of other underage children who have had to suffer this.”The Child Marriage Restraint Act must be implemented, she said.","['minor', 'child', 'religious', 'outrage', 'children', 'arzoo', 'forced', 'girls', 'marriages', 'raja', 'underage', 'minorities']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd311494efe0.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd329902b790.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg', 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3134c0ceff.jpg'}",TRUE,http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'LAHORE: Women belonging to religious minorities have expressed outrage and condemnation at, what they say, the...', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1588335', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Outrage at forced marriages of underage girls', 'description': 'LAHORE: Women belonging to religious minorities have expressed outrage and condemnation at, what they say, the...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1588335', 'title': 'Outrage at forced marriages of underage girls', 'description': 'LAHORE: Women belonging to religious minorities have expressed outrage and condemnation at, what they say, the...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-11-03 07:40:56', 'modified_time': '2020-11-03 07:40:56', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/397/the-newspaper-s-staff-reporter'}, 'author': ""The Newspaper's Staff Reporter""})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1389325,2/14/18 7:11,Three handed down life term in Kasur child abuse scandal,"LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday awarded life imprisonment to three suspects in one of the cases registered against them for their involvement in the Kasur child abuse scandal of 2015.

ATC-IV judge Chaudhry Muhammad Ilyas announced the sentence in the presence of the suspects and also imposed fine of Rs500,000 each on Haseem Amir, Waseem Sindhi and Aleem Asif.

Ganda Singhwala police of Kasur had registered the cases against the suspects and others on charges of abducting and sexually assaulting around 280 children of the district. The prosecution had accused them of sexually assaulting minor boys and filming the incidents to blackmail them.

Lawyers of the suspects stated that police had implicated their clients in cases on government pressure. The suspects had no role in the child abuse incidents. They had already been convicted in some of the first information reports (FIRs) and acquitted in some others by a trial court. Police had registered nine cases against over a dozen suspects.

Previously, the court had awarded life imprisonment to Faizan Majeed and Haseem Amir in another FIR in the scandal and acquitted them in another giving benefit of the doubt.

In some of the cases, the trial court had deleted Section 7 of Anti-Terrorism Act from the FIRs and referred the trials of the suspects to sessions court. However, the Lahore High Court on the appeal of the prosecution set aside the decision and restored the terrorism provision.

ZAINAB CASE: The lawyer of Kasur serial killer withdrew his power of attorney after the suspect confessed to raping and killing nine minor girls, including seven-year-old Zainab Amin.

“I accepted the brief of Imran Ali as he insisted on his innocence,” said Advocate Mehar Shakeel Multani talking to the media outside Kot Lakhpat jail where an ATC was holding trial of the suspect.

He told the media that he withdrew his power of attorney since the suspect had confessed to the crime in court. “I have been misled by the suspect,” he said, adding that he could not defend a criminal.

Meanwhile, ATC judge Sajjad Ahmad recorded statements of 16 more prosecution witnesses during an 11-hour jail trial.

The court is holding the trial on a day-to-day basis to conclude the case within a week as ordered by the Lahore High Court.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1558404,5/20/20 6:56,JIT formed to probe Waziristan honour killings,"MIRAMSHAH: The Bannu regional police officer has constituted a four-member joint investigation team for probing the honour killing of two teenage girls, whose ‘objectionable’ video went viral lately.

The police have so far arrested four suspects, including the video recorder and the one, released on social media.

North Waziristan district police officer Shafiullah Gandapur will supervise the JIT, whose members include DSP Shahid Adnan, sub-inspectors Mir Sahib Khan and Mohammad Nawaz and assistant sub-inspector Farman Ali.

DPO Gandapur told reporters that the police had arrested Umer Ayaz, who had recorded the video and was seen in it; Fida Mohammad, a friend of Umer Ayaz with whom he had shared the video and suspected him of making it viral; father of one of the girls, Radwal Khan, and a cousin of the girls Roohuddin.

He said the alleged killer, Mohammad Aslam, who was also a cousin of the girls aged 16 and 18 respectively, had gone into hiding and the police were making efforts for his early arrest.

Video recorder among four held, suspected killer at large

The DPO said the police had also contacted cybercrime wing of the Federal Investigation Agency with a request for the deletion of the objectionable video from different websites.

He said the central character, Umer Ayaz, 28, was married and had two children.

Mr Gandapur said as the family had been keeping the issue a secret, it was a challenging case for the police.

“None of the family members had approached the police, so the SHO registered the FIR of the occurrence as the complainant,” he said.

The DPO said provincial police officer Sanaullah Abbasi was taking keen interest in the case. He said the district police were in contact with Karachi police for the tracing of the suspected killer as he used to live there before the killings.

Mr Gandapur said another woman seen in the 52 seconds video was the suspected killer’s wife, who seemed to be spared by the family, as she wasn’t found to be doing anything objectionable.

He said the girls’ family had migrated from South Waziristan area due to the Rah-i-Nijat military operation against militants before settling in Shamplan Garyam village of North Waziristan area.

The DPO added that the family of the deceased girls claimed that the video was filmed around a year ago.

He said Umer Ayaz revealed during investigation that he had only shared the video with friend Fida Mohammad, so he was suspected of making the video viral on social media.

The DPO added that due to sensitivity of the issue, the JIT comprised trained police officers to look into every aspect of the killings.

The girls were killed on May 14, while the Razmak police station registered its FIR on May 15. Initially, the FIR included Section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code but later, Pakistan Penal Code’s Section 311 dealing with fasad fil ard (mischief on earth) and Section 201 (causing of the disappearance of evidence) and Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act’s Section 19 (unauthorised interception of a transmission) were included in it.

The Puran Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Zerab Gul told Dawn that the girl's brothers suspected the two were involved in a relationship and subsequently killed them in the name of 'honour'.

The SDPO said that the two were first cousins. The girl was unmarried, while the man, Said Muhammad, had four children.

Zerab Gul said that the murdered man's father, Khan Said, told police that his two nephews had shot his son dead while Said Muhammad was working in the fields.

Khan Said alleged that after killing his son, the brothers went home and killed their teenage sister, police said.

The suspects then fled the crime scene, the SDPO added.

Locals told Dawn that a jirga of elders had, one week ago, decided that the girl and man suspected of being in a relationship should marry each other.

Khan Said confirmed that a first information report had been registered in the Martung police station.

The SDPO said that the case was registered under Sections 302 and 311 of the Pakistan Penal Code. An initial investigation is underway, he said.","['Umar Bacha', 'Ahmed Bin Babar', 'Jawahar Colony', 'Najma Hisham', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1371109,11/17/17 16:03,"PTV current affairs director sacked after allegations of harassment, misuse of authority","Pakistan Television (PTV) on Friday sacked its suspended director of current affairs, Agha Masood Shorish, following allegations of sexual harassment and misuse of authority by multiple staffers at the state-run broadcaster.

A total of five inquiries had been initiated against Shorish, including three for sexual harassment. PTV's 14 producers had also filed a complaint against him in the Islamabad High Court, and the issue was also taken up in the National Assembly.

Shorish, who was suspended three months ago for negligence, had continued to receive his salary and all other benefits during his suspension period. He also officially retired around a decade ago after reaching the age of superannuation.

The executive also reportedly used PTV's legal resources to defend himself in the court even though the organisation was not a party in the case.

The Information Ministry issued a notification for his termination after participants of a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi decided to remove officers who were bringing a bad name to state-owned organisations, were posted even after retirement or had caused financial harm to them, sources said.

Tanzeela Mazhar, a former PTV employee who was among the main complainants against Shorish said in a tweet on Friday: ""Finally, [the] darkest chapter of harassment, corruption and nepotism is closed. Thank you everyone who stood by us to make this happen.""

She thanked PPP lawmakers Saeed Ghani and Shazia Marri, and multiple TV anchors for their support.

Marri had moved a calling attention notice regarding complaints by Mazhar and her fellow anchor Yashfeen Jamal earlier this year in the NA upon which the State Minister for Information Marriyum Aurangzeb had said that an unbiased committee would investigate the matter.

Mazhar had resigned from PTV later, since she said she could not keep drawing a salary without being given work by the PTV.

“I resigned because the man in question was reinstated,"" Tanzeela Mazhar had told Dawn.com earlier.

""Even though our contracts were renewed, we were not being given air time. To take a government salary but not work was unacceptable to me,” she had said.

“When I raised my voice, people responded with [degrading] comments about women, and our character and personal lives, without understanding that what we do in our private lives is a private matter,” Mazhar said while speaking of the reprisals to a social media campaign she ran against the man in question.

“I plan to raise awareness about what harassment is, as most people do not take it seriously until a person has been beaten up or raped,” Mazhar added.","['Shakeel Qarar', 'Waqas Ahmad', 'Saeed Uz Zaaman', 'Ejaz Khan', 'Siva D', 'Abdul Rahman Khan', 'Salman Syed', 'Naseer Ahmed', 'Rafia Sukhera', 'Azam A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1571736,7/29/20 7:05,Saving the children,"PROMISED a good life, to be ‘treated as family’, and given wholesome meals, decent wages and access to education, the reality for many millions of domestic child workers in Pakistan is just the opposite.

Domestic servitude puts children’s well-being at risk. They are made to work from sunrise to sunset, fed leftovers, allowed little rest and are locked up and brutally beaten.

Earlier in May, eight-year-old Zohra Shah’s employers allegedly beat her up so badly that she died of her injuries for releasing the household’s prized parrots from a cage. In 2019, a 16-year-old domestic worker Uzma Bibi was brutally tortured and murdered for helping herself to a small piece of meat. In 2018, 10-year old Tayyaba’s bruised face was all over social media.

While not all child domestic workers are treated as severely, the ILO considers domestic work hazardous. It exposes children to violence, abuse, sexual abuse and long hours of work while denying them access to healthcare and education.

Domestic labour puts the child’s well-being at risk.

It is illegal to employ children under 18 in factories and other service industries, but except for Punjab there is no law banning them from working inside homes. And thus this shroud of invisibility provides the perfect impunity to employers to perpetrate violence till the time a case like Zohra Shah’s surfaces.

Then the entire country goes into some kind of collective retribution. Social media highlights abuse by employers, hashtags call for justice for the victim or survivor; the police get into action and arrest the alleged perpetrators; mainstream electronic media flash ‘breaking news’; newspapers publish editorials; and Pakistani legislators, celebrities and influencers send messages with sentiments ranging from shock and anger to anguish. Often this outrage subsides as quickly as it erupts. Zohra Shah was forgotten even before she was quietly buried in her village of Muzaffargarh. Few seem interested in following up on the pressure the parents of such children often face from employers to quash the case or keep quiet in exchange for ‘hush’ money.

However, things seem to be looking up this time around. While the adults have been dilly-dallying for years over this issue, this time the youth of Pakistan have taken it upon themselves to end the scourge.

The campaign to end child domestic labour, initiated by Idare-e-Taleem-o-Aagahi (ITA) last month may have found traction with 20 rights-based Pakistani organisations, but it is the youth who seem to be this campaign’s backbone. Aged between 10 to 18 and belonging to all strata and school systems from across the country, they have stepped in to end what is so normalised in Pakistani society and which one young student terms as nothing but ‘child abuse’.

But along with bringing about a mindset change, it is time to look at how the country’s law is protecting its children.

For instance, there is some confusion in the statute book that needs to be cleared. Section 328-A of the Pakistan Penal Code gives the child ample protection, Section 89 of the same PPC allows parents, guardians and teachers to use corporal punishment in “good faith”.

While good laws need stricter implementation, certain existing ones need amendments. According to Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari, the 1991 Employment of Children Act needs to be amended to include child domestic labour among the list of proscribed jobs considered hazardous and banned for children under 14.

The ITA wants to make it even more watertight by proposing a constitutional amendment in Article 11(3) prohibiting all children under 16 from engaging in any form of labour, in any capacity. Those between the ages of 16 and 18 may work, but only in non-hazardous occupati­ons, with well-defined codes of working conditions, and hours and wages stipulated in a written contract.

But even before all the tweaking of law is carried out, the contradictions within the country’s Constitution and the Penal Code about the legal age of a child needs to be addressed. Article 25A of the Constitution that makes the state responsible to provide free and compulsory education terms a child to be anywhere between the ages of five to 16 years; Article 11 disallows slavery, forced labour, human trafficking and hazardous employment for children under the age of 14.

Presently, the only province that prohibits child domestic labour is Punjab with its Punjab Domestic Workers Act, 2019. But cam­­­paigners say it is weak in addressing child domestic labour as it only prohibits children under 15 from being employed and the violators get away as neither punishment nor fine are tough enough. Further, the violators cannot be arrested by police. It is time other pro­vinces followed suit while the legal loopholes that exist in the Punjab law must be closed.

While laws will be crafted, in the end it is society itself that can end this practice by disabusing itself of the notion that it is doing poor families a good turn by hiring their children.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1297076,11/18/16 6:32,Call for awareness to help end gender-based violence,"PESHAWAR: Participants of a stakeholder dialogue on gender-based violence and child protection’ have said there is a dire need to combat gender-based violence through community awareness with a focus on religious and community elders.

The event was organised by NGO Struggle for Change (Sach) here in collaboration with the UNHCR on Thursday.

The event was attended by acting chief of the Child Protection Commission Ijaz Mohammad Khan, and representatives of UNHCR and governmental and nongovernmental organisations.

Sach task manager Awaisur Rehman said his organisation was committed to working for the rights of the victims of violence and torture.

He also shared the service, activities and work of Sach for refugees.

UNHCR assistant protection officer Bushra Attaullah highlighted her organisation’s mandate and International Protection Framework - Rights of Refugees and IDPs in context of the status of registered Afghans and displaced persons.

A discussion on gender-based violence and child protection was facilitated by Sach trainer Imran Takkar, who said gender-based violence was deeply rooted in regions like South Asia.

“Stereotyping women and discrimination against them is even more dangerous and terrifying in Afghanistan and Pakistan,” he said.

Mr. Takkar said the gender-based violence was persistent in Afghan communities and that gender discrimination was a harsh tragedy with the woman presumed the weaker sex both in Pakistani and Afghani society.

He added that women were expected to be submissive and dependent while man was believed to be active, aggressive and independent, which was why man always dominated the woman.

The trainer said women were also kept unaware of their basic human rights, making them vulnerable to oppression.

He said 87 percent of Afghan women experienced at least one form of physical, sexual or psychological violence, and 62 percent experienced multiple forms.

“These figures reflect the immense challenges that women face, and the dire need for change at every level from policy to service provision to community understanding,” he said.

The trainer said in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the causes of violence were due to deep-rooted social and cultural values.

“Sadly, women facing discrimination and violence do not get a great deal of support from society and government. It is the duty of government to formulate gender-sensitive policies in collaboration with the civil society so that crimes against women can be minimised. Such policies will also help in changing the attitude of the people in the long run,” he said.

Sach project coordinator Shazia Azhar said healthy discussions would serve as a framework to develop better understandings about gender-based violence and child protection.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1571280,7/27/20 7:07,Government College University VC in Lahore orders probe into sexual harassment case,"LAHORE: Following a sexual harassment complaint made on behalf of a student against a teacher of Physics Department of the Government College University, Lahore, the vice chancellor ordered an inquiry into the matter on Sunday.

A member of the Old Ravian Facebook group had posted screenshots and pictures of a teacher of the GCU Physics Department, and alleged quoting a student that she and her friends were repeatedly failed by the teacher in examinations and were also sexually harassed by him.

According to the Facebook post, the group member said he decided to speak on behalf of the student who alleged the teacher wanted to remain in contact with her and her friends.

In the post the teacher was accused of compelling the students to attend his video calls. It said that on Saturday, the teacher called one of the students who “decided to expose him” and took some screenshots in which he was “shirtless and apparently drunk”.

It says when the student turned off her Wi-Fi after taking the screenshots, the teacher started making calls on her mobile number and had sent messages asking her to attend the call.

The post includes call logs, messages and screenshots of video calls, demanding the Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Asghar Zaidi to take notice of the incident.

Meanwhile, the vice chancellor Prof Zaidi also received complaints about a faculty member of the university making inappropriate calls and messages to a female student and ordered an inquiry into the matter. For the purpose, he constituted a committee that also included a woman member.

He said that as a matter of principle harassment would not be tolerated at the GCU.

Prof Zaidi said a web portal (Vice Chancellor web portal) had been created by varsity since February 2020 for filing such complaints by students and staff.

He said the university would not further comment on this matter till conclusion of the inquiry.

He directed the probe committee to maintain the confidentiality of the matter and provide full protection to the complainant.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1302057,12/12/16 16:32,Mob 'besieging' Ahmadi place of worship in Chakwal dispersed by police,"A charged mob of around 1,000 people which reportedly besieged an Ahmadi place of worship in Chakwal was dispersed by police on Monday, officials said.

The place of worship located in the limits of the Chowas Saidan Shah police station area in Chakwal's Dhalmial district was 'attacked' by nearly 1,000 people, according to the Jamaat-i-Ahmaddiya Pakistan Spokesperson Saleem-ud-Din.

Saleem-ud-Din said a mob armed with batons and weapons was throwing stones and firing on the premises. The mob was ""attempting to seize Ahmadiyya property,"" he said.

Deputy Commissioner Chakwal Mahmood Javed Bhatti said the mob hurled stones and bricks at the place of worship before storming the building, adding that gunmen opened fire on Ahmadis in the area. The DC said that police have now dispersed the crowd and secured the building.

Rashid Ahmad, a local police official, said the mob also set fire to part of the building.

Station House Officer Chowas Saidan Shah Sub Inspector (SI) Muhammad Nawaz told Dawn that police had dispersed the crowd. The situation is under control now, he confirmed, adding that police had not decided on what action to take.

District police officer Chakwal said that a dialogue between local religious leaders and district administration is ongoing.

SI Muhammad Nawaz added that there had been no reports of any casualties.

The Jamaat-i-Ahmaddiya Pakistan spokesperson, however, claimed that there had been one killed in the incident, but was unable to identify the dead.

The Government of Punjab earlier said it was ""following up"" on the Chakwal incident.

The provincial government's Twitter claimed, ""As per details, a misunderstanding developed between the two groups. Home Department is vigilantly following up the issue.""

It is unclear which groups were involved in the incident.

He said parents were hesitant to bring cases of child abuse to the fore due to social and other reasons.","['child', 'mera', 'children', 'app', 'instructs', 'minister', 'abuse', 'cases', 'bachcha', 'progress', 'prime', 'creation']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30374b43a7.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2014/12/54a09ed2a377a.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/10/5d93823ab050c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/09/5d845e84abd85.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/09/5d845e84abd85.jpg?r=560419867', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/10/5d93823ab050c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2019/10/5d940da788098.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/10/5d940da788098.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd309b711467.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd306ee076b9.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2014/12/54a09ed2a377a.png'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2019/10/5d940da788098.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'According to a PMO press release, the ""Mera Bachcha Alert"" app will be created in two weeks.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1508486', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'PM instructs creation of child abuse app', 'description': 'According to a PMO press release, the ""Mera Bachcha Alert"" app will be created in two weeks.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2019/10/5d940da788098.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1508486', 'title': 'PM instructs creation of child abuse app', 'description': 'According to a PMO press release, the ""Mera Bachcha Alert"" app will be created in two weeks.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2019/10/5d940da788098.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2019-10-02 07:04:43', 'modified_time': '2019-10-02 07:39:16', 'tag': 'Violence against children', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/397/the-newspaper-s-staff-reporter'}, 'keywords': 'Violence against children', 'news_keywords': 'Violence against children', 'author': ""The Newspaper's Staff Reporter""})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1200370,8/14/15 6:31,Three more cases of child abuse surface,"MULTAN/MUZAFFARGARH/SHEIKHUPURA: Three cases of sexual abuse of children surfaced in Multan, Muzaffargarh and Sheikhupura areas while five suspects were arrested in two of the cases on Thursday.

In the first incident, a child was sexually abused in the Mumtazabad area of Multan while police claimed to have arrested three suspects involved in the case and making video of the act.

A resident of Mumtazabad submitted a complaint to police that some people had raped his son and also made a video. The suspects were blackmailing him with the threat to sell the video in the market, he added.

The police, after lodging the case, arrested three of the nominated suspects.

According to an official handout, City Police Officer Azhar Ikram while taking action on the complaint directed the Mumtazabad police to arrest the remaining suspects without delay. He also constituted a police team that was conducting raids to arrest the remaining suspects.

Videos were made in two cases; five suspects arrested

In the second incident, a 12-year-old boy was gang-raped at village Dabbi Shah of Muzaffargarh and police arrested two persons allegedly involved in the crime and recording its footage on mobile phones.

A man told Mahmood Kot police his son went to the village shop on Aug 9 where the two men asked him to accompany them to the nearby fields for picking dates. When he went there, both the suspects held him at knifepoint in the sugarcane field and raped him. He alleged the suspects had uploaded the video to others’ mobile phones besides selling it in the market.

The complainant said the police had delayed registering the case.

Talking to Dawn, District Police Officer Muhammad Awais said the case had been registered and both suspects had been arrested.

In the third incident, a 13-year-old boy was allegedly molested by three people in Pathan Colony in the Ferozewala Police Station area in Sheikhupura district.

The victim was going home when the suspects forcibly took him to a barren place and raped him. They escaped after leaving the boy in an unconscious condition.

Ferozewala police registered a case on the report of the victim’s father and started investigation with no arrest so far.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1108900,5/27/14 18:04,Woman stoned to death outside Lahore High Court,"LAHORE: A 25-year-old woman was stoned to death by her family outside the Lahore High Court on Tuesday in a so-called “honour” killing for marrying the man she loved, police said.

Farzana Iqbal was waiting for the High Court in Lahore to open when a group of around dozen men began attacking her with bricks, said Umer Cheema, a senior police officer.

Her father, two brothers and former fiance were among the attackers, he said. Iqbal suffered severe head injuries and was pronounced dead in hospital, police said.

All the suspects except her father escaped. He admitted killing his daughter, Cheema said, and explained it was a matter of honour.

Cheema said Farzana had been engaged to her cousin but married another man. Her family registered a kidnapping case against him but Farzana had come to court to argue that she had married of her own free will, he said.

Arranged marriages are the norm among conservative Pakistanis, who view marriage for love as a transgression.

Around 1,000 Pakistani women are killed every year by their families in honour killings, according to Pakistani rights group the Aurat Foundation.

The true figure is probably many times higher since the Aurat Foundation only compiles figures from newspaper reports. The government does not compile national statistics.

Campaigners say few cases come to court, and those that do can take years to be heard. No one tracks how many cases are successfully prosecuted.

Even those that do result in a conviction may end with the killers walking free. Pakistani law allows a victim's family to forgive their killer.

But in honour killings, most of the time the women’s killers are her family, said Wasim Wagha of the Aurat Foundation. The law allows them to nominate someone to carry out the murder, then forgive him.

“This is a huge flaw in the law,” he said. “We are really struggling on this issue.”","['Raj Patel', 'Daniel Shiger', 'Amir Mahmood', 'Tahir A', 'Joe Fl', 'Irfan Husain', 'Ganga Din', 'Syed Fahad', 'Calcutta Man', 'Muhammed Ali']","LAHORE: A 25-year-old woman was stoned to death by her family outside the Lahore High Court on Tuesday in a so-called “honour” killing for marrying the man she loved, police said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1370114/boy-seriously-injured-in-firing-by-indian-forces,11/13/17 7:04,Boy seriously injured in firing by Indian forces,"MUZAFFARABAD: Indian firing left a young boy critically wounded in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Sunday — less than 48 hours since military officials from Pakistan and India were said to have agreed to revive the spirit of a 14-year-old ceasefire agreement between the two sides.

“Ten-year-old Umar Ajaib was injured in the Dharamsal village of Battal sector in Poonch district at about 2pm when he was playing in the courtyard of his house, unaware of [the possibility of] an attack from across the Line of Control [LoC],” said Mohammad Aziz, a police official, by telephone.

“Indian troops resorted to firing with small arms and a bullet pierced into his back, rendering him critically injured,” he said, adding that the victim was rushed to Shaikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahayan Hospital in Rawalakot. The heavily militarised LoC that splits the disputed Kashmir region has been witnessing frequent ceasefire violations for more than a year now.

However, Sunday’s casualty occurred after a considerably long gap in cross-border shelling, as the last casualties were reported on Oct 24 from the Leepa valley of Muzaffarabad division when two women were killed and six others wounded.

According to military sources, India has committed around 1,140 ceasefire violations this year — the highest number when compared to other years since November 2003 when the two armies struck the historic ceasefire agreement.

As a result of the violations, 41 civilians (24 of them men and 17 women) have lost their lives while another 247 have sustained injuries in different areas of AJK in the ongoing year, according to the State Disaster Management Authority.

On Friday, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi visited the LoC in the company of Chief of the Army Staff Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, where he strongly condemned India’s “unprofessional approach” of targeting innocent civilians from across the divide.

On the same day, the 44th biannual meeting between the Pakistan Rangers and India’s Border Security Force (BSF) had concluded in New Delhi, where loss of innocent lives as a result of ceasefire violations and unprovoked firing was also discussed, with emphasis to revive the spirit of the 2003 ceasefire agreement between the two armies to overcome this ordeal.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1455038,1/2/19 12:57,"Girls in 2011 Kohistan video were killed, Supreme Court told","Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) police have discovered that the five Kohistan girls seen cheering on two male dancers in a 2011 video were killed, the KP additional advocate general told the Supreme Court on Wednesday.

The case came to light in 2011 when reports emerged that an online video of a young man dancing before a group of teenage girls had led to murder. Five girls in the audience, as well as the man who was dancing and his two brothers, were allegedly murdered on a jirga’s orders.

Although fact-finding missions have been unable to definitively establish whether the murders took place, circumstantial and empirical evidence strongly suggest that is the case.

Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar in today's hearing recalled that the court had formed three commissions to look into the matter and inquired about what their reports had revealed.

The prosecutor told the court that imposters had been produced in place of the girls seen in the video and that the commission was misinformed that no one had been murdered.

""[Rights activist] Farzana Bari was also part of one commission, what was her point of view?"" the chief justice asked.

""Farzana Bari disagreed with the report, and now it has been proven that her suspicions were correct and the girls were murdered,"" the prosecutor said, adding that nine people have been named in the challan.

The Supreme Court ordered the prosecutor to prepare a challan and submit it within 10 days and wrapped up the case. The case is ongoing in a local court in Kohistan.

Justice Nisar, outlining the steps the victims' families could take, suggested that if they wished for the case to be heard by an anti-terrorism court, they could file an appeal in the high court.

""If the victims' families feel at any point that justice has not been served, they can file an appeal in the Supreme Court to hear the case again,"" the chief justice told a brother of one of the victims.

Background of the case

A mobile phone video shot in 2011 in the remote village of Sartai in Kohistan showed five girls ─ identified as Amina, daughter of Sarfaraz, Begum Jan d/o Mubeen, Siran Jan d/o Saeer, Bazeega, wife of Idrees, and Shaheen w/o Habibullah ─ clapping as two boys danced at a wedding. A third boy was filming the scene. The video allegedly spread among the villagers before it came to the attention of a local jirga.

The mixed gathering had taken place in a village located in an extremely conservative part of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In the eyes of the locals, the youngsters had violated tribal norms and brought dishonour upon them.

Muhammad Afzal Kohistani, the brother of one of the boys in the video, was the one who made the news public, alleging that the girls had been killed on May 30, 2012 on the orders of a cleric who led a 40-50 member tribal jirga. Officials in the area, however, had claimed that the murders did not take place and the girls were alive.

The Supreme Court that year took suo motu notice of the case in 2012 when the allegations surfaced, and women's rights activist Farzana Bari was sent to Kohistan as part of a fact-finding delegation to verify whether the girls were alive or dead.

Another rights activist, Fauzia Saeed, had said: ""We met one girl. She was identified because we carried pictures of the girls. We met another who we could not identify but people in the area said she is among the women in the video.""

The case was subsequently disposed off by the court in June 2012 after the commission recorded their statements.

Afzal Kohistani in January 2013 said he had moved an application in the Supreme Court requesting it to reopen the case. Days after the development, three of his brothers ─ including the two seen in the video ─ were shot dead on Jan 3.

A local court in 2014 was moved by the National Commission on the Status of Women against the alleged killing of the girls, and ordered police to produce the girls in court to verify that they were alive. Police, however, failed to produce the women in court, claiming that the women were alive but couldn't appear before court due to societal restrictions. Another production order was issued in April 2014.

Although a defence lawyer had earlier argued that, under local norms, it would be a matter of shame if the girls were produced in court, Justice Ejaz Afzal remarked that women have appeared as a witness in a majority of cases he had heard pertaining to Kohistan. The remoteness of the location has also made it difficult for activists to ascertain the truth.

The concerned families subsequently produced underage girls in the court to prove the claims that the girls seen in the video were alive. However, rights activist Farzana Bari disputed the claims in 2016 and said that the girls who were brought to court were not the ones seen in the video.

Bari had claimed that the girls who were earlier declared alive during the SC suo motu hearing were actually dead. Her witness statement followed a September 27, 2016 SC notice to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government and Kohistan DPO to again investigate the issue.

In her earlier statements, Bari had claimed, she had expressed serious doubts that the two girls produced before the commission were not the girls who had appeared in the said video, noting that her views were contrary to the other members' views on the issue.

She had also appended a dissenting note at that time demanding the involvement of Nadra officials in the case for positive identification of the girls to ensure that the girls produced before the commission were the same girls who appeared in the video.

The rights activist alleged that the local administration including the police had formed some kind of unholy alliance with the elected representatives of the Awami National Party to bury the issue, and demanded the girls be produced before the SC and an independent investigation team be formed to probe the issue and the alleged negligence of authorities.

A commission report submitted to the SC in Dec 2016 expressed fears that the girls may be dead: ""The view taken and expressed... is the outcome of human observations, not free from error, maybe right or wrong, and can lead to an inference that either the girls are not alive or they have fled away and gone into missing being well aware of [the] consequences of traditional approach of their elders in such case.""

The Kohistan police in August 2018 ─ seven years after the fact ─ registered an FIR of the alleged honour killings under Section 364 of the Pakistan Penal code and began probing the case again upon the Supreme Court's orders.

In Dec 2018, police claimed that four suspects arrested in November had not only confessed to the killings but also revealed that two of the five women believed to have been killed in the name of honour were alive.

""The bodies of three women killed after the marriage function video involving them went viral on the social media were thrown in Chaur Nullah by the suspects to hide their crime,"" the district police officer had said, adding that police were raiding possible hideouts of eight other suspects and expected the absconders' arrest in a few weeks. Police also seized a rifle used in the honour killing.

""We expect that two women, who are reportedly alive, will be produced before the police within few days,"" the DPO had said.","['Haseeb Bhatti', 'Major Khubaib', 'On Flip Side', 'Dr. Salaria', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Shafiq Shah', 'Farhan Shamsi', 'Baba Ladla', 'Omer Khan Shaheen', 'Images Staff']","Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) police have discovered that the five Kohistan girls seen cheering on two male dancers in a 2011 video were killed, the KP additional advocate general told the Supreme Court on Wednesday.

Finally, some 'notables' of the area forced Asif's family to marry his (Asif's) 14-year-old sister Salma to Sumera's brother Imran (25).

Police said the woman, 48, belongs to Kahuta and got married 21 years ago. Relations between the couple started getting bitter over the marriage of their elder daughter, as her husband was against the marriage.

The investigating officer, while quoting the victim’s statement, said that as the marriage date of her daughter was approaching, her husband had been behaving well, contrary to his attitude previously.

She alleged in her statement that while her daughter had gone to her relatives’ house, her husband came to her room and doused petrol on her.

After that he set her on fire. Upon hearing her screaming, her son and two of her relatives rushed to her rescue and extinguished the fire.

The victim received critical burns and was shifted to Holy Family Hospital, where she recorded her statement, which led to the registration of a case against her husband. Police said raids are underway to arrest the accused.

https://www.dawn.com/news/494732/victim-of-forced-marriage-gets-death-threats,10/6/09 0:00,Victim of forced marriage gets death threats,"LARKANA, Oct 5 Twelve-year-old Imtiaz Khatoon Chandio who was forcibly married off to Mir Hassan Chandio by her uncle has accused her uncle and relatives of Mir Hassan of issuing death threats to her and her family.

The minor girl, sitting with her father Mumtaz Chandio at the press club, told journalists on Monday that one day her uncle Panjal Chandio took her to Gul Mohammed-ji-Wandh village near Dakhan at the pretext that she would do domestic work while they were busy in rice harvesting.

Third day after her arrival in the village, she said, her uncle forcibly married her off to Mir Hassan, his (uncle's) close relative. She escaped from the village after three months and reached his father's home in Purano Ghat near old sabzi mandi, she said.

Khatoon's father alleged that his brother did not allow him to see her when he had gone to the village expressly to meet her. After she reached home, they met the DIG of Larkana Sanaullah Abbasi on Wednesday and told him her ordeal. The DIG appointed Irshad Bhutto, supervising police officer at the Haidri police station, as inquiry officer to look into her allegations.

She told the inquiry officer on Thursday that her uncle and his relatives had not only been torturing her during her stay with them but also forcing her to do all domestic chores.

One day, she alleged that Chhuttal, a policeman and brother of Mir Hassan (whom she was forcibly married off) subjected her to criminal assault.

Police have arrested Chhuttal, Panjal and Mir Hassan.

Chhuttal, the head constable, alleged that she (Imtiaz Khatoon) was a kari and had illicit relations with her cousin Mukhtiar Chandio who lived in Luhar Colony.

The girl rejected the allegation, saying that Mukhtiar was like her brother while Mukhtiar himself termed it a while lie and said Chhuttal wanted to swallow up a loan of Rs150,000 he had taken from him for house purchase.

Mr Mukhtiar told journalists that he and his family were receiving death threats and were forced to change their residence. He appealed to police high ups to provide them protection.

Our Sukkur correspondent adds Police stopped a child marriage in Pir Bux Haiderani village in the limits of Mirpur Mathelo police station late on Monday night.

According to sources, Mirpur Mathelo police raided the house of Shabaan Haiderani and took seven-year-old Rukhsana into custody after someone from the village informed them about the nikkah.

They arrested the minor bride's father Shaaban Haiderani but the minor would-be groom's father Manzoor Punjabi managed to escape with four-year-old son Rashid.

The sources said that two weeks ago Sahaaban's brother Ramzan had married Manzoor's daughter Sajida, 18, and promised to give his niece Rukhsana, Shaaban's daughter, in marriage to Manzoor's son.

Manzoor along with his son Rashid arrived in the village and asked Ramzan to fulfil his promise, said the sources, adding that Moulvi Lal Haiderani solemnised the nikkah and an elder of the community Fazal Haiderani witnessed the proceedings.

Khalil, a police official at the Mirpur Mathelo police station, categorically denied reports the nikkah had been solemnised and said the girl's father Shabaan had a matrimonial dispute with his community and his rivals had made up the nikkah story to create problems for him.

The sources, however, insisted that the nikkah had been solemnised and Moulvi Lal Haiderani and Manzoor Punjabi along with his son had escaped well before the raid.","[""The Newspaper'S Correspondent"", 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1318161,3/3/17 12:44,Mother of minor shot dead in suspected honour killing in Sanghar,"A 21-year-old woman was murdered in a case of suspected honour killing in Sindh's Sanghar district on Friday, police said.

Leela Chandio, the mother of a child, was gunned down in her village Talib Chandio within the limits of Shahdadpur police station in Sanghar.

Station House Officer (SHO) Shahdadpur Riaz Ahmed Bhutto said initial investigations showed the slain woman's husband and his cousin were involved in the murder.

According to the police official, initial investigations revealed that the cousin opened fire on the victim at the behest of her husband after they suspected her of allegedly having ""illicit relations"" with another man from the same village.

The two suspects, along with their close relatives, have reportedly moved to undisclosed locations while police teams in the area have been conducting raids to apprehend them.

Bhutto said a First Information Report (FIR) is being registered on the complaint of Abdul Karim Chandio, the victim's father.

The body of the victim was handed over to her parents after postmortem.

Speaking to a group of local journalists, Leela’s mother, Karima Chandio said her daughter was wrongly accused by her husband of having ""illicit relations"" with someone in the village.

Hundreds of women are murdered every year in Pakistan, often by their own relatives, for going against their families' wishes in matters of love and marriage.

The perpetrators of so-called honour killings often walk free because they can seek forgiveness for the crime from another family member.

The Aurat Foundation’s annual report of 2016 showed 7,852 cases of violence against women.

According to Saima Munir, who works for the Aurat Foundation, there has been a 70 per cent increase in honour killings in the past year.","['Hanif Samoon', 'Saif Zlfiqar', 'Saqib Ghumman', 'Black Dielsel', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

According to Saima Munir, who works for the Aurat Foundation, there has been a 70 per cent increase in honour killings in the past year.","['minor', 'victim', 'relations', 'showed', 'chandio', 'relatives', 'dead', 'mother', 'report', 'shot', 'shahdadpur', 'husband', 'honour', 'killing', 'sanghar', 'suspected']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2016/11/583d879d24a91.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2017/03/58b915cb85d4f.jpg?r=1286968518', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/10/57f2200f1e0c9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/11/583d879d24a91.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd329902b790.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2016/01/569c669d03ff4.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/01/569c669d03ff4.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2016/10/57f2200f1e0c9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2017/03/58b915cb85d4f.jpg?r=1286968518,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': ""Police name the victim's husband, cousin as suspects after initial investigations."", 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1318161', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Mother of minor shot dead in suspected honour killing in Sanghar', 'description': ""Police name the victim's husband, cousin as suspects after initial investigations."", 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2017/03/58b915cb85d4f.jpg?r=1286968518'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1318161', 'title': 'Mother of minor shot dead in suspected honour killing in Sanghar', 'description': ""Police name the victim's husband, cousin as suspects after initial investigations."", 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2017/03/58b915cb85d4f.jpg?r=1286968518'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2017-03-03 12:44:09', 'modified_time': '2017-06-21 13:28:45', 'tag': 'Violence against women', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/1272/hanif-samoon'}, 'keywords': 'Violence against women', 'news_keywords': 'Violence against women', 'author': 'Hanif Samoon'})",[],dawn

Taxila circle Sub-Divisional Police Officer Deputy Superintendent of Police Tahir Kazmi told the press on Monday that the suspect, a resident of Muneerabad, married 18-year-old Mobeen Bibi six days ago.

He said the couple developed differences, and during an argument on Sunday, the suspect shot Mobeen with a 30-bore pistol, killing her instantly. The suspect escaped, but was traced by a police team led by Station House Officer Mohammad Rafeeq and arrested.

The Wah Saddar police also arrested another man for allegedly killing his coworker.

Mr Kazmi said that 25-year-old Hussain Ahmed was shot in the chest at his place of work on June 28. Using CCTV footage and eyewitness statements, the police arrested a coworker of the victim who confessed to killing him over an old dispute between them during interrogation.

Separately, a 16-year-old was abducted in the limits of the same police station on Monday. The victim’s brother told police that she left the house for work and was abducted by six people, one of whom was a woman.

The police have registered an abduction case against the nominated suspects.

https://www.dawn.com/news/752244/the-wages-of-pride,9/26/12 20:00,The wages of pride,"THERE are moments when being Pakistani, one feels the nation has made remarkable headway — from technology to travel to nuclear energy. And then there is the vital question of humanity and where we rank on that barometer.

It is the 21st century and Pakistan still reports numerous cases of honour killing annually despite the phenomenon of underreporting. Honour-killing is defined as “gender-based violence … the homicide of a member of a family or social group by other members, due to the belief the victim has brought dishonour upon the family or community”.

Karo-kari falls under the same ambit, literally translating into ‘black male’ (karo) and ‘black female’ (kari). After labelling a ‘dishonourable’ woman ‘kari’, the family aims to restore its honour by killing both the ‘karo’ and ‘kari.’

The concept of women being viewed as property has long existed and the birth of the girl child in many societies continues to be viewed as a blow to the family’s so-called pride. In some societies a man is hit with a shoe seven times if a daughter is born. Interestingly, in many instances the socially constructed concept of ‘honour’ is deployed euphemistically in order to veil the real motive at hand, such as a property feud, inheritance struggle or, in the case of a man, remarriage.

The fire of gender-based violence in Pakistan was further fuelled by the introduction of Zia’s much-debated Hudood Ordinance, which Musharraf later replaced with the Women’s Protection Bill of 2006.

However, the continued lack of attention by public-sector and law-enforcement agencies alike towards demanding accountability of those who commit honour killings has played a big role in perpetuating such incidents, which are at odds with the modern era we inhabit. Human rights and women’s protection has never been a sustained priority for the government. I guess we parted ways with Napoleon’s call to the importance of mothers and women eons ago.

However, not all is lost — select filmmakers and writers have been courageous enough to begin touching upon topics of social importance in Pakistan. At least we are learning to begin the dialogue and to me, that is undoubtedly a silver lining.

Then there are stories of courageous individuals like Khalida Brohi who hails from Balochistan. Despite the oppressive social norms she had to contend with, Khalida was determined to make a difference to people’s lives. In 2004 she joined hands with a group of young people who laid the foundation for Participatory Development Initiatives (PDI) in Khuzdar, Balochistan. The key aim of PDI was to promote participatory and sustainable development, whilst protecting the ecosystem and striking a gender balance — in other words, an equal opportunities endeavour.

Khalida had the foresight to pre-empt the fact that the success of her efforts hinged severely on maximum community participation as well as on the philosophy that financial empowerment would become an enabler for social inclusion.

As a result her initiatives involved interactive entrepreneurial programmes, including cricket tournaments, peer to peer education programmes and public theatre events which had a two-fold aim — creating awareness around issues of significance and promoting critical dialogue amongst decision makers, including tribal leaders. Transformation to Khalida meant direct involvement at the village level rather than just overarching conversation — this resulted in the creation of sustainable Sughar resource centres in a number of tribal areas of Balochistan.

In 2008 Khalida and her programme partners successfully launched a campaign with the aim of reducing the number of honour killing cases and tackling the tribal customs associated with the existence of the jirga system. Khalida’s success culminated in a 400-person march to challenge honour killing and gender-based violence in Pakistan.

On the flip side, what is interesting is that unlike most other efforts, PDI also remains neutral enough to include efforts to preserve and protect the more productive and value-additional nuances of Balochi tribal traditions via skill development and capacity-building programmes, as opposed to a cookie cutter, one-size-fits-all strategy. Such courageous endeavours must be recognised and applauded: Khalida’s agenda and terrain are very challenging, yet her success rate is truly inspirational.

Finally, the prevalence of such traditions in Pakistan can’t help but point towards Warren Buffet’s concept of the inner versus outer scorecard. The inner scorecard is an individual’s own criteria by which one judges him or herself. In contrast, the outer scorecard is the “picture of self-worth predicated upon the judgments of others”. The parallel thus drawn is that between “intrinsic value” vis-à-vis “market-value”. The latter is obviously a subtle form of ego.

As Buffet says, “If the world couldn’t see your results, would you rather be thought of as the world’s greatest investor but in reality have the world’s worst record? Or be thought of as the world’s worst investor when you were actually the best?”

The existence of gender-based violence including karo-kari is a reiteration of the reality that the quest for external reassurance continues in humans unabated. Women must abide by socially restrictive practices to ensure that no damage is done to the family’s honour and thus safeguard the reputation of men. Social approval and outer scorecard at play yet again. Who thinks what and of whom? Alas, they are the superior sex indeed!

Lums, considered one of the top Pakistani varsities, issued an official statement a day after a group of students along with members of on-campus FemSoc (Feminist Society at Lums) approached the dean of the Office of Student Affairs to voice their concerns ""regarding a social media page where some students belonging to Lums were sharing offensive, sexist memes"".

""The students and the Dean had a detailed conversation and agreed that this is an unfortunate episode,"" the statement said, stressing that the university encourages an environment where students can freely exchange ideas and debate important issues.

""However, it [the exposé] can actually help open doors to further the conversation on mutual respect and sensitise the community at large on gender issues,"" it added.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1452696,12/21/18 7:03,Art exhibition highlights various aspects of gender-based violence,"— White Star

ISLAMABAD: The works of 10 young artists highlighting various aspects of gender-based violence were exhibited on Thursday in a show titled Silence Allows Violence – Breaking Silence through Art.

The exhibition was held at the Pakistan National Council of Arts as part of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, and inaugurated by Shirakat – Partnership for Development and MenEngage Alliance Pakistan.

Shirakat Executive Director Bilquis Tahira introduced the organisation and its role as the secretariat of the MenEngage Alliance. She said: “Shirakat uses creative approaches to change the attitudes and behaviours that lead to gender-based violence and inequities. We have found that arts, culture and sports are very strong mediums to change the mindsets that reduce the risk of gender violence.”

The exhibiting artists used various mediums to depict their perception of women’s strength, role and potential while others highlighted the restrictions and repressive practices that have found space in society.

Sadia Atif said that all the artists were “breaking the silence through our art to stop violence and to stop the silence around violence”.

She added: ‘My theme is to highlight and stop sex selective abortion where the girl child is terminated as boys are preferred. If there is no girl, there is no woman, no society, and eventually no boy.”

Another exhibiting artist, Numaira Javed, said she tried to show the importance of women in society.

“I believe there is a whole world inside a woman and she should carry on as she wants without being affected by society. Her thoughts are like butterflies that add beauty on earth and this beauty can only be effective if her thoughts are free and her creativity is not restricted,” she went on.

“I think it is time we should stop talking about violence against a specific gender, I think we should talk about violence against humanity. Art is a celebration of life, and if we are creating something we should be sensitive enough to understand that the most important things that we need are love, peace, tolerance and diversity,” artist Raza Shah said.

Jean-Francois Cautain, ambassador of the European Union, said at the exhibition: “For me, gender based violence, especially violence against women, is the darkest side of patriarchy. This is not specific to Pakistan but Pakistan also has a way to go before achieving gender equality and we are working on that with our partners.”

“In any country artists are visionaries. They are the people who are looking beyond the limits of society; they are trying to break the barriers and boundaries. Congratulations to the artists on what they have created, I am very impressed by what I have seen. I hope that people come to see the exhibition and men and women are inspired and engaged by it,” he said.

Canadian High Commissioner Wendy Gilmour said: “Violence against women and girls is a problem that affects all of our societies, not just Pakistan, not just South Asia. Activities like the 16 Days of Activism and this art exhibition remind us there is so much that we have to do on these subjects.

“One in three women and girls experience violence over the course of their lifetimes so we have to work with our boys and men while they are young so they realize the role they have to play to stop gender-based violence. It is only through women’s participation in public life, in political life, in industry, in all spheres, in the army, in the police, that we will ensure that there is space for women and safety for women in our societies.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1395488/sexual-gender-based-violence-victims-must-be-helped,3/16/18 7:13,"‘Sexual, gender-based violence victims must be helped’","KARACHI: A senior forensic official in the Sindh government on Thursday permitted a women’s rights organisation to establish one-window operation service vis-à-vis sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) at his office and three major government-run hospitals in the city.

“One-window operation service (OWOS) needs to be established at the police surgeon office, Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital, the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for timely collection of evidence in SGBV cases,” said Dr Aijaz Ahmed Khokhar, police surgeon, while speaking at a workshop aimed to create awareness on juvenile and women protection laws and behaviour change.

The event was organised by War Against Rape (WAR) at a hotel to mark and celebrate International Women’s Day. He said WAR would be given room at the medico-legal facilities at those places. However, it still required support from the police to deploy their officers at those places.

To avoid deliberate delays in the registration of FIRs, one male and one female official would be available at the OWOS round-the-clock for timely collection of forensic evidence and registration of complaints.

“This will certainly improve the conviction rate in SGBV cases,” said Dr Khokhar.

Syeda Shehla Raza, deputy speaker of the Sindh Assembly, who is also patron of the women parliamentarian caucus, said family members, society and civil society organisations should stand alongside survivors and victims of SGBV.

“Women themselves must speak out for their rights. Men and women should be given equal rights and resources. We have to change the way of our society to eliminate patriarchal customary practices,” said Ms Raza.

She added Sindh had progressive laws for protection of women and children. She also asked the NGOs to approach lawmakers and heads of the political parties to train their representatives on the issues of protection of women and children.

Nuzhat Shireen, chairperson of the Sindh Commission on Status of Women, said a lot of work needed to be done regarding these issues.

“In Sindh we don’t have safe houses for women and girls to provide them shelter. Due to certain mindset and patriarchy in our society, they (women) have no right to live at will.”

She spoke about a case study pertaining to honour killing which is rampant in the province, saying that the lives of such women needed to be saved.

Rights activist Mahnaz Rahman said the NGOs must participate in legal proceedings pertaining to the cases of rape and other forms of sexual violence in support and solidarity with the families of SGBV victims.

Dr Astrid Bosch, head of Programme GiZ, spoke over the role of the organisation in strengthening the criminal justice system enabling it to carry out its statutory tasks within the framework of respective responsibilities of various segments, and in mutual cooperation with each other in Sindh and Punjab.

She said they were providing support to the state for creation of mechanisms to ensure appropriate response by the criminal justice system towards vulnerable groups, especially children and women.

Beena Hasan, coordinator WAR, said considering the severity of the increasing trend of child sexual abuse and increasing crimes of sexual and gender-based violence on women, it was the need of the hour to build capacity of relevant stakeholders of the criminal justice system, which included police, prosecution officers, and judges.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1383652,1/18/18 7:23,Child protection,"The writer is an advocate of the high court, practising in Lahore.

THE abduction, rape and murder of little Zainab has not only robbed one family of a child but has also ravaged this country. She was not the first child we failed to protect.

Child abuse, particularly sexual violence, is one of the most pressing social issues facing our nation. Such crimes are tragic reminders of the failure of the state, and call for a complete overhaul of our intent towards child protection.

The majority of the child abuse cases in Pakistan are registered under the Zina Ordinance, 1979, which prohibits all forms of illegal sexual intercourse including rape. The Punjab Suppression of Prostitution Ordinance, 1961, the Sindh Children Act, 1955, and the Punjab Children Ordinance, 1983, all cover some forms of child abuse.

Read: Is it fair to blame Kasur police alone for failure to track down culprits behind incidents of rape, murder?

In 1990, Pakistan ratified the UN Conven­tion on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), committing itself to implement the convention’s provisions through harmonised policies, legislation and plans of action, and to report progress to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child every five years.

After revelations of a child pornography ring in Kasur in 2015, 20 people were arrested in connection with the criminal scandal. At the time, only rape and sodomy were punishable under the law. As a result, several new provisions were added to our legislature to strengthen our child protection framework.

Let little Zainab be the last child we fail as a state.

The first amendment to the Pakistan Penal Code in relation to child abuse in 2016 criminalised sexual assault against minors, child pornography and trafficking. Sexual assault is now punishable by up to seven years in prison (previously, only rape was criminalised), and child pornography (previously not included in the law) is punishable by seven years in prison and a fine of Rs700,000.

Prosecution for rape has also benefited from recent amendments. Sections 164(A) and 164(B), inserted into the Code of Criminal Procedure in 2016, enable authorities to obtain and use DNA evidence. Section 161(A) also guarantees a rape victim the right to legal representation.

Despite a complex framework, the legislative tools we have at our disposal have not been utilised effectively, and have thus far failed to deter perpetrators of violence against children. While further specialised legislation is needed, as the situation stands, our biggest failure in protecting our children is not lack of legislation but lack of its enforcement.

The depravity that leads to such crimes occurring, especially considering the circumstances of Zainab’s case, calls for further action. The preamble to the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, introduces the act “to provide for the prevention of terrorism, sectarian violence and for speedy trial of heinous offences”. Based on these goals, it is high time that rape and sexual violence against children were added to Section 6 of the ATA so that it may be prosecuted with the same vigilance given to perpetrators of acts of terror.

The DNA profile of all citizens should be included in the Nadra database.

It is also necessary to properly train judicial officials and law-enforcement agencies. According to Human Rights Watch, “Even a well-drafted law is unlikely to achieve its objectives in the absence of a trained and accountable police force, adequately staffed probation departments, judges that are familiar with the applicable domestic law and international standards, and facilities that are designed for the guidance and care of juvenile offenders.”

The juvenile justice system also requires attention.

The age defining a child should be brought up in accordance to what is prescribed internationally. Secondly, there should be equal treatment for children regardless of gender — as for zina crimes, female victims should no longer be punished for an abuse inflicted upon them. Thirdly, there should be stricter punishment against perpetrators of sexual violence against children. And, as per Article 39 of the UNCRC, the government should take all necessary measures to promote the psychological and physical recovery of child victims. Currently, rehabilitative measures are underdeveloped, if not non-existent. There is an urgent need to establish such facilities throughout the country.

There must be an overhaul of the system at every level so that the authorities are not only successful in recovering children, but also in catching and punishing culprits. The crimes against Zainab reflect the absolute failure of the police, expose the lack of foresight in our legislature, and have resulted in the public losing all faith in this government.

If we wait much longer to effect concrete change, we will also lose faith in ourselves. The fate of young Zainab, loving daughter, thoughtful sister, cherished granddaughter, passionate student — human being — should be etched in our collective conscience. Let her be the last child we fail as a state.

The case against these convicts was registered at Ganda Singhwala police station in Kasur District.

Last year, at least 280 children were filmed being sexually abused by a gang of 25 men who used the hundreds of videos they produced to blackmail the youngsters' parents.

Most of the victims who are from Husain Khanwala village near Kasur are less than 14-years-old.

Their families had also been blackmailed by the gang since 2009.

The abusers allegedly tried to extort money from parents of victims, selling clips of the videos locally for 40 rupees each if they did not pay up.

A property dispute allegedly brought the issue to the surface.

Activists working to fight child sex abuse in Pakistan said the problem was widespread but difficult to quantify because victims were often unwilling to speak out.

According to a Dawn newspaper report, in recent years, more and more families in Pakistan have dared to speak out against sexual abuse of their children.

But the fight against predators remains in its infancy.

Powerful taboos, gaps in legislation and a lack of awareness continue to fuel a phenomenon that remains hidden, yet deeply embedded within society.","['Dawn.Com', 'Imran Gabol', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1328243,4/21/17 7:01,Abortion,"THIS refers to media reports (April 8) wherein a woman ingested rat poison because she felt she could not get justice, leading to the death of her unborn child, possibly conceived during her rape.

It is time we clarified things about abortion in Pakistan. I personally believe a woman should have the legal right to an abortion if (a) she is raped and the fetus is conceived owing to rape; (b) in cases of incest; (c) where the mother’s life is in danger if the pregnancy is carried to term; and (d) if the fetus appears deformed.

No one should have to ingest rat poison to kill a fetus, whose birth and whose life will be a daily reminder of a rape. The US has abortion on demand, with restrictions for minors who need to see a judge acting as legal guardian if the parents cannot be approached by the child.

While I morally oppose abortion in my own family, I am not opposed to abortion by other people in what is obviously a free society, by people who are all accountable before God for their own choices in life.

I will not consider forcing my morality upon anyone else living in a free society. My own personal view is that abortion is murder. The best argument for the other side is made in the Hollywood movie, Dirty Dancing, starring Patrick Swayze, for keeping abortion legal.

If women are forced to have illegal abortions, their own lives, future fertility and health could be seriously at risk through unsafe practices relating to illegal abortions. Much better is to have it available in hospitals by qualified doctors.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1021167/british-asian-paedophile-gang-jailed-for-life,6/27/13 22:57,British Asian paedophile gang jailed for life,"LONDON: Five members of a British Asian paedophile gang were jailed for life on Thursday for grooming vulnerable underage girls for sex.

The gang's five-month trial heard that they exploited at least six troubled girls as young as 11 in the English city of Oxford, plying them with drugs before forcing them to perform sex acts.

Brothers Akhtar and Anjum Dogar were handed life terms by a judge at London's Old Bailey court along with Kamar Jamil and brothers Mohammed and Bassam Karrar.

Two more defendants, Assad Hussain and Zeeshan Ahmed, were jailed for seven years each.

Four of the victims, who were abused between 2004 and last year, had lived in state-run children's homes.

The trial heard that the girls, aged between 11 and 15 at the time of the abuse, were repeatedly and violently raped, beaten and in one case forced to have an abortion at the age of 12.

They were sometimes driven across the country to have sex with other men. Several were gang-raped.

The men -- who were all of Pakistani origin except the North African Karrar brothers -- were found guilty last month of a catalogue of crimes including rape, trafficking and organising prostitution.

Judge Peter Rook told the Dogar brothers they had committed “extremely grave crimes” as he jailed them for a minimum of 17 years each.

“You targeted the young girls because they were vulnerable, underage and out of control,” he said.

“You would build up their trust and provide them with drink, drugs and the attention which they craved.”

“From a misguided loyalty to you, they were reluctant to tell the authorities what was happening to them.” The court heard of the lasting psychological scars inflicted on the girls, one of whom had considered suicide.

One girl told a friend that she submitted to the abuse because she just wanted to be loved.

The family of one victim said in a statement on Thursday that the men “took her from us and we will never get those lost years back.”

Police and social services were forced to apologise after missing several chances to catch the gang.

Judge Peter Rook told the Dogar brothers they had committed “extremely grave crimes” as he jailed them for a minimum of 17 years each.
“You targeted the young girls because they were vulnerable, underage and out of control,” he said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1583767,10/7/20 20:03,Mirpur police arrest son of former AJK chief justice for allegedly harassing female doctor,"Police in Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s (AJK) Mirpur city arrested the son of a former chief justice of the AJK Supreme Court, Chaudhry Ibrahim Zia, for allegedly harassing a woman for the past two years in Muzaffarabad, it emerged on Wednesday.

The arrest of the suspect, Arsalan Zia, who is a BS-17 ad-hoc employee in the Information Technology section of the AJK high court, was made at around midnight on an application filed by the victim’s father — an advocate who hails from the Kotli district — at around 11:15pm on Tuesday.

According to the complaint, a copy of which is available with Dawn, the victim, who studied medicine in Muzaffarabad from 2014 to 2019, lived in a hostel that was owned by the suspect’s father and built largely on the course of a water channel near the prime minister’s house.

The complainant alleged that in December 2018, his daughter noticed that the suspect would covertly take pictures of female students from the roof of the hostel, which he would visit on the pretext of checking the building's maintenance.

“After some time, my daughter started receiving calls and messages from different numbers by the suspect who would ask her to maintain relations with him,” he alleged, adding that on her refusal, the suspect started threatening her while boasting about the position of his father — then the serving chief justice.

The suspect would also chase her to and from the two teaching hospitals in Muzaffarabad in official vehicles with impunity and force her to take a ride with him, the complainant said.

According to him, since the suspect worked in the IT section, he had also hacked his daughter's social media accounts and copied her pictures and personal information to blackmail her.

“At least twice, he tried to bundle my daughter in an official vehicle — once in Muzaffarabad and the next time in Rawalpindi — but failed after she raised a hue and cry,” he said.

The complainant further said that his daughter completed her medical education in April 2020 and started a house job in Mirpur, but the suspect continued to harass her.

The suspect had been in Mirpur for the past few days but on Monday, he arrived at the hospital and threatened the woman in the presence of a senior doctor with death if she did not accompany him to contract marriage, the victim's father said.

He said that he had rushed from Kotli to Mirpur when a senior doctor informed him about the incident, in order to lodge a complaint with the police.

“My daughter is in a state of shock and depression. I want strict legal action not only against this guy who is her known tormentor but also his hidden colleagues,” he concluded.

After registering a first information report under sections 489H, 489 ZXD, 501(2) of Penal Code and section 11 of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Act, Mirpur Police took the suspect into custody.

Police sources said they believed that it was not an isolated incident involving one particular individual but a group of people harassing and intimidating women.

Police will scrutinise mobile numbers in the use of the suspect as well as his social media accounts to gather more information about such elements, the sources said.

Meanwhile, a senior Mirpur-based journalist claimed that the former chief justice had contacted some senior police officials, complaining that harsh sections had been incorporated in the FIR against his son.

Despite repeated attempts to contact DIG Mirpur Sardar Ilyas Khan and SSP Raja Irfan Salim, they could not be reached for comment.","['Tariq Naqash', 'Ibrahim S', 'One Nation', 'Marquis De Sade', 'Tahir A', 'Salam Shahid', 'Zeeshan Ahmed', 'Mumtaz Ahmed Shah', 'Noor Ahmad', 'Islamabad Diaries']","Police in Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s (AJK) Mirpur city arrested the son of a former chief justice of the AJK Supreme Court, Chaudhry Ibrahim Zia, for allegedly harassing a woman for the past two years in Muzaffarabad, it emerged on Wednesday.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1511475,10/18/19 7:10,‘Effective multimedia campaign can help prevent gender-based violence’,"PESHAWAR: Speakers at the Media Conference here on Thursday called for the resolution of the issues of media persons to enable them to effectively play their role as human rights defenders.

The event titled ‘media, gender and right to service’ highlighted the significance of different mediums of media and stressed the need for their use for the eradication of sexual and gender-based violence and change in the people’s attitudes towards social issues through better awareness.

It was organised by Blue Veins in collaboration with the Peshawar Press Club and Right to Public Service Commission.

Provincial anti-harassment ombudsperson Rukhshanda Naz said gender-based violence was one of the most prevalent human rights abuses.

Experts call for resolution of journalists’ issues

She said journalists could play a fundamental role in highlighting the voice of the people, whose rights were violated.

Ms Naz said media could help highlight interventions and change attitudes, practices and behaviours, which drove violence against women.

Chief Commissioner of the Right to Public Services Commission Mohammad Mushtaq Jadoon said the media was playing the role of an ‘agenda setter’, which could easily disseminate information and influence public opinion.

He said the use of modern media tactics could promote human rights.

Right to Information Commissioner Riaz Daudzai said the media played a vital role in raising awareness of gender-based violence as it set the agenda, which gave it the power to dictate what people saw and hear and shaped their attitudes towards different aspects of life.

Programme coordinator of Blue Veins Qamar Naseem said media was one of the pillars of power to influence public attitudes and social structure.

He said the government and non-government service providers were struggling to improve response services to gender-based violence, so they needed to become skilled at engaging journalists in their coordinated efforts as an integral part of advocacy.

Journalists Aqeel Yousafzai and Waseem Ahmad called for the adoption of multimedia engagement approach.

They said an intensive multimedia campaign would help reduce and prevent gender-based violence and ensure that the survivors have safe and improved access to services.

Chairman of the Department of Journalism and Mass Communication, University of Peshawar, Dr Faizullah Jan said to improve the role of media towards better understanding of gender roles, social attitudes and root causes of gender-based violence, there was a need for ensuring adequate capacity development and sensitisation for effective media reporting on gender-based violence issues.

General secretary of Khyber Union of Journalists Mohammad Naeem said such events could suggested actions to policymakers and the media for advocating a stronger legal and regulatory environment to support voluntary, equitable and rights-based programmes.

The conference also contributed into the signing of a statement by media representatives promising commitment to addressing sexual and gender-based violence in collaboration with provincial and national stakeholders.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1457784/steps-urged-to-control-gender-based-violence,1/16/19 7:12,Steps urged to control gender-based violence,"PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Commission on the Status of Women has condemned the murder of a ninth grader girl and stressed the need for a comprehensive approach to combat gender-based violence.

In a statement here on Tuesday, KPCSW expressed grave concerns over rise in murders of girls and women in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other provinces.

It said that the rising trend of rape and killing of minors required urgent action on part of relevant departments.

The KPCSW said that 51 women had been murdered, 21 committed suicide while nine had been assaulted between July and December 2018.

“In the first two weeks of January 2019, there have been eight cases of murder and rape of minors,” it added.

The statement said that sexual violence was seldom reported as the victims were either silenced in the name of honour or killed by their own families.

“These are grave violations of human rights and can only be combated by addressing the root causes of such crimes -- gender inequality and discrimination. The effective and timely implementation of laws is a prerequisite of justice,” it added.

KPCSW recognises the efforts of KP police in tracking the culprits on the priority basis, the efforts of media to highlight such cases and the struggle of civil society organisations to create awareness among people and work with government to eradicate such violence.

“However, the entire system starting with reporting, prosecution, sentencing, shelters and post shelter integration requires strengthening,” said the statement.

It said that a comprehensive approach involving relevant government departments along with the government commissions for children, information and right to services as well as civil society was must to work on a practical roadmap for arresting and reversing those trends.

In a statement here on Tuesday, KPCSW expressed grave concerns over rise in murders of girls and women in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other provinces.
It said that the rising trend of rape and killing of minors required urgent action on part of relevant departments.
The KPCSW said that 51 women had been murdered, 21 committed suicide while nine had been assaulted between July and December 2018.
“In the first two weeks of January 2019, there have been eight cases of murder and rape of minors,” it added.","['relevant', 'murder', 'society', 'urged', 'violence', 'steps', 'kpcsw', 'genderbased', 'control', 'statement', 'rape', 'work', 'minors', 'women', 'pakhtunkhwa']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3175651ed1.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd317cae34dd.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2dd0a4c9db.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd329902b790.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg', 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}",TRUE,http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Commission on the Status of Women has condemned the murder of a ninth grader girl and...', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1457784', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Steps urged to control gender-based violence', 'description': 'PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Commission on the Status of Women has condemned the murder of a ninth grader girl and...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1457784', 'title': 'Steps urged to control gender-based violence', 'description': 'PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Commission on the Status of Women has condemned the murder of a ninth grader girl and...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2019-01-16 07:12:44', 'modified_time': '2019-01-16 07:12:44', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/183/bureau-report'}, 'author': 'Bureau Report'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1371275,11/18/17 6:58,US troops told to ignore child abuse in Afghanistan,"WASHINGTON: The US Department of Defence has advised American soldiers to ignore child sex abuse in Afghanistan as a culturally acceptable phenomenon, says a Pentagon report.

The department’s “cultural-awareness training for US personnel deploying to Afghanistan … identified child sexual abuse as a culturally-accepted practice in Afghanistan,” says a report the Pentagon’s Inspector General’s office released on Thursday afternoon.

The Inspector General, however, said that his review did not lead him to a specific command or policy guideline that “expressly discouraged personnel from reporting incidents of child sexual abuse”.

But in some cases, US military personnel deployed in Afghanistan told that “nothing could be done about child sexual abuse because of Afghanistan’s status as a sovereign nation”. They were also informed that it was not a priority for the US command to discourage such practices and it was best to “ignore the situation and to let the local police handle it”.

Controversy erupted last year after a New York Times report alleged that the Pentagon had prevented US troops from reporting when Afghan police and militia officials sexually assaulted children. The report claimed that some US troops were punished when they reported the abuse.

The Pentagon rejected the report as incorrect but US lawmakers instructed the inspector general to investigate the matter and send a report to Congress.

The IG’s report noted that the US Army and Air Force training do not discuss paedophilia in Afghanistan, but Navy and Marines do. The Navy training manual “advises readers to control and overcome any frustration caused by cultural differences that they may experience during their deployments,” while the Marines were told “to be mentally prepared to encounter this attitude, and to ‘move on’.”

Also, several current or former service members told investigators they were told to ignore the behaviour.

They were told that if they witnessed child sexual abuse, “they should let the local officials or police know and not interfere with the locals,” the report said. “The interviewee said that the reason given as to why not to interfere was due to maintaining cooperation with the Afghans”.

Another interviewee told investigators that the chain of command didn’t care until The New York Times reported on the issue.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1239156,2/13/16 6:53,Survivors of gender-based violence tell their stories,"ISLAMABAD: Naila Farhat had acid thrown at her by a suitor her family had refused her hand to. Now, 13 years after the attack in which her face was damaged, Naila is working as an assistant nurse at the Acid Survivors Foundation.

At a ceremony held in connection with National Women’s Day on Friday, Naila said she had taken the attacker to court and made sure he was punished.

The event was hosted by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Aurat Foundation. Many women who had survived violence of one kind or another participated and shared their experiences in a show of solidarity with other women who might be going through the same situation.

A flood survivor from Kashmore, Razia, said she had started her handicraft business to help support her family.

She added that USAID’s Gender Equity Programme (GEP) and the Aurat Foundation had helped her figure out how to start the handicraft business which now employs many other women from her village

“I am now able to not only support my own family, but also others in my village. The whole experience has made me more confident and courageous,” she said.

The ongoing GEP was initiated by USAID and the Aurat Foundation. The five-year project worth $40 million aims to improve women’s access to justice, expand economic opportunities for women, work for their social and political empowerment, support survivors of gender-based violence and help the civil society and the government in preventing, responding to and eliminating gender-based violence.

Another beneficiary of GEP, Azra Bibi, said that through the programme, she had learnt about labour laws and workers’ rights.

“I learnt about how workers could organise themselves to demand their rights,” she added.

American Ambassador David Hale, who was the chief guest at the event, praised the bravery and determination of Pakistani women.

“Investing in women and girls promotes gender equality and has a ripple effect in that it improves all aspects of society. No country can move ahead if it leaves half its population behind,” he said.

He acknowledged the contributions of five ‘women of strength’ towards gender equality in the country. Each of the five women had participated in GEP, which is the largest USAID programme in Pakistan which specifically works for women empowerment.

GEP Head Simi Kamal said the country-wide project had provided hundreds of sub-grants to universities, governments departments and other organisations which worked for women empowerment.

She said women from all walks of life, including those working from home, lawyers, domestic workers and students have benefited from the project.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1403802/police-exhume-remains-of-pakistani-origin-italian-woman-over-honour-killing-reports,4/25/18 18:06,Police exhume remains of Pakistani-origin Italian woman over 'honour' killing reports,"Police on Wednesday exhumed the body of an Italian national of Pakistani origin over claims she had been murdered by relatives in a so-called 'honour' killing, in a case that has made headlines across Italy.

Police in Gujrat launched an investigation earlier this week into the death of 26-year-old Sana Cheema after allegations she had been murdered went viral online.

“After the news of her death spread on social media, police found the family and started an investigation,” said police officer Waqar Gujjar.

A member of the media films the house of Sana Cheema in the neighbourhood of Mangowal, near Gujrat. — AP

Cheema's father, brother and uncle are currently being held in custody for questioning but have not been charged, added Gujrat police officer Mudassar Sajjad.

“Now it depends on the post-mortem report. If it determines the cause of death is due to murder, only then will police charge the suspects,” said Sajjad.

According to family members, Cheema died earlier this month after succumbing to an unspecified illness, said police officer Syed Mobarak.

Police said Cheema's father Ghulam Mustafa brought her back to Pakistan to get married. This ultimately led to a confrontation with a nearby family who spurned the offer of a match, according to the woman's family.

Because of the rejection Cheema refused to eat, fell ill and died, relatives told police.

Reports in Italian newspapers alleged Cheema was killed because she wanted to marry a man in Italy against her family's wishes. The reports further alleged that Cheema’s parents had been forcing her to marry someone in the family in the days leading up to her death.

A spokesperson for the Gujrat police had earlier told Dawn that Kunjah police visited Mangowal town, where Cheema had been staying with her family, and collected some information about her death which strengthened their suspicions about the version offered by the woman’s family.

Scores of women in Pakistan are still being murdered by relatives for bringing shame on their family, more than a year since new laws came into force aimed at stemming the flow of 'honour killings'.

The legislation mandates life imprisonment for honour killings, but whether a murder can be defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge's discretion.

That means the culprits can simply claim another motive and still be pardoned, according to Dr Farzana Bari, a widely respected activist and head of the Gender Studies Department at Islamabad's Quaid-i-Azam University.","['On Flip Side', 'Imtiaz Ali Khan', 'M.

The legislation mandates life imprisonment for honour killings, but whether a murder can be defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge's discretion.","['remains', 'exhume', 'gujrat', 'earlier', 'officer', 'murdered', 'woman', 'reports', 'pakistaniorigin', 'cheema', 'death', 'womans', 'italian', 'honour', 'killing', 'family', 'relatives']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd29e77ecee6.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2017/09/59b92ee62771c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/09/59b92ee62771c.jpg?r=867978874', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2018/04/5ae018af85e36.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2018/04/5ae079e57924b.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e4d6d7c0e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2018/04/5ae079ac64be3.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2018/04/5ae079ac16853.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2018/04/5ae079e57a279.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd22283a73d3.png', 'http://i.dawn.com/2011/11/290x230-mohammad-shafia.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f94d8916a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2018/04/5ae018af85e36.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24c3aad888.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24e90196c5.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2018/04/5ae079e57924b.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': ""The woman's family members will be charged if the post-mortem report shows the cause of death is due to murder: police."", 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1403802', 'type': 'article', 'title': ""Police exhume remains of Pakistani-origin Italian woman over 'honour' killing reports"", 'description': ""The woman's family members will be charged if the post-mortem report shows the cause of death is due to murder: police."", 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2018/04/5ae079e57a279.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1403802', 'title': ""Police exhume remains of Pakistani-origin Italian woman over 'honour' killing reports"", 'description': ""The woman's family members will be charged if the post-mortem report shows the cause of death is due to murder: police."", 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2018/04/5ae079e57a279.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2018-04-25 18:06:25', 'modified_time': '2018-04-25 18:57:34', 'tag': 'Violence against women', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/119/afp'}, 'keywords': 'Violence against women', 'news_keywords': 'Violence against women', 'author': 'AFP'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1230040/,1/1/16 11:49,China's new two-child policy law takes effect,"BEIJING: Married couples in China will from Friday be allowed to have two children, after concerns over an ageing population and shrinking workforce ushered in an end to the country's controversial one-child policy.

The change, which was announced in October by the ruling Communist Party, takes effect from January 1, 2016, Beijing's official Xinhua news agency reported over the weekend.

The “one child policy”, instituted in the late 1970s, restricted most couples to only a single offspring through a system of fines for violators and even forced abortions.

For years, authorities argued that it was a key contributor to China's economic boom and had prevented 400 million births.

Rural families were allowed two children if the first was a girl, while ethnic minorities were allowed an extra offspring, leading some to dub it a “one-and-a-half child” policy.

But it also led to heart-rending tales of loss for would-be parents, and prompted sex-selective abortions or infanticide targeting girls because of a centuries-old social preference for boys.

China's population -- the world's largest at 1.37 billion -- is now ageing rapidly and has severe gender imbalances, all while the country's workforce is shrinking.

Under the new law, married couples are now allowed to have a second child, but the legislation maintains limits on additional births.

Around three million extra babies will be born each year over the next five years as a result, officials from the National Health and Family Planning Commission predicted at a briefing in November.

This would add a total of about 30 million people to the labour force by 2050, officials said.

Still, experts say the shift is likely too little, too late to address China's looming population crisis.

Others warn that many Chinese couples do not want more children, particularly given the expense, and the effects of the change remain unclear.","['Faisal Bajwa', 'Sajjad Khan', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1592396/16-days-of-activism-drive-launched-against-gender-based-violence,11/26/20 7:18,16 days of activism drive launched against gender-based violence,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Human Rights on Wednesday launched a 16 Days of Activism Campaign on women’s fundamental rights through a series of short informational videos.

The launching ceremony, which was held at a local hotel, was attended among others by Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari and Federal Secretary for Human Rights, Rabiya Javeri Agha.

The videos will cover important topics including sexual harassment, rape, the marriage contract, filing an FIR and women’s inheritance.

The films have been developed in collaboration with the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) and Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy (SOC) Films. The Films will be available in Urdu, Sindhi, Pushto, Punjabi and Balochi languages.

In a statement, MoHR said that the films will be broadcast widely across social media that will be conducted throughout the 16 days of activism from Nov 25 to Dec 10.

The films will also be disseminated to numerous universities and colleges, as well as amongst the civil society to increase outreach.

Several radio shows are also being conducted with leading lawyers and human rights experts to generate greater awareness around these issues and stimulate discussion and dialogue at the grassroots level.

The Ministry of Human Rights said that it is also launching the 1099 helpline app, which has been developed in collaboration with UN Women to streamline and strengthen grievance redressal mechanisms against human rights violations, particularly with regards to gender-based violence and child abuse.

According to the MoHR, the app is already available for download on the Google Playstore, and apple store will also provide it early next month.

Since its launch in November 2018, the helpline has received over 450,000 calls, 49pc of them were related to women’s rights.

Addressing on the occasion Federal Secretary for Human Rights, Rabiya Javeri Agha, said the app would provide an alternative and effective mechanism to launch and track complaints related to human rights violations.

UN Women Country Representative Shameela Rasool said: “Violence against women and girls is a grave violation of basic human rights, globally affecting one in three women in her lifetime.”

She said survivors’ journey to access justice and reintegration into the society should be the measure of our success as support groups for the distressed.

UN Women is working closely with the Ministry of Human Rights for improving the lives of women and girls of Pakistan, be it through institutional strengthening and capacity building, technical assistance for implementing, monitoring and reporting on internal commitments, data collection, legislative reform and advocacy, or service delivery for survivors, she said.

Federal Minister for Human Rights Dr Shireen Mazari reiterated the importance of strengthening and supporting grievance redressal mechanisms.

“Last month, we also launched the Zainab Alert Mechanism on the Pakistan Citizen’s Portal as well as a community engagement campaign to raise awareness about the system, encouraging and increasing reporting of child abuse in Pakistan.

“The series of films and radio shows that we are holding for 16 days of activism against gender-based violence have the potential to educate women about their fundamental rights. With the additional launch of our 1099 helpline App, we are hopeful that the alarming figures related to gender-based violence and child abuse will steadily begin to drop.”

https://www.dawn.com/news/1583926,10/8/20 13:58,"'Another Zainab': 2-year-old girl assaulted, tortured before being killed in Charsadda, say police","Inspector General of Police, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sanaullah Abbasi said on Thursday that suspects in a rape and murder case of a minor in Charsadda have been arrested but refused to share further details as it would ""affect the investigation"".

The IGP's statement came hours after Charsadda police said that the two-and-a-half-year-old girl Zainab, whose body was found in Jabba Korona area in the limits of Daudzai police station of Peshawar a day earlier, appeared to have been assaulted and tortured before being killed.

Residents and police said the minor girl had gone missing on Tuesday evening in Sheikh Kallay Qilla area while playing with other children outside her house.

On Wednesday, the Prang police got information about the body of a girl lying in Jabba Korona area. The Prang and Daudzai police recovered the body and shifted it to the Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar for postmortem.

District Police Officer (DPO) Charsadda Mohammad Shoaib Khan said that police had initially registered a first information report (FIR) in the Prang police station, Charsadda, against unknown kidnappers on the complaint of the girl's father.

Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) was added to the FIR after the body was found, he said.

Khan said that initial investigation ""suggests that the minor was assaulted before her murder"", adding that there were torture marks on the girl's body. Police were waiting for the medical report, after which they would add other sections of the PPC, he said.

According to IGP Abbasi, the DHQ hospital had ""verbally"" confirmed to the police that the victim was sexually assaulted before being killed but a formal post-mortem examination report is yet to be issued.

Zainab's father said that the family did not have enmity with anyone. He demanded that the government catch the culprit so he could ask him what his daughter had done to him that he committed such a crime.

""Today it is my Zainab, tomorrow another Zainab could suffer this,"" he lamented.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan took notice of the incident and directed the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Sanaullah Abbasi and other authorities to immediately arrest those involved.

""An example should be made out of them,"" he said and termed the incident ""heart-rending"".

The chief minister said the culprits would not be able to escape the reach of the law and the family would be provided complete justice.

IGP Abbasi also visited the victim's family and assured them that the police will soon arrest the culprits behind the heinous crime. Speaking to the media later, he said that the DPO was personally supervising the investigation of the case.

'Another Zainab'

Meanwhile, the hashtags #JusticeforZainab and #AnotherZainab were used on Twitter by netizens to express outrage over unabated cases of abuse and murder of children in the country.

Photos of the two-year-old's body were circulated on social media with many users comparing the incident to the 2018 rape and murder of 8-year-old Zainab Amin in Kasur.

Zainab Amin had gone missing on Jan 4, 2018 and five days later, a police constable deputed to trace the girl recovered her body from a heap of trash near the Shahbaz Khan Road.

Police said the girl seemed to have been killed four or five days earlier.

Being the 12th such incident to occur within a 10-kilometre radius in Kasur in one year, Zainab's rape and murder had sparked outrage and protests across the country.

Editorial: Rampant child abuse

The heinous nature of the crime had seen immediate riots break out in Kasur — in which two people were killed — while #JusticeforZainab became a rallying cry for an end to violence against children.

More than two years after the Zainab Amin case, the National Assembly passed the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Bill, 2019 that seeks to expedite investigation and punishment for perpetrators of child abuse.

The Sindh police also launched an indigenously-developed mobile phone application — the Zainab Alert Mobile App — that would help develop database of crimes against children, including registration of cases, progress on their investigations and police performance in the area.

However, violence against children has continued with as many as 1,489 children — at least eight per day — sexually abused in the first half of 2020 in Pakistan.

According to Sahil, an organisation working for child protection, the major categories in the cases included abduction (331), rape (160), sodomy (233), gang-rape (69) and gang-sodomy (104). Thirteen boys and 12 girls were murdered after sexual abuse while four boys and one girl were murdered after gang-rape.","['Sirajuddin', 'Dr. Salaria', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Imtiaz Hunzai', 'Berlin', 'Azam', 'Lars Stevens', 'Vivek Lahore', 'M.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1552827,4/28/20 5:16,Policing Covid-19,"THE coronavirus pandemic has assigned more responsibilities and roles to police. Globally, the police are making changes in operational strategies and reallocating whatever human and financial resources they have at their disposal. However, an effective response requires far more, including: additional funds, enlistment of volunteers, active communication strategies, optimum use of technology, drafting of SOPs, improved institutional coordination, and strengthening of community networks.

The enormity of the crisis has convinced governments to introduce stricter laws and regulations. To enforce lockdown, for instance, France planned deployment of 100,000 policemen and establishment of fixed checkpoints. In Italy, violators of the curfew face a three-month imprisonment or a fine of 206 euros. To monitor social distancing, Italy also approved the use of drones by police.

In Norway, a 20,000 kroner fine or 15-day imprisonment was announced for those breaking self-quarantine rules. Though Pakistan also introduced self-quarantine and isolation measures, Norway adopted all these with legal and administrative backup. Any Norwegian who travelled abroad in recent weeks has to self-isolate for 14 days, and anyone who has been in close contact with a confirmed Covid-19 patient must undergo self-isolation for two weeks. In Denmark, police send text messages to mobile subscribers as a reminder to abide by the instructions.

In the UK, police will be authorised to use force to send people back home to self-isolate during lockdown. The London Metropolitan Police requested officers who retired within the last five years to rejoin the force, either on a voluntary or paid basis. Those close to retirement have been instructed to delay their departure. In Pakistan, however, the majority of those who retire at the age of 60 face health complications, so it is difficult to replicate such initiatives here.

The police are in a better position to act as first responders.

Another concern is how to police the cyberspace. Malaysia and Singapore have clamped down on online misinformation about the coronavirus, and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commis­sion arrested some suspects for spreading misinformation about the outbreak.

The gravity of the situation in Pakistan suggests that, through criminal justice measures, self-isolation instructions need to be clearly specified. Without incorporating crisis management functions into the law, along with updated training modules and exclusive allocation, the police will be reduced to the status of a spectator or reporting agency.

Initially, the health crisis resulted in fewer crimes. However, in parts of Italy, the police warned the public to watch out for impostors knocking on doors and claiming to be Red Cross volunteers. In densely populated countries like India and Pakistan, if the coronavirus spell drags out, it may bring a surge in crimes.

Because the police has a presence in all areas, it is in a better position to immediately act as first responders. And since police stations are the basic functional apparatus of the state, citizens expect a lot more from them. The rural police stations may also be of great help in these times, but greater coordination between the health department and the police needs to be institutionalised.

Websites, email, helplines and SMS are effective tools to reach the public. All provincial police departments maintain websites, but like the centralised policing model, our websites are also over-centralised. Though a handful of police departments are running pages on social media, effective linkage requires interactive public-friendly police websites. During the ongoing crisis, for the first time, the Punjab Police started optimum use of its official website that will simultaneously improve public and media relations.

While law enforcement and public health is an emerging field, in developing countries, public health and policing are averse to collaboration. Participation of the police in such crisis could improve their image and highlight their humane face.

In Pakistan, there is hardly any effort by police organisations to document relief operations and review flaws in their working. During times of crisis, the police performs multiple functions, like rescue operations, protection of life and property, crowd management, security during relief distribution, security of rescue camps, managing traffic, and coordinating with other agencies. Since the police have regular interaction with the public, they are in the best position to infuse volunteerism among residents.

Numerical strength alone cannot yield dividends. There is a need for more comprehensive legislation, capacity building, training and equipment. The police must be financed and empowered in a manner that, before seeking help of civil armed forces, they should have the capacity to sustain the burden during the initial phase of a major crisis.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1502942,9/1/19 13:58,ATM robber whose video went viral dies in police custody in Rahim Yar Khan,"A man from Gujranwala, whose video of robbing an ATM went viral owing to his antics, died early on Sunday while in police custody.

The man identified as Salahuddin Ayubi of Gujranwala's Kamonkay district was arrested on Friday. According to the district police officer's spokesperson Zeeshan Randhawa, Ayubi was behaving like a ""mad man"" in lockup when he suddenly became unwell. He said that the man was unconscious when he was shifted to the emergency ward of Sheikh Zayed Medical College Hospital where doctors confirmed his death.

As per Randhawa, Ayubi was dead when he was brought to the hospital. According to the focal person for the hospital, the director of the emergency ward, Dr Burhan Mustafa, could not comment on the condition in which he was brought to the hospital.

The DPO's spokesperson said that the reason for Ayubi's death would be ascertained after a post-mortem report is issued. Additionally, he said that DPO Umar Farooq Salamat had constituted an inquiry team, headed by Superintendent of Police Investigation, to look into the matter.

In a video that went viral on social media a few days ago, Ayubi was seen stealing an ATM card after breaking open a machine in Faisalabad and sticking his tongue out in jest at both the camera in the corner of the booth and the one installed in the machine itself.

On Friday, he once again entered an ATM booth — this time in Rahim Yar Khan — and was in the process of breaking the machine's exterior when he was caught red-handed by other customers. The incident occurred on Shahi road at Habib Bank Limited.

A case was registered against the suspect under Sections 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 454 (lurking house trespass or house-breaking in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment) and 380 (theft in dwelling, house, etc) of the Pakistan Penal Code.","['Malik Irfanul Haq', 'Aftab Ahmad Shah', 'A A', 'Shahid Mahmood', 'Syed Zafar Kazmi U.S.A', 'Pakistan Khappay', 'Chishti Khursheed', 'Kumar Varanasi', 'Shamshad Ahmed', 'Abdul Razzaque']","A man from Gujranwala, whose video of robbing an ATM went viral owing to his antics, died early on Sunday while in police custody.

According to Mansehra police, the victim was allegedly handed a Rs1,000 bill and asked for change so it could be ""showered"" on the transgenders invited to dance at the party.

The victim, who identified herself as female, did not have any change to give the man upon which she was shot in the forehead.

Kismat Khan, another transgender who was performing at the party along with the victim, told DawnNewsTV that the accused first fired two bullets into the air and then shot her in the head.

“We both hail from Kehal area of Abbottabad and settled down in Mansehra to earn a livelihood through dancing,” she said.

She added that the two had been invited to perform at the wedding ceremony of the accused's friend where the incident occurred.

The bereaved members of the transgender community took to the streets in protest over the brutal killing and blocked the roads, demanding the arrest of the accused.

“Our community members are being killed without any reason in the entire province, but the police have failed to protect us,” said Maria Khan, the president of Shemale Association in Hazara.

“Who will provide us security? People kill us if we don’t meet their immoral demands,” she exclaimed.

Some community members were also seen assembled at the King Abdullah Teaching Hospital, where the body was taken for autopsy.

Rab Nawaz, the district police officer in Mansehra, told DawnNewsTV that the accused had a criminal background and had killed his uncle some years back.

“We have lodged a first information report (FIR) and the accused will soon be arrested,” he said.

The body was handed over to the community members after medico-legal proceedings.

According to Qamar Naseem, an activist working for the rights of transgender persons, this marks the 57th murder of a transgender in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since 2015 and the fourth this year.","['Hassan Farhan', 'M.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1550828,4/20/20 21:34,Sindh police turns focus on testing after 15 policemen diagnosed with Covid-19 in Karachi,"At least 15 police personnel have so far tested positive for the coronavirus in Karachi, prompting higher authorities to direct senior officers to get tests done of the infected policemen's family members and colleagues, officials and sources said on Monday.

The development comes as 156 of the 227 new coronavirus cases confirmed in Sindh on Monday were detected in Karachi, indicating a rise in local transmission of the virus.

Among the Covid-19 positive policemen are two inspectors and as many sub-inspectors while most of the remaining officials are either head constables or constables deputed at different places in the city.

Except one inspector who tested positive in March, all other policemen tested positive in the last 20 days, according to a list of infected police personnel obtained by Dawn.

Police sources said that one of the policemen who tested positive is a personal staff officer (PSO) to a deputy inspector general (DIG) while another is the driver of another DIG rank officer. Two other such policemen were posted at the offices of as many senior superintendents of police (SSP) in the city.

According to the sources, 22 family members of one Covid-19 positive policeman were tested for the virus, out of whom eight close relatives turned out to be positive. A colleague of an infected policeman also tested positive while the results of tests of several family members and colleagues of other positive policemen are awaited.

A senior officer said that all the infected policemen have been admitted to the isolation wards of different hospitals in the metropolis. Only one police officer was in serious condition who has since “slightly recovered” after treatment at a private hospital.

Meanwhile, Sindh Inspector General of Police Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar on Monday directed the DIGs and SSPs of all ranges, districts and units to ensure tests are carried out of the family members and colleagues of all policemen who test positive or those personnel whose test results are awaited.

An official notice issued by AIG Welfare Tauqeer Mohammed Naeem directed the DIGs and SSPs to send the reports of tests of police personnel and their families to a focal person appointed by them.

Interviews with police officials conducted by Dawn earlier this month had revealed that thousands of police personnel who were deployed to enforce the lockdown announced by the provincial government to control the spread of Covid-19 found themselves on the frontlines of the crisis without proper personal protective equipment (PPE) or training.

'Not an easy situation'

Also on Monday, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah revealed that 227 new Covid-19 cases emerged in the province during the last 24 hours after 1,600 tests were conducted. Five more people lost their lives from the disease, taking the provincial death toll to 61 in 33 days.

“Out of 227 new cases, 156 belong to Karachi and 71 to other divisions of the province but the local transmission [of the virus] has started wreaking havoc in the city,” Shah said, according to a statement issued by his office.

In a video message, the chief minister while highlighting the gravity of the situation said that 68 cases of local transmission were detected in Karachi's South district, 31 in Central, 65 in East, 23 Korangi, five West and four in Malir.

“This is not an easy situation, therefore, we will have to take some strict and proactive measures to contain it and stop its further spread,” Shah stressed.","['Imtiaz Ali', 'M.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1306976,1/7/17 14:31,Naila Rind killed herself because Pakistan's cybercrime laws failed her,"Respected Minister for Information Technology,

This might be a long letter but please bear with us as it is an important one, especially since the issue is so close to your heart — one you fought for two years.

Minister, you must have heard about Naila Rind, a student of University of Sindh in Jamshoro, who allegedly killed herself in her hostel. A top student in her Masters class, Naila, was found hanging from a ceiling fan inside room no. 36 in Marvi hostel. If you still are unaware of this unfortunate event, let us inform you what led her to take her own life.

We are sure you still remember how you burned the midnight oil for the passage of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (PECA).

Also read: Cyber crime bill passed —13 reasons Pakistanis should be worried

The law was designed to protect the daughters of Pakistan. We hope you remember, since that’s what you said in one of the meetings while rejecting our criticism on the law.

According to the police, a lecturer in a private school at Jamshoro was blackmailing Naila with her pictures and videos for three months

The credit goes to you. The law was passed last year in August, five months ago, and it contained harsh but vague provisions for cyber stalking, harassment and blackmailing against a natural person.

Minister, it seems that your ministry has neglected to inform law enforcement authorities about their role and jurisdiction under the new law. A law which was enacted in the name of 'protecting daughters of Pakistan' couldn’t save the precious life of one daughter, namely Naila.

Naila was blackmailed

Let's get to the bottom of Naila's suicide.

According to the initial investigation and First Information Report (FIR) copy, it turns out Naila was cyber blackmailed by a man named Anis Khaskheli.

Police officials say this lecturer in a private school at Jamshoro, was blackmailing Naila with her pictures and videos for three months.

After the blackmailing became too much for her, Naila took her life.

This is exactly the kind of situation your law was intended to address, so why are all the law enforcement authorities, from the police to the Federal Investigation Authority (FIA), so clueless about how to deal with the situation?

The ignorance of the authorities is on full display in the FIR by the police.

Minister, they have included section 9 and 13 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Ordinance 2009 against the accused.

Let us refresh your memory. This Ordinance was passed in the Musharraf era and is a law that you yourself were a vocal opponent of.

Minister, we think that you’ll find it quite interesting that this very Ordinance, mentioned in the FIR, has lapsed eight years ago.

Have a close look at the FIR.

A copy of the FIR

This FIR is an indictment of the failures of the state. A reminder that awareness and education about online harassment and ethical use of information and communications technology should have been the first step before enacting legislation which is unable to address the issue at hand.

The responsibility of the Ministry does not, and should not, end with passing legislation. In the rush to pass a problematic law, the Ministry neglected to think through ground realities of online harassment and the difficulties in applying the law under the current system.

Read: Dawn Editorial on the Cybercrime Bill

By assigning the task of enforcing a law relating to cyber harassment, stalking and bullying to a highly centralised federal agency with regional offices confined to Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, Quetta and Peshawar, the Ministry is failing to reach women like Naila Rind.

Around the world, as you well know Minister, cyber harassment is within the domain of the police stations.

The Ministry has fundamentally misunderstood the extent and nature of the problem. When cases turn up in these areas, there is a lack of clarity about what to do.

The law is completely misunderstood by the local police.

As you must have realised by now, Naila was driven to end her life when she constantly threatened and intimidated.

There is no support system out there for women to seek help; no emotional guidance on how to deal with gender-based threats and cyber harassment.

As a society, why do we fail to to take seriously the psychological toll of online harassment?

It has been pointed out that Sindh University had made no psychiatrists available to the students. There was no place where a student like Naila could go to seek professional help for the psychological trauma she suffered as a result of persistent blackmailing and harassment.

Dear Minister, this suicide should weigh heavy on the conscience of the authorities and the state.

The state seems to be in a rush to pass perfunctory laws such as the PECA without thinking over the implementation or plan to educate law enforcement agencies and the judiciary on the law.

Who are we making these laws for?

If these laws fail to help girls like Naila, then what use are legislative enactments and the pats on the back?

We demand from you and your Ministry:

To make the Rules related to Prevention of Electronic Crime Act 2016 public as soon as possible, and to hold public and inclusive consultations in drafting the Rules

To conduct gender sensitisation training of all relevant law enforcement authorities, including the Police and Cyber Crime Wing of FIA in the light of PECA

To equip the police and Cyber Crime Wing of FIA to deal with such complaints and make the redress mechanism speedy by investing more resources in the process (nearly half of the complaints we receive at Digital Rights Foundation’s Helpline require action by the FIA)

To appoint more women at the Cyber Crime Wing of FIA who are equipped to handle complaints of online harassment so women complainants are not subjected to victim blaming and slut shaming while they reach out to LEAs

To appoint women counselors or psychologists at the Cyber Crime Wing and police stations who can deal with the emotional trauma of victims/survivors of cyber harassment and blackmailing

Minister, in the meanwhile, till the state authorities figure out how to do their job and address this menace, please let victims of cyber harassment and blackmailing know that they can reach out to the Cyber Harassment Helpline at 0800-39393 .

Victims do not have to suffer in silence.

We are a small team but we are here to help, listen to and find solutions with you.

Sincerely,

Nighat Dad and Shmyla Khan

https://www.dawn.com/news/1322200,3/23/17 0:38,"Child sexual abuse increased by 10pc in last year, says NGO","The number of reported child sexual abuse cases in Pakistan has risen by 10 per cent in the last year, with roughly 11 children abused every day, according to a report released on Wednesday by non-government organisation (NGO) Sahil.

Sahil said in the report that a total of 4,139 cases were registered in 2016, an increase from 3,768 in 2015.

The report added that 2,410 girls and 1,729 boys were victims of sexual exploitation last year.

Some 45pc of the victims were between the ages of six and 15.

Ejaz Ahmed Qureshi, the National Commissioner for Children, said at the report’s launch that the government’s own research shows that at least 40 million children in Pakistan living below the poverty line were in dire need of protection.

Sohail Ahmed, programme officer at Sahil, proposed separate desks for reporting child abuse cases at police stations, child friendly courts and special training for all staff dealing with children including teachers, doctors, and policemen.

In 2015 Pakistan took a step towards punishing those guilty of abusing young girls with life imprisonment or even death after a parliamentary committee voted to amend current laws.

But the amendment only appears to address the sexual abuse of girls aged under 14 and not boys.

In 2015, at least 280 children were filmed being sexually abused by a gang of 25 men who used the hundreds of videos they produced to blackmail the youngsters' parents.

Most of the victims who are from Husain Khanwala village near Kasur were less than 14-years-old.

Their families had also been blackmailed by the gang since 2009.

The abusers allegedly tried to extort money from parents of victims, selling clips of the videos locally for 40 rupees each if they did not pay up.

A property dispute allegedly brought the issue to the surface.","['Aitzaz Hasan', 'Adnan Liaqat', 'Sarak Chaap', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

Sahil said in the report that a total of 4,139 cases were registered in 2016, an increase from 3,768 in 2015.
The report added that 2,410 girls and 1,729 boys were victims of sexual exploitation last year.
Sohail Ahmed, programme officer at Sahil, proposed separate desks for reporting child abuse cases at police stations, child friendly courts and special training for all staff dealing with children including teachers, doctors, and policemen.
But the amendment only appears to address the sexual abuse of girls aged under 14 and not boys.","['child', 'children', 'increased', 'sexual', 'videos', 'pakistan', 'ngo', 'cases', 'report', 'abuse', '10pc', 'girls', 'victims']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2015/08/55c85b81d304d.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2015/08/55c935f63f431.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2017/03/58d2d26a4eebf.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2015/08/55c85b81d304d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/03/58d0fce5f2ebe.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd309b711467.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2015/08/55c935f63f431.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3081f699b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd306ee076b9.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2017/03/58d0fce5f2ebe.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2017/03/58d2d26a4eebf.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Some 45pc of the victims were between the ages of six and 15.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1322200', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Child sexual abuse increased by 10pc in last year, says NGO', 'description': 'Some 45pc of the victims were between the ages of six and 15.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2017/03/58d2d26a4eebf.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1322200', 'title': 'Child sexual abuse increased by 10pc in last year, says NGO', 'description': 'Some 45pc of the victims were between the ages of six and 15.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2017/03/58d2d26a4eebf.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2017-03-23 00:38:23', 'modified_time': '2017-06-21 13:38:54', 'tag': 'Violence against children', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/4542/aitzaz-hasan'}, 'keywords': 'Violence against children', 'news_keywords': 'Violence against children', 'author': 'Aitzaz Hasan'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1532268,2/3/20 23:23,"3 Pakistanis, Macedonian man charged for allegedly holding migrants to ransom","Authorities in North Macedonia have filed criminal charges against three Pakistanis and a Macedonian man for allegedly imprisoning a group of migrants and holding them to ransom, officials said on Monday.

The prosecutor’s office said the men were believed to have behaved in a “particularly degrading and cruel” manner to the 12 migrants, including two minors, from India, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

They were allegedly detained for two weeks in October in a house in the country’s north. The four suspects were arrested last year but the arrests were announced on Monday.

According to the prosecution, the suspects “caused [the migrants] to lose their sense of time, gave them food only once a day and physically abused them”. They also allegedly demanded money from their prisoners’ relatives in other European countries and threatened to kill the migrants when they asked to be freed.

One migrant managed to contact relatives who reported the case to Serbian authorities, who in turn informed police in North Macedonia, the prosecutor’s office said.

The three Pakistanis were arrested and are in custody pending trial. If convicted, they face up to eight years in prison. The Macedonian national, who owns the house where the migrants were allegedly being held, has also been charged and is under house arrest.

North Macedonia is a key stage on the route many migrants take through the Balkans towards prosperous European countries after illegally entering neighbouring Greece — mostly on small smuggling boats from Turkey.

On the Greek island of Lesbos, where most of the boats arrive, migrants clashed with police on Monday during a protest over severe overcrowding at the local Moria camp and delays in Greece’s asylum procedure.

Riot police used tear gas to disperse several hundred protesters who had planned to march from the camp to the island capital of Mytilene, about 5 kilometres (3.1 miles) away. No arrests or injuries were reported.

Also on Monday, police in Cyprus said they safely escorted to the coastal town of Larnaca a boat with 87 Syrian migrants that had left from the Turkish port of Mersin and was spotted by radar off the island nation’s southeastern tip.

The 61 men, 10 women and 16 children were taken to a reception centre outside the capital Nicosia.","['A.

They called for an effective awareness campaign by the government for protection of children from sexual abuse. New legislation must be introduced and implementation of enforced enactments must be ensured, they suggested and said that a comprehensive rehabilitation and support system for victims of abuse must also be formed while messages should be included in the school curriculum. They demanded a provincial plan of action against the sexual abuse and exploitation must also be formed immediate.

The online statement by the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) contradicts a remark by a family planning official in the southern province of Hunan, who said last week that couples currently pregnant with a second child will not be punished, according to the Hunan Daily newspaper.

""Ahead of ratification, all localities and departments must seriously implement the population and family planning laws and regulations currently in effect, maintain good order for births and must not act of their own accord,"" an unnamed official with the commission said in the statement.

About 90 million families may qualify for the new two-child policy, which would help raise the population to an estimated 1.45 billion by 2030, the planning commission has said.

China, the world's most populous nation, had 1.37 billion people at the end of last year.

For decades, China harshly implemented the one-child policy, leading to forced abortions and infanticides across the country.

Beijing loosened the policy in late 2013, allowing couples to have a second child where one partner was an only child, but as of June, only 1.5 million of the 11 million eligible couples had applied to expand their families, the official Xinhua news agency has reported.","['Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/611583,3/8/11 2:03,UN must condemn China ‘one child’ policy: lawmaker,"WASHINGTON: UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon must step up public condemnation of China’s “one-child” policy and investigate the alleged use of forced abortions to carry it out, a key US lawmaker said Monday.

“To fail to speak out against what is by far the worst gender-based violence in history would make a mockery of the UN’s claim to promote women,” Republican Representative Chris Smith said in an appeal to Ban.

Smith also urged Ban to direct special UN envoys for violence against women, torture, and trafficking in persons to travel to China to investigate the way the policy is applied and its effects on women and girls.

China, under a 1980 policy designed to control its population, permits most couples to have only one child, an approach critics charge is backed with forced sterilizations and abortions.

The lawmaker — a long-time foe of abortion and a sharp critic of Beijing — also complained that the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) was backing China’s policy, which he described as “the most massive human rights violation in the world today” and said the agency must “cease and desist.”

A US State Department report in 2002 found “no evidence that UNFPA has knowingly supported or participated in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization” in China.

Smith also criticized President Barack Obama for hosting a state dinner for Chinese President Hu Jintao, “who oversees the most heinous attack on women ever.”

“We’re calling on the administration to make a serious attempt, which it has not made heretofore, to raise this issue” with Chinese authorities, Smith told reporters at a press conference outside the US Capitol.

“Our hope is that the White House will take this issue up in a very serious fashion — Certaintly they need to defund the UN Population Fund which is the cheerleader- and enabler-in-chief of the last 30 years of this policy,” he said.","['Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1530860,1/27/20 23:26,Man arrested for allegedly raping minor girl in Muzaffarabad,"A 23-year-old man was arrested and booked by the police on Monday for allegedly raping a minor girl in a peripheral village of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) capital, Muzaffarabad.

The alleged rape occurred in Majhotar Kelgran village in the jurisdiction of Panjgran police station on Friday evening shortly after the 12-year-old victim had entered her family's byre to tether a goat, said Station House Officer (SHO) Mir Muzammil.

Panjgran is located around 35 kilometres northeast of Muzaffarabad along the main Neelum valley road on the left bank of River Neelum, while Majhotar Kelgran village is located across the river.

The SHO said that the suspect, who lived next door to the victim’s house, followed the victim into the byre and raped her there.

The victim, according to her statement to the police, resisted and shouted but there was no one to rescue her, as her mother was not at home at the time.

The suspect threatened to kill her if she narrated the incident to anyone, the SHO said, quoting her statement.

According to SHO Muzammil, on seeing the victim in pain the following evening, her mother inquired the reason and came to know about her ordeal.

“They are a very poor family. The victim’s father is doing some odd job in Karachi and her elder teenaged brother studies in a college in Muzaffarabad,” the SHO said.

“Perhaps they were [initially] reluctant to visit a police station but did it on Monday on the insistence or suggestion of some people from their biradri (clan) or village … I consoled and assured them that police would do their best to dispense justice to them,” he added.

The SHO said the suspect was arrested from his village after police recorded the statement(s) of the victim and her mother.

“The suspect, on coming to know about the police raid, went into hiding and his family also tried to resist his arrest but we got hold of him,” he said.

On Monday afternoon, police official Chanzeb Kiani brought the victim to Shaikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahayan Hospital Muzaffarabad for medical examination which, according to a provisional report, established that she had been sexually assaulted.

“She is in severe pain,” Kiani told Dawn from the hospital.

SHO Muzammil said the suspect, who had quit school in grade V, had memorised the Holy Quran from a seminary in Bahria Town Islamabad and was acquiring religious education from a seminary in Karachi for the past six years.

He had come home around two months ago and was attending to his father’s small shop alongside their home.

The SHO said although the suspect had denied having committed any such offence, preliminary grilling substantiated that he was foreswearing.

He added that the police had registered an FIR against him on the basis of the provisional medical report.

“We have booked him under Section 10(2) of the Zina Act and Section 452 of the Criminal Procedure Code and will produce him before a judicial magistrate on Tuesday for his physical remand,” he said.","['Tariq Naqash', 'Gul Hasan', 'Naseem Altaf', 'Ibrahim S', 'Images Staff', 'Khurram Husain', 'F.S.

“The Government of Pak­istan extends due respect and courtesies and expects that the foreign envoys conform to the established diplomatic norms and principles,” the FO stated while rejecting the Afghan foreign ministry’s assertion of “mistreatment” of its envoy.

The Afghan foreign ministry had earlier alleged that its Ambassador in Islamabad Atif Mashal was summoned by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and conduct of “the entity’s personnel” was in “contradiction with diplomatic norms and principles”. The Afghan foreign ministry had not mentioned when the incident took place.

The war of words between Islamabad and Kabul over the alleged harassment of diplomats began on Sunday when Pakistan government said that officers and staff of Pakistan embassy in Kabul were “obstructed on the road and the embassy vehicles were also hit by motorcycles while going towards the embassy”. The consular section of Pakistan embassy later suspended its services.

Afghan Charge d Affaires was summoned to the FO for conveying “serious concerns” over the safety and security of the personnel of Pakistan’s diplomatic missions in Afghanistan.

The latest FO statement pointed towards continuing harassment of Pakistani diplomats and embassy staff as it said the incidents had been happening for the past few days.

“We urge the Afghan authorities to take immediate steps to ensure safety and security of the personnel of Pakistan’s diplomatic Missions in Afghanistan,” the FO added.

The Afghan foreign ministry’s statement had earlier pledged to “seriously investigate” the alleged harassment of Pakistan embassy personnel and offered assurance to provide safety to them.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1581476,9/25/20 7:25,Discontent in Lahore police over CCPO’s ‘conduct unbecoming’,"LAHORE: Many officers in the Lahore police are upset about what they say ‘aggressive and unbecoming’ conduct of newly appointed chief Umar Sheikh.

The police force panicked when the CCPO had some officials arrested and put them behind the bars while bypassing departmental procedure. He also allegedly used ‘improper words’ against senior officers in several formal and informal meetings.

Fed up with the behaviour of the Lahore CCPO, two police officials — training assistant sub inspector (T-ASI) and a head constable — complained to IGP Inam Ghani about the CCPO’s behaviour.

Meanwhile, the transfer of Lahore admin SSP Liaquat Malik late on Wednesday added fuel to fire. His transfer shocked the senior officers of the provincial capital police when they came to know that the CCPO had used improper words in his letter sent to the IGP.

The CCPO recommended to the Punjab police chief to place departmental action in the CR dossier of Mr Liaquat to disturb his promotion matter. This act further irritated the senior police officers in Lahore. He sent a copy to the Punjab chief minister too for further consideration, an action/punishment the other police officers declared excessive and uncalled for.

Mr Sheikh in the strong- worded letter mentioned Liaquat Malik as ‘irresponsible and non-professional officer’. He claimed that the SSP admin lacked ability to prepare an official presentation of a crime incident. The CCPO stated that he had asked Mr Liaquat to prepare a brief of incident of motorway gang-rape case that he (Umar Sheikh) was to present before the committee of the Senate.

The officer allegedly gave wrong details of the incident that could be embarrassing for the Punjab as well as the Lahore police, he said.

“Such presentation of distorted facts to the members of parliament standing committee on law and justice would have caused extreme embarrassment to the worthy IGP Punjab and the CCPO Lahore, called to brief the committee,” reads the official letter.

There were some reports that both sides exchanged arguments when the Lahore CCPO used ‘improper words’ against Mr Liaquat and the junior staff at a meeting a couple of days back. Following this correspondence, the admin SSP Lahore refused to work under the command of Mr Sheikh.

Consequently, the IGP transferred Mr Liaquat and posted him as assistant inspector general (AIG) discipline at the Central Police Office (CPO) against an existing vacancy late on Wednesday.

An official privy to the information said that the series of such incidents in which the CCPO adopted an aggressive policy prompted some other senior officers of the Lahore police to demand their transfer from the provincial capital to any other suitable place. He said two SSPs and an SP also approached the CPO while refusing to work under the command of the Lahore police chief.An application of police inspector and former SHO of Gujjarpura Syed Ahmad Raza Jafri is pending for approval for registration of FIR against the Lahore CCPO for the last one week or so.

CCPO Umar Sheikh said all his efforts were for the restoration of public confidence in the police force. He said his prime target are the forces resisting change.

“The police reforms are not possible unless we all overcome the forces of the status quo,” the CCPO said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1576805,8/28/20 14:43,Teacher found guilty of sexually harassing students at Lahore college,"LAHORE: A fact-finding committee has found a teacher of the Government College University (GCU) guilty of sexually harassing female students.

A member of the Old Ravian Facebook group had posted screenshots and pictures of a teacher of the GCU Physics Department and alleged [quoting a student] that she and her friends were repeatedly failed by the teacher in examinations and were also sexually harassed by him.

The Facebook group member said he decided to speak on behalf of the student who alleged that the teacher wanted to remain in contact with her and her friends.

In the post, the teacher was accused of compelling the students to attend his video calls and one of the students decided to expose him and took some screenshots in which he was shirtless and apparently drunk. The student turned off her Wi-Fi after taking the screenshots while the teacher started making calls on her mobile number and had sent messages asking her to attend the call. The post includes call logs, messages and screenshots of video calls, demanding that Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Asghar Zaidi take notice of the incident. The administration had suspended the teacher after the complaint was lodged against him in July 2020.

Prof Zaidi had ordered an inquiry into the sexual harassment complaint made on behalf of a student against a teacher of Physics Department and constituted a committee that also included a woman member.

On Thursday, the committee had submitted its report to the vice chancellor after a thorough investigation into the allegations.

The teacher was accused of sending ‘immoral’ messages [on WhatsApp] to female students and making video calls as well in inappropriate dress.

Prof Zaidi told Dawn that the committee had submitted its report.

“The report will be forwarded to the anti harassment committee to recommend imposition of penalty on the teacher,” he said.

The VC said the teacher was suspended for all types of duties soon after the filing of complaints against him. Prof Zaidi said the anti-harassment committee would submit its recommendations within a week.

“Action under PEEDA Act will also be taken against the teacher as he is found guilty of harassment,” he said.

The GCU had also terminated a teacher from service on similar charges two years ago.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1199454,8/10/15 1:49,Child abuse scandal,"AS national outrage grows and the Punjab government scrambles to try and limit the political damage from the serial child abuse in Kasur district, at the fore once again is the gross disparity between the powerful and the weak and the politicisation of law enforcement.

The terrible events that occurred over — and this is the truly horrifying aspect — many years in rural Punjab were neither a secret nor hard to unearth.

Know more :Accused says children abused in his presence

On July 8, this newspaper published a news report about the very shocking events in the area that had finally forced police to act after the villagers’ complaints and anger proved too much to ignore.

Headlined ‘15 booked for sex abuse, extortion’, the report noted: “The gang, according to the FIRs, had recorded videos while sodomising young boys and raping girls and extorted millions of rupees as well as gold jewellery from villagers since 2009.

Reportedly, the entire village was aware of the alleged offence but no one dared report it to police as the suspects were allegedly influential.”

Yet, the police only appeared to have acted under pressure from outraged locals in multiple villages around Hussain Khanwala who decided to protest publicly.

The July 8 report states, “On Saturday evening, hundreds of villagers from Rajiwala, Elowala, Bazeedpur, Kharapar, Choriwala, Nooriwala, Bhadian Usman, Ratnaiwala, Rangaywala, Bhagay, Jora, Nathaywala, and Mahalam gathered outside the Ganda Singh Police Station and demanded justice.

They even threatened with torching the houses of the suspects.” Then last Tuesday, protesters in Kasur clashed with the police — leaving at least 15 protesters and policemen injured — demanding that the police investigation into the child abuse allegations ordered after the July protest be completed quickly.

The background is important because it puts into context the initial denials of the Punjab government and senior police officials over the weekend. Once the scandal became national news, Punjab officialdom’s went into denial mode rather than be forthcoming about what was already known.

What should have happened? The horror in Kasur should have immediately led the Punjab government to revisit its entire law-enforcement strategy.

A sadistic criminal gang preying on hundreds of young boys and girls operating a stone’s throw from the seat of provincial power and able to intimidate entire communities into keeping quiet for years — why is that even possible?

Nationally, it should have immediately stirred the kind of soul searching and calls for reforms that are now being suggested by politicians seemingly willing to use the Kasur scandal to attack the PML-N or to improve their own standing with the public by coming down harshly on the perpetrators.

The real test though is what will happen when inevitably the news cycle moves on to the next topic. Will any of the politicians so eager to be heard from at the moment really do any of the hard work necessary to get reforms through?

https://www.dawn.com/news/1377787,1/19/18 19:22,"Tackling child sexual abuse: Awareness, identification and prevention","These articles have been produced in partnership with Aahung, a non-profit organisation that has been working since 1994 to improve sexual and reproductive health and rights of people in Pakistan.

Aahung works extensively on child sexual abuse through its Life Skills Based Education curriculum implemented in about 400 primary and secondary schools around the country.

The organisation works closely with teachers and caregivers on helping children stay safe and runs media campaigns to raise awareness.

Following is an account, as told to Sadia Khatri, by two para-counsellors who teach grades 4 and 5 in Karachi and have implemented Aahung’s Life Skills curriculum at their school.

There are certain topics that are difficult for children to broach – the most glaring of these is child sexual abuse. But, in the past year we have noticed a shift.

Students are becoming more vocal and are sharing their problems, both with teachers and with each other. On several occasions, students have approached us on another’s behalf.

In 2016, our school introduced Life Skills, a single-period class dedicated to discussing a range of social and psychological issues, including gender inequality and bullying.

Within Life Skills, we have been able to raise a conversation about child sexual abuse.

We want to remove misconceptions around the issue of abuse, equip children how to defend themselves, and teach them how to say “No”.

In situations where abuse is occurring, we want to encourage them to speak up about it by assuring them that there is nothing immoral about the topic.

We started off by accommodating Life Skills during our 20-minute assembly. This proved difficult. There were too many students – we have 300 in each class – and not enough time. We had to restructure the whole programme to run it smoothly.

Now, Life Skills is a slotted period in each grade – so the children know it is part of their time table, they are familiar with the teacher who takes their class, and they know exactly what to anticipate during the discussion.

The first step of the programme is to build a relationship with the students based on comfort and trust. We assure them that the conversations will remain confidential.

Before initiating the topic of abuse, we segregate the children, sending either all the boys or all the girls to art class.

This is because there are some differences in how we contextualise the lessons, especially when talking about the body.

It is also because children open up more when they are in the company of their own gender.

We start by establishing the fact that there is nothing immoral in talking about abuse. It can happen anywhere, with anyone. Some of us also experienced abuse when we were children.

If any of the students are in an unsafe situation, we encourage them to tell their parents.

We assure them that their parents will understand and support them, and that we are available to intervene if necessary.

At first, children hesitate: “We don’t have any issues, Miss. We have no problems.”

But once one or two children speak up, others begin to open up as well.

We try to create an open and safe space where they can share anything. We have to keep reminding them: our goal here is not to create fuss about your issues, or to report them anywhere.

Our goal is to help you relax and feel better. We explain to them how some problems can be resolved just by sharing them – how speaking up can be therapeutic.

Of course, not all children are comfortable verbalising their issues. To be inclusive, one of our activities involves handing out pieces of paper on which they can write down their thoughts.

We want to give them a healthy outlet. Sometimes just writing on paper is a healthy way to vent.

If they wish to share these with the teacher, they may; otherwise they are encouraged to tear up the papers and throw them away.

The idea here is to solidify trust by assuring children that they will not be forced to do anything.

Some incidents occur on the streets and at tuition centres but we have found that most abuse occurs in home spaces.

Last week, a girl confided to us in writing. She had been undergoing abuse by her cousin, who came to take care of her while her mother was away. With the girl’s consent, we offered to mediate and called in her mother.

At first, the mother was shocked. This is a common reaction – parents often find these revelations hard to believe. Sometimes they react with strong opposition, claiming that we are mistaken.

Before initiating Life Skills, we held information sessions for all parents, to ensure that we had their support.

Even though they were all on board and had given their consent, when it comes to confronting the truth, not all of them want to accept that their child is in danger.

In their minds, abuse is immoral. The log kya kahein ge [what will people say]? mentality feeds their worry – they fear for their reputation in society, and if the child is a girl, they fear for her future.

We have to assure parents that the matter will stay confidential, and that our greatest concern is their child’s safety. Eventually, they come around.

In the case of the mother last week, she believed us only once we showed her the child’s handwritten note. She could not believe that it was happening in her house.

Since then, she has become much more alert. Now she takes the child with her everywhere.

Since we usually live in close-knit neighbourhoods, it’s rare for parents to confront their child’s abuser. Their intervention is limited to heightening their child’s safety – as with this mother, who cannot say anything to her child’s abuser because they are part of the same family.

Once, another mother said to us: “I can only ensure my child’s safety. You have no idea what will happen if I take a public stand. If I accuse the abuser, he will unleash a storm in my home.”

Often children themselves are afraid of their parents. Given the gap in communication between parents and children, their fear is not misplaced.

It starts early on. When children start asking questions about changes in their body, they are either dismissed or given a nonsensical answer, or their prying is treated as something immoral.

Then there is the manner in which we talk about sex. When a child is born in the family, parents offer different, misleading explanations: one says the child came in a basket, the other says it was dropped off in the night.

Being children, they obviously consult each other and realise there are discrepancies – this heightens their curiosity and makes room for even more misleading information.

Parents’ dismissal builds mistrust, and children do not feel fully comfortable discussing everything around them.

A supportive outlet is shut off, and as a result, children going through trauma or abuse feel even more insecure.

Their mental health deteriorates and they fear admonishment from their parents. Often they begin to internalise guilt and blame themselves, afraid that if their parents find out, they will be held responsible.

There are several changes that parents must make in their behaviour.

First, they need to talk openly with their children, and resist the impulse to sweep sensitive topics under the carpet.

Second, parents must stay informed and involved in their children’s day-to-day activities.

You should know where your child is going and with whom they are spending their time.

One way to solidify trust is to create a habit. For example, ask your child how their day went before they go to sleep at night.

Your child might not always have a lot to share, but at least they will realise that there is space for them to speak to you.

Once they know that you care, they will begin to feel safe discussing anything with you.

Lastly, believe your children. Your child should feel confident confiding in you.

They should not approach you with the fear of admonishment, but with the conviction that they will be believed.

Implementing the Life Skills programme has not been a smooth process. Selecting teachers is the key challenge.

When the course was introduced, many teachers were initially hesitant taking it on and felt the content was too sensitive.

Untrained teachers cannot run these classes, so all of us first have to undergo training by Aahung.

But workshops aside, teachers first need to have the confidence that is required to discuss abuse.

They need to be emotionally well-equipped to talk to children. This is not always the case.

Some female teachers have trouble with boys. Others, who had received the training, backed off when it was time to deliver.

We are six teachers handling grades 4 and 5. There are also teachers who run Life Skills sessions at the secondary school. At least through our efforts, some of the children are now safe.

But the process does not end there. Children can be fragile even after they are out of danger. Sometimes you have to provide extra care.

For example, there is a girl who often shows up out of nowhere to see us. We know she has been through abuse, so we never turn her away.

Sometimes she wants to share something simple – nothing related to her trauma. But we know that she is seeking comfort and that it is important for her to be listened to.

Furthermore, we have to ensure that students who have experienced abuse feel safe in their new classes.

If they have a trusting relationship with a particular teacher, we try to adjust their class so they don’t have to deal with anyone new.

At the beginning of the school year, there was a student who refused to sit in her new class. When we placed her back with her former teacher, she calmed down again.

Delivering the Life Skills workshops can be a challenging experience, but the teachers who have been implementing the programme have seen how vital and transformative it can be for children who are being abused or are survivors of abuse.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1341457,6/24/17 7:12,Police told to add honour killing sections to attempted murder case,"ISLAMABAD: The National Commission on Human Rights (NCHR) has directed the capital police to incorporate honour killing sections in an FIR registered against a man for opening fire on his teenage cousin in the Nilore village in order to prevent the chance of pardon or settlement within the family.

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) on June 14 drew attention of the NCHR towards the attempted honour killing.

A letter sent by the HRCP to the NCHR stated that on June 9 a girl, aged between 16 and 17, was shot thrice allegedly by her cousin in the Nilore village.

It said seven months ago the father of the girl, who belonged to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and was settled in Nilore, decided to marry her off to a man much older than her.

However, the girl left her home with a boy belonging to a local community.

Four days later, the couple was caught at Khanna Pul and brought back home.

The girl was beaten and locked up inside the home. On June 9, the letter claimed, the girl’s cousin shot her and fled.

National Commission on Human Rights (NCHR) issues direction to prevent chances of pardon or settlement within family

Her father filed an FIR with the Nilore police the same day but the accused could not be arrested.

The victim is under treatment at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims).

On June 15, she was operated upon and a bullet which had pierced into her throat was removed successfully. She has now started communicating with her family through writing and also recorded her statement with the police.

On Thursday, NCHR Chairman retired Justice Ali Nawaz Chowhan along with members from Islamabad, KP and Balochistan heard the case at its head office. Police officers and doctors from Pims briefed the commission about the case.

Pims medico-legal officer Dr Naseema said when the victim was brought to the hospital she was in a very critical condition but now she was a bit stable and her condition improving.

Justice Chowhan said honour killing was totally against human rights and freedom and liberty of a person and such acts should be condemned by the public at large and there should be strict punishments for the offenders.

He directed the police to add the specific sections of the law relating to honour killing to the FIR to prevent the chances of pardon or settlement within the family.

The police assured the meeting that the sections would be added and added that efforts were being made to arrest the suspect.

Raja Qaiser Ghaffar, the chairman of Union Council 7 (Pind Begwal), told Dawn that three bullets were shot at the girl: one entered her throat, the second hit her chest and the third pierced her ribs.

“It seemed a pre-planned attempt of murder because after the incident efforts were made to hush up the incident. On the other hand, police were also not pressed to arrest the suspect,” he said.

On the other hand, he added, the girl in her written statement claimed that her cousin tried to kill her and she did not want to forgive him, he said.

“I am against underage marriages. The girl was only 16 and was being married to a man as old as her father. I believe that no girl should be married against her will. Moreover, girls less than 18 years of age should not be allowed to get married,” he said.

“In the rural areas around Islamabad, honour killings or attempted honour killings are not infrequent. Something needs to be done about this.

“Whenever such an incident takes place, the state should intervene and the victim should be placed under the state guardianship. This is the only way to prevent inter-family and inter-community compromises in which the victim is simply disregarded,” Mr Ghaffar said.

Inayatullah, an official of the Nilore police, told Dawn that though the incident had taken place in the heat of the moment police had decided to take strict action against the suspect.

“The father of the suspect was called to the police station on Thursday and he promised to produce the suspect after Eidul Fitr. However, it is a family issue and sooner or later it will be settled,” he said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1560352,5/30/20 6:50,Police performance,"POLICE performance, not just in Pakistan but across the world, is rightly scrutinised by the public and other relevant stakeholders. The recent steps being taken by the inspector general, Punjab Police, reflect a new mechanism to assess field officers’ performance as reported by this paper on April 29. Any steps to improve performance must be lauded but the evaluation regime recently introduced appears to be an innovation to tackle a complex issue. Performance will be used to decide future postings etc of senior officers through awarding positive and negative points. Whilst at first sight, and in principle, this seems appropriate, there is a fundamental problem with using such a narrow set of metrics and over such a short period. Crime is rarely impacted so quickly by police actions.

The debate, even arguments, about what and how performance should be assessed is an ongoing one. For example, should it be about attaching priority to assessing property crimes, eg vehicle, residential and commercial property crime, or crimes against the person, eg murder/attempted murder, kidnapping, sexual assault, or white collar crime, or a combination of offences? Who should decide? What criteria should be used? Further, there needs to be a delineation between assessment of an individual district/city police officer’s personal performance and the overall performance of their district or city.

Meaningful and effective performance management should have its focus on outcomes.

In order to tackle crime effectively, there should be an effective response to reported crime but also proactive actions by police to investigate crimes that are occurring but are usually not reported, eg drug trafficking and money laundering. The latter usually lie in the domain of organised crime syndicates. In order to paint a picture and understand what is going on with organised crime there has to be good intelligence available. This requires proper structures, information security, analysis and then action. In essence, police action is much more effective when you tackle the criminal rather than the crime as criminals are extremely adaptive. They look at opportunities to make money and are not too bound by crime types but rather view them as commodities. For example, crime syndicates will collaborate where it is in their interest to do so — they may ordinarily be competitors but under certain circumstances, collaboration serves their mutual interest.

Further, if individual officers are to be held accountable they need to be given the tools and freedom to adapt policing in their areas under a corporate framework set by the IGP from the central police office. This can only be done if there is security of tenure for officers from top to bottom. That is not to say poor performance is tolerated through security of tenure but rather interventions are put in place to support and challenge the district police to improve their performance. Ultimately poor performance has to have sanctions but these need to be set out at the outset in the interest of transparency.

There is temptation to focus on performance that is easy to measure, eg the number of stolen vehicles. Just as important are qualitative measures, eg data needs to be collected about both the public’s perception and the reality of interactions with police. A district with a good detection rate for acquisitive crime might be totally failing in its interactions with the public. So how is this reflected in performance assessment?

Meaningful and effective performance management should have its focus on outcomes and not simply be a measure of police activity. Two examples illustrate this point: One, the simplistic metric around the submission of DNA samples could provide perverse incentives without adding any value to police performance. If samples are taken where they will not add value to the investigation they will simply be a waste of resources, but, superficially, a district’s performance will look good because samples would have been submitted in a higher proportion of cases. Instead, the measures should be about positive outcomes achieved from the submission of samples.

Two, the number of challans submitted is, rightly, an important measure but what is the quality of the evidence on which the indictment is based? Police themselves decide when there is sufficient evidence to submit a challan but there is no independent evaluation of that evidence to determine whether the case justifies a trial. This can lead to police performance looking more positive than it really is if cases going to court are weak and therefore not able to be successfully prosecuted. One only has to look at verdicts from the higher courts where cases from the lower courts have been appealed to find that the conviction was based on weak, sometimes flimsy evidence. This state of affairs serves the interests of neither the victims nor the defendants nor criminal justice as a whole.

It is also important to look at the ‘health’ of the organisation itself, ie the number of complaints against police officers in the district, especially police stations — officers suspended and awarded minor or major punishments. Moreover, public perception survey data needs to be collected regarding the performance of officers themselves and their organisation. This can be done at various levels.

All this is not something that can be done overnight as it needs resources, and a change in culture and structures. The IGP Punjab has taken important first steps but if meaningful performance management is to become part of how the Punjab Police (or others) do business then a lot more changes are required. These changes will not be easy and can only be delivered if the majority of the organisation, at least, buys into delivering that change. For that to happen, staff across all ranks need to be remunerated properly and have terms and conditions of service that deal with their well-being. Above all, they must have self-esteem. The latter will only happen if they are treated with dignity both by their own organisation and the public at large.

This is a tall order but would anyone of us accept anything less for ourselves?

https://www.dawn.com/news/1272833,7/24/16 6:49,Loopholes persist in 'honour killing' bill,"ISLAMABAD: The proposed legislation on honour killings has introduced strict punishment for the convicts making it tougher than the ordinary murder cases.

However, legal experts are of the view that after killing a relative in the name of honour, a person may declare it a simple murder to avoid the punishment.

Under the existing law, a murderer can be released after the legal heirs pardon him. But the proposed legislation on honour killings recommends 25 years’ imprisonment even if the heirs of the victim pardon the convict. Under Section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), the convict in a simple murder case may get the life imprisonment of 14 years or a maximum of the death penalty.

Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, a criminal law expert and the president of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association, said the legislation on honour killings would not achieve the desired results as the accused may claim that he had committed the murder for other reasons such as a dispute over property etc. Hence, he may be charged with Section 302 of the PPC and the family members may pardon him under Section 309 of the PPC.

Experts suggest amending law of evidence, put onus on judges

Moreover, in honour killing cases the police as well as the courts follow the same procedure and rely on the same evidence as they would require in ordinary murder cases.

The collection of evidence in honour killing cases is very difficult and this is the reason a person after killing his daughter, sister or mother cannot be convicted, he said.

He suggested that the lawmakers should amend Qanoon-i-Shahadat (the law of evidence) for honour killing cases and the standard of evidence should be relaxed which would increase the possibility of conviction.

Instead of direct evidence – testimonies of the witnesses – reliance should be made on the circumstantial evidence which may be the electronic evidence or other related facts.

The Anti-Honour Killings Laws (Criminal Laws Amendment) Bill 2015 and the Anti-Rape Laws (Criminal Laws Amendment) Bill 2015, initially moved by former senator of the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Sughra Imam as private members’ bills, were passed by the Senate two years ago.

But the government failed to get the bills passed by the National Assembly within the stipulated 90 days and later had to include them on the agenda of a joint sitting of parliament, which had actually been convened to get the PIA conversion bill passed.

The honour killings bill aims at preventing killing of women in the name of honour by making the crime a non-compoundable offence.

When contacted, Senator Saeed Ghani, who was a member of the committee which cleared the bill, told Dawn that honour killings had certain distinctions. He explained that in a simple murder case the deceased may not be a family member.

The investigation officer may ascertain whether the murder was honour killing or otherwise, he said.

Barrister Zafarullah Khan, the special assistant to the prime minister who headed the government legal team which drafted the law, said it was the responsibility of the court to make a distinction between a simple murder and an honour killing.

He said: “The judge will decide whether it is a simple murder or a murder in the name of honour.”

The collection of evidence in honour killing cases is very difficult and this is the reason a person after killing his daughter, sister or mother cannot be convicted, he said.
The honour killings bill aims at preventing killing of women in the name of honour by making the crime a non-compoundable offence.
When contacted, Senator Saeed Ghani, who was a member of the committee which cleared the bill, told Dawn that honour killings had certain distinctions.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1586630,10/23/20 19:29,"Karachi court issues warrants for cleric, others in case involving rape, abduction and illicit marriage of minor girl","A Karachi court has taken cognisance of the marriage of an underage Christian girl, who was allegedly abducted and raped after being forcibly converted to Islam, it emerged on Friday.

The judge issued bailable warrants for the arrest of cleric Qazi Mufti Ahmed Jaan Raheemi — who allegedly performed the marriage of the girl when she was a teenager, her husband Muhammad Imran and his relatives Muhammad Rehan Baloch, Sundus and Azra. The suspects will be able to secure bail against a surety of Rs10,000 each, according to the judgement.

Police had booked five suspects, including two women, in a case pertaining to the alleged abduction and rape of the girl in Ittehad Town locality. The main suspect, Imran, was subsequently arrested.

The court's order came after the victim lodged a complaint against the suspects — including Imran, Baloch, Sundus, Azra and Raheemi — under Sections 3 (punishment for male contracting party), 4 (punishment for solemnising a child marriage) and 5 (punishment for parent or guardian concerned in a child marriage) of the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act, 2013.

Read: Age of consent

The matter came up before judicial magistrate (West) Wajid Ali Channa, who observed that the victim had recorded her statement under Section 200 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) while the statements of the witnesses had also been recorded in the case.

The judge noted that the statements of the witnesses duly supported the complainant's statement. “On careful examination of the statements recorded during preliminary inquiry, it appears that the complainant in her statement stated that she is less than 13 years [old] and she was not willing in the nikah with the accused Muhammad Imran.”

He further noted that the “nikah was solemnised without her consent under pressure, coercion and influence. Hence [...] the offence under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act, 2013, read with Section 200 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, is prima facie made out against the accused persons namely Muhammad Imran, Muhammad Rehan, Mst Sundus, Mst Azra and Qazi Mufti Ahmed Jaan Raheemi.”

The judge further observed that under the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act, 2013, the marriage of either party who is less than 18 years old is prohibited. ""In the circumstances, cognisance of the offence under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act, 2013, is hereby taken. Let the private complaint be admitted and brought on regular file and registered,” he ordered.

The judge directed the court office to issue bailable warrants for the arrest of the suspects and directed the suspects to ensure their presence before the court on October 26.

The complainant was told to file a list of the witnesses and obtain certified copies of their statements. The court asked the office to also provide copies of the documentary evidence to the suspects by the next date of the hearing.

Case history

In May 2019, three of the five suspects in the cases had easily escaped from the court after an additional district and sessions judge recalled the pre-arrest bail granted to them against a surety of Rs30,000 each.

The judge had noted at the time that according to the case record, the complainant was a minor. Recording her statement before the judicial magistrate, the victim had denied accepting Islam and execution of her free will in performing her nikah with suspect Imran.

The judge further stated that “she deposed that they (suspects) forcibly obtained her signatures on plain papers and the co-accused committed zina with her.”

Initially, a case was registered under Sections 365-B (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel for marriage etc), 376 (punishment for rape), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Ittehad Town police station on the complaint of the victim.","['Naeem Sahoutara', 'Niamet Ladak', 'A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1121441,7/25/14 5:26,Landlord’s son arrested for ‘chopping off’ boy’s arms,"GUJRAT: Police claimed to have arrested on Thursday a landlord’s son who allegedly chopped off both arms of a young boy by pushing him on to a running water pumping machine in Chak Bhula village.

According to police, the accused has confessed that he had thrown the boy on to the water pump after tying his hands.

Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif took notice of the incident and sought a report from the Gujrat police and the district administration.

According to sources, landlord Ghulam Ghous and Nasir Iqbal, the boy’s father, had a dispute over getting an electricity transformer repaired as farmlands and outhouses of their families were in the same neighbourhood.

Shahzad was taken to the Aziz Bhatti Shaheed Hospital, where he was given treatment and later sent home.

The family of the boy reported the matter to police on July 22. Police asked them to first produce a medico-legal report.

Age-appropriate communication with children about child sexual abuse is among one of the key protective measures that adults can undertake.

The implications of not giving age-appropriate information and transferring skills to children can be very damaging.

Silence on this issue can perpetuate further abuse, and leave children suffering over long periods of time for something that can be stopped with timely intervention.

Having worked in Pakistan with both child and adult survivors of sexual abuse, I observed that individuals who were provided basic body protection information as children or timely support by adults after an incident reported fewer clinical complications than those who disclosed abuse for the first time during therapy.

An oft-asked question is about when, what and how to broach this subject with children so that they are not left feeling scared and overwhelmed.

What is the right age to start the conversation?

Having conducted awareness sessions with children of all ages, I found that the more comfortable, open and engaging an adult was, the more comfortable a child became in speaking and openly asking questions.

Children as young as three years old can learn basic age-appropriate information and skills. The right information about body safety and the opportunity to practice skills for dealing with potentially abusive situations are two important aspects of an effective awareness programme for children.

Children aged 3 to 5 years need to learn the basics, i.e. the difference between a good, bad and secret touch; the role of feelings in determining this difference; what to do and most importantly which adult to tell.

Confidently saying ‘no’, shouting out for help, talking to a trusted adult are some of the skills practiced with children.

Stories through books, puppets and cartoons can further reinforce this information.

For children aged 5 to 7 years, basic information about bodily rights, private parts, difference between safe and unsafe situations, assertive communication skills and practice of skills through role-plays should be additionally covered.

An important thing taught to children is to identify more than one person who they can talk to, just in case an adult is unavailable or is unable to believe them. This helps build a support network for children.

Since anyone can be an abuser, with most being someone that the child knows, the emphasis of information should be on the abuse itself, regardless of who the person is.

For children older than 7 years, some myths should be clarified. For example, children should know that abusers are rarely strangers or that boys can also be sexually abused, or that abusers do not always physically threaten children but lure through affection and gifts.

What kind of information should be shared?

Various forms of abuse including vulnerability through cyberspace should be shared with children. Teenagers, for example, should be provided additional information about consent and respect in relationships.

Children with special needs should not be left out of these discussions, since evidence indicates them being more vulnerable to sexual abuse.

Being vigilant and aware of the adults around the child and their nature of interaction with them can be a helpful and protective measure, especially for those with mental disabilities.

Most importantly, no matter what the age, children need to be clearly and repeatedly told that the fault for the abuse does not lie with them, even if they have accepted gifts, enjoyed the abuser’s company, or could not say ‘no’, etc.

Building children’s overall self-esteem, providing them opportunities to express their opinions and think critically can be considered as important foundations for the work on body protection for both girls and boys.

The importance of two-way communication

Providing information through open, two-way communication that allows children to share their views and feelings about the issue is extremely critical. This allows adults to find out what children already know and what needs to be clarified.

When adults give this information in the form of a lecture, or in a manner where children sense that the onus of responsibility for preventing abuse lies on them, there are more chances that they will not disclose such incidents.

Adults may not always be around and children may not always be able to speak to adults due to feelings of shame, fear, helplessness, and their relationship with the abuser.

Always try and take out time to talk to children about their day-to-day activities, their feelings, their challenges and achievements.

This can further create an overall atmosphere of trust and confidence enabling them to talk about difficult issues.

How to identify signs of sexual abuse in children

There is no single indicator of sexual abuse, since abuse can be of many different forms and may affect children differently.

However, any sudden change in a child’s behaviour, academic performance, sleep, appetite or emotions, for which no other reason can be found, should alert an adult to the possibility of sexual abuse.

In addition, age-inappropriate sexual information, sexual acting-out with peers, toys, adults, and inexplicable bruises or marks on the body should also be investigated.

Adults often feel anger, guilt and helplessness at a child’s disclosure of abuse. Blaming the child, scolding her for not revealing the issue earlier or asking her to not discuss or forget about it are unhelpful and detrimental responses.

Sensitive and effective ways to respond to a child’s disclosure of the abuse include listening openly, appreciating and not blaming the child, and normalising the feelings evoked by abuse.

Necessary steps for ensuring the child’s safety should also be taken. For example, helping him develop a safety plan in case he comes across the same situation, confronting or reporting the abuser, and blocking access of the abuser.

This becomes complicated when the abuser is related to the child. However, calling out on the abuse and taking safety measures are essential.

If critical thinking, values, self-confidence and life skills are essential for children’s personality, then bodily safety and protection should be seen as part and parcel of that development.

While the need for effective laws, sensitive reporting and response mechanisms in Pakistan cannot be denied, it would be negligent not to do our bit by empowering children through basic safety and protective measures.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1380063,1/1/18 7:23,41 women killed for ‘honour’ in Gujrat in 2017,"GUJRAT: As many as 41 women were murdered on the pretext of ‘preserving honour’ and over domestic disputes in Gujrat during 2017.

The number has increased from the previous year’s 35. In 2013, around 51 women were murdered followed by 36 in 2014.

According to data collected from the district police office, most of the women had been slain by their kin and the complainants in these cases were also family members. However, there was no conviction in these cases as the complainants would reconcile with the suspects.

Most of these murders occurred in rural areas in the jurisdictions of Jalalpur Jattan Saddar, Kunjah, Daulat Nagar and Dinga police stations. The police stations in recently urbanised areas located in the outskirts of the city also reported an alarming number of cases of violence against women. Three women of a family were killed for ‘honour’ in the Civil Lines police precincts besides a few others over the year.

There were 38 cases of women’s murders reported to various police stations in 2017 as compared to 34 in 2016. Some unidentified bodies were also recovered during the last year who did not belong to Gujrat district, including the recently solved blind murder of a woman who belonged to Rawalpindi.

Women were also killed over marriage disputes, domestic issues and various other reasons. A senior police investigation officer told Dawn that he believed culture and traditions were the main reason behind violence against women. He stressed effective legislation and awareness campaigns to contain such violence.

He added that out of the 38 registered cases, suspects nominated in 36 had been arrested and sent behind bars, but such suspects would often be released on technical grounds mainly due to pardoning by and reconciliation with complainants, who were mostly the victim’s relatives.

Prof Dr Muhammad Nizamuddin, chairman of the Punjab Higher Education Commission, says Pakistan had high prevalence of violence against women owing to various factors such as a patriarchal society where gender inequality at various levels was accepted as a norm. Men had assumed higher status in society irrespective of caste, creed, finance and education, he stressed.

“Pakistani society is complex with various ethnic groups, but when it comes to gender inequality almost all groups, classes and sects seem to follow this rule -- although intensity varies. Men are taught that they are superior, and the structure of society has been evolved and developed to give men more power. This unequal power lies at the root of violence against women,” he explained.

This unequal power lies at the root of violence against women,” he explained.","['gujrat', '41', '2017', 'society', 'violence', 'cases', 'stations', 'complainants', 'men', 'various', 'women', 'honour', 'suspects', 'killed']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd337468dd26.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2017/10/59eb16270250a.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/11/59f983a6ea909.jpg?r=262656272', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2017/11/59f983a6ea909.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2017/12/5a465c5be5176.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2018/01/5a49bb53740f5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/10/59eb16270250a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/12/5a465c5be5176.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2018/01/5a49bb53740f5.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'The number has increased from the previous year’s 35.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1380063', 'type': 'article', 'title': '41 women killed for ‘honour’ in Gujrat in 2017', 'description': 'The number has increased from the previous year’s 35.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2018/01/5a49bb53740f5.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1380063', 'title': '41 women killed for ‘honour’ in Gujrat in 2017', 'description': 'The number has increased from the previous year’s 35.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2018/01/5a49bb53740f5.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2018-01-01 07:23:50', 'modified_time': '2018-01-01 09:39:38', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/951/waseem-ashraf-butt'}, 'author': 'Waseem Ashraf Butt'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1581140,9/23/20 7:08,Missing Sikh girl reunited with family in Attock,"TAXILA: A 22-year-old Sikh girl, who recently went missing under mysterious circumstances from her home, was reunited with her family on Tuesday, proving that theories about her abduction as well as forced conversion were mere propaganda, police sources said.

The girl went missing in Attock district’s Hassanabdal city, which is home to famous Sikh temple Gurdwara Punja Sahib, at around 10pm on Aug 31.

Her father, in his FIR lodged with the Hassanabdal police station, said his daughter had gone to a dump garbage in the street at 10pm on Aug 31, but did not return home.

He said that when the family couldn’t find her, he lodged a complaint with the Hassan­abdal police station which subsequently registered a case under Section 365-B of the Pakistan Penal Code for kidnapping, abduction or inducing a woman to marry, and launched a hunt for the missing girl.

During the investigation, the police zeroed in on one suspect who was released after initial questioning. The family expressed fears that she might have converted to Islam and married a Muslim man.

However, all such fears proved to be baseless when the girl was reunited with her family at the Attock district police office. The young woman in her video statement raised Sikh religious slogans, along with her family, including father and mother. “Jo bolay so Nehal, Sat Sari Akal,” they chanted.

The Indian media had played up the issue and termed the incident “a case of forced conversion”. The Indian media’s fake propaganda triggered demonstrations staged by some Sikh organisations such as Delhi’s Shiromani Akali Dal Unit and Delhi’s Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee outside the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi against the alleged kidnapping.

Moreover, according to media reports, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs also summoned an official of the Pakistan High Commission over the issue.

In his statement, the father, who runs a herbal shop in Hassanabdal, thanked the government and Attock police for the safe and early recovery of his missing daughter. He said he was happy that his daughter was safely reunited with her family with her religion intact.

Representatives of the Sikh community also lauded efforts of the police and support of the federal and provincial governments as well as the Evacuee Trust Property Board and the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee for making untiring efforts for the safe and early recovery of the girl.

Talking to Dawn, District Police Officer Syed Khalid Hamdani said that police teams’ weeks-long efforts proved fruitful and the Sikh girl was safely handed over to her father and mother after fulfilling legal requirements as she recorded her statement in a local court under Section 166 on Tuesday.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1580178,9/17/20 19:51,"WDD Punjab, UN Women launch implementation framework to support gender mainstreaming in govt departments","The Women Development Department (WDD) Punjab and UN Women Pakistan launched Punjab Women Development Policy (PWDP) 2018 Implementation Framework on Thursday with an objective to integrate gender focused activities in the workplans of all government departments and institutions to ensure gender mainstreaming in provincial planning.

The provincial government developed the PWDP 2018 to systematically eradicate all manifestations of explicit and implicit gender discrimination across all spheres of society and address the whole range of women development concerns and challenges in line with the spirit of the Constitution, Pakistan’s international commitments and priorities of the provincial government to pursue the goal of gender mainstreaming and women empowerment in Punjab.

The policy has seven key sectoral strategies, namely Women Political Empowerment and Rights Based Governance; Women and Education/Skills Development, Women and Health; Women Poverty Reduction and Economic Empowerment; Gender Based Violence; Women and Climate Change and last but not the least Women and ICT.

The implementation framework provides a set of activities, their monitoring and evaluation plan keeping within these strategic areas. The framework was finalised after a long process of individual and group consultations and validation workshops, repeatedly engaging with all 36 departments.

Minister Women Development Ashifa Riaz Fatyana, in her keynote address expressed her optimism that the framework will play a key role in changing realities in women’s favour in the province. She added that poor implementation is often the cause for lack of success of any policy. This document spells out roles and responsibilities and provides one platform to all departments in Punjab for measuring success and chalking a way forward.

Ambreen Raza, Secretary WDD, said, “This framework will bring us closer to our vision of a gender-sensitive Punjab, where women and men enjoy equity and equality in all walks of life; women and girls are able to fulfill their roles towards achieving and enjoying individual and collective well-being, development and prosperity without any explicit or implicit discrimination.”

Sidra Minhas, Consultant UN Women, presented highlights of the framework identifying gender disaggregated data collection, capacity building and awareness as key activities for all relevant departments.

Jacqui Ketunuti, Deputy Country Representative UN Women Pakistan, in her opening remarks, said, “It is a matter of great pride for us that, with the strong and capable leadership of the WDD, 36 provincial departments came together and endorsed the integration of activities in their workplans to ensure that Punjab can make progress on gender equality in the thematic areas of political empowerment, education, health, economic empowerment, gender-based violence, climate change and ICT. This is the first and largest such initiative for gender mainstreaming in the province.”

Saman Ahsan, Portfolio Manager EVAW, Governance & Human Rights UN Women Pakistan, said, “UN Women and Women Development Department form a natural alliance as we both work on same agenda of women empowerment and gender equality. The framework is one commendable result that came out of this collaboration. We will continue to work together for our mutual goals and objective.”","['Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1469181,3/12/19 12:21,"FIR registered against men suspected of raping, filming 17-year-old boy in Mandi Bahauddin","The Mandi Bahauddin police on Monday registered a first information report (FIR) against a group of men accused of raping a young boy while filming the assault.

According to information received by DawnNewsTV, the incident had occurred in February 2018, but was not reported by the boy — who was 17 at the time — or his family as the men had been threatening to release the video of the rape on social media.

According to the FIR, the main accused and his accomplices had taken the young man to a deserted area of the Kot Baloch area of Mandi Bahauddin. The young man was then raped while being filmed.

Hearing the boy scream, his father and cousin — who had already been searching for him — came to the deserted area where the crime was taking place. The culprits fled the scene when they heard the two men approaching.

The boy and his family decided to remain silent about the incident, in hopes of ""maintaining their respect in the locality"".

According to the FIR, the group then repeatedly extorted money from the victim and his family by holding the video over their head.

However, last week, the gang released the video on social media and according to the FIR, many people in the town had seen it ""as it went viral"".

The FIR has been registered under Section 292 A, 377 and 367 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).

Section 292 A of the PPC deals with exposing children to seduction. Section 377 deals with unnatural offences and Section 367 deals with kidnapping with the intent to subject a person to grave harm.

No arrests have been made so far; however, the district police officer of the area said that the police is searching for the culprits and they will be severely punished once found.","['Zaheer Abbas Sial', 'Kashif Ajaz', 'Syed Hassan Haseeb', 'Azhar Ali', 'Ataullah Khan', 'Ali Vazir', 'Adeel Ikram', 'Dr. Salaria', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Sami Ullah']","The Mandi Bahauddin police on Monday registered a first information report (FIR) against a group of men accused of raping a young boy while filming the assault.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1425813,8/9/18 6:53,Karachi police chief sent packing after officials found involved in witnesses’ harassment,"KARACHI: Inspector General of Police, Sindh, Amjad Javed Saleemi on Wednesday removed Karachi police chief Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar and posted Additional IG Dr Amir Ahmed Shaikh in his place.

The decision came amid reports that powerful quarters were unhappy over the role of Karachi police in an FIA-mandated money laundering case against Pakistan Peoples Party co-chairman Asif Zardari, his sister Faryal Talpur and many others.

New Karachi police chief Dr. Amir Ahmed Shaikh.

Besides some junior police officials, another senior officer, SSP East Mohammad Nauman Siddiqui, was also transferred by the IGP.

While officials remained tight-lipped over the development, sources at the Central Police Office (CPO) said that the action was taken in the light of the findings of a probe carried out on the directives of the Supreme Court.

On Aug 6, a three-judge SC bench headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar had taken up a suo motu case regarding fake accounts involving Rs35bn alleged money laundering. During the hearing, the FIA director general alleged that the Sindh police were harassing witnesses. The apex court ordered IG Saleemi to look into the matter and furnish a report.

Some officials say Mushtaq Mahar was ‘punished’ for political reasons; Amir Shaikh new police chief

The sources said that the IGP asked Additional IG Dr Aftab Pathan to conduct an inquiry into the allegations of harassment against policemen.

They said several policemen appeared before the inquiry officer at the CPO and ‘admitted’ that they stayed at the house of a woman, who is a witness in the money laundering case, for up to six hours, contradicting the account of a senior police officer who told the IGP that the police stayed for merely “10 to 15 minutes” at her house in Gulistan-i-Jauhar to serve the summons.

The sources said that the IGP expressed his extreme displeasure against the senior police officer for ‘covering up’ the incident.

AIG Mahar says he requested for transfer

While Mr Mahar had just completed his three-year term as the Karachi police chief, on Wednesday the IGP transferred him and posted Additional IG finance, logistics and welfare Amir Ahmed Shaikh in his place.

Mr Mahar told Dawn that he had already completed his three-year tenure as the Karachi police chief and only two days after the general elections he asked the IGP and the Sindh government to transfer him.

He was appointed in July 2015 as the city police chief. Two years later, he was transferred and posted as city traffic police chief. But he returned to his previous post in just five weeks.

A notification issued by the IG reads: “In exercise of the authority conferred vide para 96(c) of the judgement of Honourable High Court of Sindh dated Sept. 7, 2017 in C.P. (No. D-7097 of 2016 and C.P. D-131 of 2017), Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar, a PSP (BS-21), additional inspector general of police, Karachi range is transferred and directed to report to Central Police Office Sindh, Karachi.”

Another notification stated that Dr Amir Ahmed Shaikh — a PSP officer (BS-21) — was posted with immediate effect and until further orders as the Karachi police chief.

SSP East Nauman Siddiqui, a PSP officer (BS-19), was also transferred and directed to report to the CPO through another notification. Shikarpur SSP Jahanzeb Nazir Khan was transferred and posted as the new SSP East.

Controversy

However, controversy surrounded the IGP’s decision to send Mr Mahar, an officer of good repute, packing as those against the decision found it politically motivated.

They said that Mr Mahar was punished only for performing his duties as a police team had served notices at the houses of the suspects facing the Rs35bn money laundering case.

They added that the FIA did not have required force and they merely pasted notices/summons at the Bilawal House in Clifton and Ms Talpur’s house in Defence and just took its pictures.

They said that in compliance with the SC directions, the Gulistan-i-Jauhar and Gizri police forcefully served the summons to ensure their appearance in court in Islamabad in the case.

However, a senior police officer conceded that the police might “overdo” things in order to ensure compliance of the apex court’s order.

The senior officer said that instead of transferring the Karachi police chief an FIR could have been registered against such policemen for harassment.

He said senior police officials ‘resisted’ action against their junior fellows who were merely complying with the SC orders.

Meanwhile, the newly appointed city police chief said curbing street crimes and improving emergency response of the police to address citizens’ complaints would be some of his top priorities.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1243924,3/6/16 17:11,Woman burnt alive in India 'honour killing',"JAIPUR: A woman was burnt to death by her brothers for marrying a man belonging to a different caste, police said Sunday, in the latest incident of a so-called honour killing in India.

Rama Kunwar, 30, had eloped with her lover eight years ago and returned to her village in western Rajasthan state on Friday, hoping her family had forgiven her for marrying against their wishes.

But her still enraged brothers barged in as she was visiting her in-laws' house and dragged her outside before setting her on fire as other villagers watched.

“She thought that her parents would now accept her but as soon as her brothers came to know that she was in the village, they rushed to that house and dragged her out,” Brijran Singh, a senior administrative officer of Dungarpur district, told AFP.

“She cried for help but no one came to rescue her. They also conducted the funeral on the same night to destroy evidence,” he said.

Kunwar's mother-in-law however alerted the police who reached the spot and doused the funeral pyre in order to collect evidence.

One of Kunwar's brothers and six other men have been arrested. Authorities are still searching for an unspecified number of suspects, Singh added.

Honour killings – where couples are targeted because their families or communities disapprove of their relationships – have been carried out for centuries in India, especially in rural areas.

They are carried out by close relatives or village elders to protect what is seen as the family's reputation and pride in a hereditary-based caste system.

India's Supreme Court in 2011 ruled those involved in honour killings should face the death penalty.","['Kamal Pasha.', 'Ali', 'Ca', 'Haque Parast', 'Indian Wolfie', 'N K Ali', 'Abdulla Hussain', 'Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman']","JAIPUR: A woman was burnt to death by her brothers for marrying a man belonging to a different caste, police said Sunday, in the latest incident of a so-called honour killing in India.

India's Supreme Court in 2011 ruled those involved in honour killings should face the death penalty.","['house', 'india', 'funeral', 'marrying', 'burnt', 'alive', 'village', 'woman', 'brothers', 'death', 'killings', 'dragged', 'honour', 'killing', 'singh']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2014/12/548dd136c4cf2.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2014/12/548dd136c4cf2.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2016/02/56cca7ac7fe81.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd329902b790.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/02/56cca7ac7fe81.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/large/2016/03/56dc1faf1dbed.jpg'}",TRUE,http://i.dawn.com/large/2016/03/56dc1faf1dbed.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Rama Kunwar, 30, had eloped with her lover eight years ago and returned to her village in western Rajasthan Friday.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'http://www.dawn.com/news/1243924', 'type': 'article', 'title': ""Woman burnt alive in India 'honour killing'"", 'description': 'Rama Kunwar, 30, had eloped with her lover eight years ago and returned to her village in western Rajasthan Friday.', 'image': 'http://i.dawn.com/large/2016/03/56dc1faf1dbed.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'http://www.dawn.com/news/1243924', 'title': ""Woman burnt alive in India 'honour killing'"", 'description': 'Rama Kunwar, 30, had eloped with her lover eight years ago and returned to her village in western Rajasthan Friday.', 'image': 'http://i.dawn.com/large/2016/03/56dc1faf1dbed.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2016-03-06 17:11:38', 'modified_time': '2016-03-06 17:21:03', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/119/afp'}, 'author': 'AFP'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/1445460,11/14/18 5:59,Long wait for body of police officer tortured to death in Afghanistan,"PESHAWAR: Police and civil administration kept waiting at the Pak-Afghan border at Torkham on Tuesday night to receive from Afghanistan the body of a police officer who was kidnapped in Islamabad last month.

SP Tahir Khan Dawar, the head of Peshawar police’s rural circle, was kidnapped from G-10/4 area of the federal capital on Oct 26. On Tuesday, a body said to be of the officer was found in Nangarhar province of Afghanistan.

Officials say the military authorities were in contact with their Afghan counterparts to facilitate the transportation of the body, but it was not likely to reach here on Tuesday. “We may get the body tomorrow,” a senior official said.

The photos of a badly tortured body of the SP and a hand-written Pashto letter, purportedly written by a yet unidentified militant group, went viral before police could officially confirm the happening, but a senior official said a “source” had informed them about the tragic news.

A survivor of two suicide attacks, the victim was kidnapped in Islamabad

On Tuesday, pictures of the body with a letter written in Pashto placed on the chest were shared on social media. After the post started to circulate on social media, KP police refused to confirm it, saying it was not possible for them to verify the reports.

However, a senior government official told Dawn that the police had been informed that the SP’s body was being brought to Khyber district via Torkham border crossing.

The official said that the deputy commissioner of Peshawar and the SSP operations were on their way to Torkham border crossing to receive the body.

A senior KP police official told Dawn that a source alerted them about the discovery of the body inside Nangarhar province of Afghanistan and it was later followed by the appearance of the pictures on social media.

The official said that Islamabad police had shared nothing with KP police about the investigation. He said that KP police and local administration officials were there at the Torkham crossing to coordinate with Afghan authorities to receive the body.

The official said that there was no indication or information about the kidnapping of SP Dawar and that he had been shifted to the other side of the border.

He said that they would investigate where the officer was exactly killed in Afghanistan and which group was responsible for his murder.

The official said that the paper found on the body mentioned no militant outfit and they would also investigate it later.

Meanwhile, Ahmaeduddin, a brother of SP Dawar, told reporters at his residence in the phase-VI area of the Hayatabad that they had yet to receive any official confirmation of his death. A large number of people were turning up to sympathise with the family after the news of his death spread on social media.

The pictures shared on social media showed the body of a man clad in a pair of black trousers and a maroon shirt with a crumpled piece of paper on the chest.

The bloodied face and arms showed that the victim had been tortured to death.

The note written in the Pashto language carries the name of the Wilayat Khorasan, the nomenclature the Islamic State (IS) militant organisation uses to refer to the Pak-Afghan region. It refers to SP Dawar with his first name and said that the “cop who had arrested and killed several militants has met his fate”. The note also warns other people to take caution and threatens that otherwise they would also meet the same fate.

Mr Dawar had travelled to Islamabad from Peshawar on Oct 26 only to disappear on the fateful day. His family told Islamabad police that the officer’s phone went off at around 7:45pm.

Mr Dawar hailed from North Waziristan district and earlier this year was made acting SP and given charge of rural circle. Prior to that he had served as DSP of University Town and Fakirabad and had also had a stint with the Federal Investigation Agency.

SP Dawar had also survived two suicide attacks while he was posted in Bannu district.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1371940,11/21/17 13:31,An unspoken ordeal: Rape and 'forgiveness' in Pakistan's madressahs,"Saima Khan* struggles through tears as she remembers the blood-soaked pants of her 9-year-old son, allegedly raped by a religious cleric. Each time she begins to speak, she stops, swallows hard, wipes her tears and begins again.

The boy fidgets with his scarf and looks over at his mother.

“Did he touch you?” He nods. “Did he hurt you when he touched you?” “Yes,” he whispers.

“Did he rape you?” He buries his face in his scarf and nods yes.

Sexual abuse is a pervasive and longstanding problem at madressahs in Pakistan, an Associated Press investigation has found. But in a culture where clerics are powerful, it is seldom discussed or even acknowledged in public.

It is even more seldom prosecuted, according to the investigation, based on police documents and dozens of interviews with victims, families, officials and aid groups.

Police are often paid off not to pursue justice against clerics, victims' families say. And cases rarely make it past the courts, because the legal system allows the victim's family to “forgive” the offender and accept what is often referred to as diyat (blood money).

A tally of cases reported in newspapers over the past 10 years of sexual abuse by clerics and other religious officials came to 359.

Rana Mohammad Jamal talks about an alleged rape attempt on a girl by a cleric in Kahror Pakka, Lodhran. He said, ""This is a genuine case but the family took money to not speak about it."" His voice and the voices of those who had gathered outside the girl's home grew softer as they spoke about the nearby madressah, which they said was not registered. — AP

That represents “barely the tip of the iceberg,” says Munizae Bano, executive director of Sahil, an organisation that scours the newspapers for such cases.

In 2004, an official disclosed more than 500 complaints of sexual assaults against young boys in madressahs. He has since refused to talk.

Two officials familiar with the madressahs said sexual abuse there happens all the time. They asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution from militant groups. One compared the situation to the abuse of children by priests in the Catholic Church.

“There are thousands of incidences of sexual abuse in the madressahs,” he says. “This thing is very common...I am not sure what it will take to expose the extent of it. It's very dangerous to even try.”

Denial

Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Muhammad Yousaf dismisses the suggestion that sexual abuse is widespread, saying such talk is an attempt to malign the religion, seminaries and clerics.

He acknowledges that it could occur occasionally “because there are criminals everywhere.”

The Interior Ministry, which oversees madressahs, refused repeated written and telephone requests for an interview.

More than 22,000 registered madressahs in Pakistan teach at least 2 million students, often among the country's poorest, who receive food and an education for free.

Thousands more madressahs are unregistered and operate without scrutiny, like the one attended by Saima's son.

When offending clerics pay police off, they refuse to even register a case, according to the victims' families.

The families involved are often poor and powerless.

“We are being pressured to compromise,” says a man from Punjab. His younger brother says he was sexually assaulted at a madressah by a cleric who threatened to kill his family if he told.

Multan Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Police Sultan Azam Temuri denies that pressure from clerics or powerful politicians prompts police to go easy in such cases.

He says cases are investigated when allegations are made. Temuri says his department is trying to tackle child abuse in general with the introduction of gender and child protection services.

Forced forgiveness?

Victims and their families can also choose to “forgive” an assailant because Pakistan's legal system is a mix of British Common Law and Shariah law.

A similar legal provision was changed last year to prevent forgiveness of “honour” killings, where victims are murdered because they are thought to have brought shame on their families. Honour killings now carry a mandatory sentence of life in prison, but clerics in sexual abuse cases can still be forgiven.

Victims and their families often come under intense pressure to “forgive” the crime, or essentially settle for money. Many do, partly because they don't believe they have the power to do anything else.

Sahil offers families legal aid to pursue such cases. Last year, Sahil found 56 cases of sexual assault involving religious clerics. Yet, none of the families accepted Sahil's offer of legal assistance.

The story of Saima's son, who says he was raped by his teacher in Kahror Pakka, Lodhran shows how difficult it is to get justice in cases of sexual abuse at madressahs.

At the courthouse in Kahror Pakka, the former cleric waited his turn to go before a judge. A half dozen members of the militant organisation Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) were there to support the teacher.

They scowled and moved closer when an AP reporter sat next to the teacher, who was shackled to a half dozen other prisoners. The whispers grew louder and more insistent.

“It's too dangerous here,” said one person, looking over at the militants nearby. “Leave. Leave the courthouse, they can do anything here.” The teacher had already confessed, according to police, and the police report said he was found with the boy. Yet, he swore his innocence in court.

“I am married, why would I do this?” he said.

In the end, the mother, Saima, “forgave” the cleric and accepted approximately Rs30,000, according to police. The cleric was set free.

Bilal Colony SHO Fardad Shaikh said that gas was apparently left open in the home in Sector 5-D near Dua Chowk and owing to the leakage, the home was filled with gas. The officer said that the family were asleep at around 2.30am and when the owner woke up in the morning and lit a matchstick for smoking, it triggered an explosion. As a result, the house caught fire.

Seven persons suffered burn injuries and they were taken to a hospital, where one of them, identified as Mazhar Adil, 8, died.

The SHO said that the condition of two or three other persons was also stated to be critical. He said that all the victims belonged to the same family.

The injured were identified as Fasiur Rehman Adil, 7, Syeda Ghazi Adeel, 13, Syed Adil, 35, Nosheen Adil, 30, Saba Ateeq, 25, and Saif Ullah Adil, 12.

The police called the Bomb Disposal Squad to ascertain the nature of the explosion. The bomb experts in their report stated it was an incident caused by gas leakage. The police said that it was regular gas as no evidence of a cylinder explosion was found at the spot.

BDS official Abid Farooq told the media that it appeared that the gas leakage took place at night, with gas filling the house. He said the explosion caused substantive damage to the two-storey building.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1547062,4/7/20 7:02,Nausheen to lead FBR amid big tax revenue shortfall,"ISLAMABAD: Amid massive tax revenue shortfalls during the first nine months of the current fiscal year, the government on Monday appointed Nausheen Amjad chief of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).

At the same time, the cabinet also approved termination of the honorary/pro-bono appointment of Shabbar Zaidi as FBR chairman with immediate effect.

The post fell vacant in February when Mr Zaidi went on an indefinite medical leave only days after resuming office on Jan 21. In his absence, Ms Nausheen, who was posted as FBR administration member, has been looking after the office of chairman as well.

Prime Minister Imran Khan appointed Mr Zaidi as FBR chairman in May 2019 with a vision that he would bring about desired reforms and work towards achieving the revenue collection target of Rs5.5 trillion projected for the current fiscal year.

Eleven months later, the federal cabinet through circulation on Monday approved the summary of a selection committee that unanimously recommended Ms Nausheen, a BS-22 officer of Inland Revenue Services (IRS), for the position of FBR chairperson with an immediate effect.

High-ups in the FBR believe that delay in the filling top positions of member operations in IRS and Customs in the board has caused uncertainty within the tax department, leading to revenue bleeding on a daily basis.

Names of several bureaucrats were in circulation for the FBR chairman appointment including the name of Tariq Mehmood Pasha of IRS, currently serving as Secretary Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan, Director General Customs Intelligence Zahid Khokhar, Member Customs Policy Javed Ghani and Additional Secretary Finance Ahmed Mujtaba Memon.

According to a source, PM Khan himself approved Ms Nausheen’s appointment as the chairperson of the FBR. The delay in the appointment of the chairperson and a special assistant on revenue was blocked by a powerful group close to the prime minister, the source said, adding that the reshuffle in cabinet and other key decisions taken on Monday would also pave the way for the appointment of special assistant on revenue.

Adviser to the PM on Finance and Revenue Dr Hafeez Shaikh also gave his nod for the appointment of a special assistant on revenue to look after the revenue division affairs under his supervision, the source said.

According to the source, the new chairperson has been tasked with the removal of all officers with tainted reputation and to replace them with competent and honest officers. The new chairperson would discuss with the finance adviser the postings and transfers of officials, the source said, adding that the PM was not happy with the news in circulation about alleged corruption within the tax machinery.

Cumulatively, the FBR missed tax revenue targets by a whopping Rs470bn during the nine-month period from July 2019 till March 2020, as the total collections during the period reached Rs3.050 trillion against the revised target of 3.520tr.

Cumulatively, the FBR missed tax revenue targets by a whopping Rs470bn during the nine-month period from July 2019 till March 2020, as the total collections during the period reached Rs3.050 trillion against the revised target of 3.520tr.","['revenue', 'fbr', 'amid', 'zaidi', 'appointment', 'tax', 'big', 'special', 'nausheen', 'source', 'lead', 'shortfall', 'chairperson', 'chairman']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e731bab99.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd329902b790.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e4d6d7c0e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/04/5e8be73af0797.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/04/5e8be73af0797.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/04/5e8be73af0797.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Amjad replaces Shabbar Zaidi officially, had been looking after the office of chairman while the latter was on leave.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1547062', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Nausheen to lead FBR amid big tax revenue shortfall', 'description': 'Amjad replaces Shabbar Zaidi officially, had been looking after the office of chairman while the latter was on leave.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/04/5e8be73af0797.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1547062', 'title': 'Nausheen to lead FBR amid big tax revenue shortfall', 'description': 'Amjad replaces Shabbar Zaidi officially, had been looking after the office of chairman while the latter was on leave.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/04/5e8be73af0797.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-04-07 07:02:19', 'modified_time': '2020-04-07 07:38:46', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/360/mubarak-zeb-khan'}, 'author': 'Mubarak Zeb Khan'})",[],dawn
https://www.dawn.com/news/841598,2/11/09 0:00,Police Order revisited,"POLICE Order 2002 was introduced with much gusto. Its avowed purpose was to reinvent the police so it could prevent and detect crime more efficiently and maintain public order. The central idea was to transform the police department into a professional, service-oriented force that would be accountable to the people.

After six years of half-hearted implementation, the future of Police Order 2002 has become uncertain. Certain circles are arguing that the order should be repealed and the system made to revert to its original status. Interestingly, the move to rescind the law is not supported by insightful debate or deliberation on its efficacy or flaws. Instead, the focus appears to be on backdoor manipulation.

Politics is the root cause behind the move to repeal Police Order 2002 and we would be well advised not to fall for this deliberate diversion. Any decision on retaining or abolishing the Police Order in part or in toto has to be made keeping in view administrative considerations and the usefulness of its provisions. The sensible course would be to identify existing problems and address those issues through legal channels in accordance with the law of the land.

It may be helpful to look at the salient features of Police Order 2002. Under the order, the police establishment was reorganised separating investigation from the operations branch, which may not have been the ideal option. It laid down procedures for the appointment and removal of a provincial police officer on merit and gave him financial powers as an ex officio secretary to the provincial government, enabling him to decide matters expeditiously without stumbling over bureaucratic bottlenecks.

It gave security of tenure to the chiefs of police in districts, capital cities and provinces so they could not be removed arbitrarily. Public safety commissions and police complaints authorities were set up to ensure public participation in policing. It is a pity that these provisions were not implemented in their entirety. However, the district police officer was effectively freed from the general direction and control of the meddlesome district magistrate.

It would be appropriate to objectively evaluate the working of the new police system. To what extent has it achieved its declared objectives and what are the pitfalls in the system? This assessment must be carried out in a fair and impartial manner if the aim is to create a professional police organisation that can successfully meet the challenge of controlling law and order. Changes should not be suggested merely to serve the vested interests of a particular group.

It is argued by proponents of the old system that the force under the new Police Order has become too autonomous and there is no institution to check its unbridled authority. The fact is that the new law puts more stringent checks on the police. They are accountable within their own hierarchy, to the elected nazim, the judiciary, the public safety commissions and the Public Complaints Authority. Furthermore, there are penal provisions for misconduct.

The bureaucracy and the politicians want to assume control of the police. Much of the clamour for rolling back the new police laws is motivated by this consideration. The question we need to ask is this is the driving force a desire to check police excesses and make

the force accountable for its conduct, or do the critics simply want to gain control over the police for ulterior motives?

Under the Police Act 1861, the district superintendent worked under the general direction and control of the district magistrate (DM). The bureaucracy exercised immense influence because of this provision. A district magistrate or his subordinate executive magistrates never succeeded in checking the reprehensible behaviour of the police. On the contrary, they provided legal cover to police excesses. Ordinary people suffered immensely because of this complicity between the local police officer and local executive magistrate.

Subordination of the police to the DM is against the universally accepted principle of separation of powers. Under the previous system, the police, magistracy and prosecution were controlled by a DM. This resulted in lack of transparency and objectivity.When the government of the day wanted to arm-twist a certain political group, the police would round up its members on the DM's orders. The Sub-divisional District Magistrate (SDM), acting on the policy laid down by the DM, would grant physical remand and refuse bail. The prosecutor would push the case in compliance with the directions of the same officer and an amenable magistrate would award punishment. This made for a travesty of justice.

In all fairness it has to be acknowledged that all is not well with the current police system either. The public has not experienced discernible change with the enforcement of Police Order 2002. There has been no decrease in crime and police behaviour has not changed. Still, a failure to deliver the goods does not mean that the new police system was inherently flawed.

The failures we see can be attributed primarily to hasty and incomplete implementation. The system was changed overnight without preparing the ground for a drastic overhaul. It should have been done in phases and supplemented with training and other initiatives. Secondly, not all the provisions were implemented. For instance, the new law gave the provincial and district police chiefs security of tenure. This was never put in place. Citizens' bodies including the public safety commissions were not made functional in most cases. The Public Complaints Authority could never take off.No system is perfect and what we have at present is not without its flaws. Nor was the previous system unblemished. But this does not mean that the solution lies in blindly reverting to the old set-up. Instead of placing the police under the control of the bureaucracy, police reforms should try to make the force accountable to the public, rid it of political interference, introduce meritocracy, modernise policing methods and introduce operational independence.

Provisions of law that have hampered police working, like the watertight compartmentalisation of the operations and investigation branches, need to be done away with to ensure smooth working, coordination and interdependence of the two branches of police.The focus of the reforms should be the police station which is the basic unit of the organisation. The public perception about the police is shaped by the treatment citizens receive at the police-station level. Respect for human rights, crime prevention and detection, overall service delivery and better police-community relations can only be achieved if the police stations are effectively reformed. Bureaucratic control is not likely to achieve this.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1576123/alleged-killer-of-11-family-members-in-pannu-aqil-turns-out-to-be-religious-fanatic,8/24/20 6:30,Alleged killer of 11 family members in Pannu Aqil turns out to be religious fanatic,"SUKKUR: Wahabullah Indher — the man who allegedly slaughtered 11 members of his immediate family within his house in Maulvi Mohammad Saleh Indhar village, located near Pannu Aqil, during the night intervening Aug 18 and 19 — appeared to be a religious fanatic as he confessed to have “offered the sacrifice” to please Almighty Allah.

He kept repeating his statement before police since his arrest, in Adilpur town of Ghotki district, on Aug 19. Currently on a 14-day police remand, Wahabullah was quoted as claiming that he and his adult children had received an edict from Almighty Allah through a “same dream” asking them to offer the sacrifice in order to avert a “disaster looming large on us”.

Brother claims area police conducted four raids on house but could not rescue victims

Indhar had seven sons and four daughters. He said he and his [surviving] sons sacrificed his three younger sons — Mahmood Ahsan, 4, Mahmood Asad, 3, and a newborn — and the daughters — Iqra, 18, Isra, 8, Sobia, 6, and Hajani, 5 — with a dagger (which has been taken into custody the police). The others slain by the suspects were Wahabullah’s wife, Ruqayya, 42, his eldest son Habibullah’s pregnant wife, Naseema, 19/21, and their two children, Nazia, 3, and one-year-old Ali Sher. Habibullah and his three brothers, Hizbullah, Kaleemullah and Majid, are in police custody for their alleged complicity in the gruesome offence. According to Wahabullah, he killed his wife and Naseema and the rest were killed by his three surviving sons. Majid was not accompanying him when the arrests were made. He was taken into custody the next day.

Although Wahabullah appeared happy and satisfied over the horrible act, his estranged brother, Mian Asad, revealed startling facts about the whole episode and accused the area police of not daring to “rescue the victims despite making no less than four attempts”.

Speaking to local reporters, Mian Asad said he was alarmed when came to know that Wahabullah and his sons were on their way to Adilpur [on Aug 19] and alerted the police. He said he knew that they intended to kill a daughter of his [Asad’s] former (divorced) wife. He said his former wife’s family and the area police were timely alerted and the suspects were nabbed.

Mian Asad also revealed that the Cantonment police of Pannu Aqil were approached many days before the incident with plea to rescue the “hostages” who had been confined to the house for one week and nobody was allowed to enter the house. He said Wahabullah had a pistol and he kept threatening the inmates as well as any visitor trying to go inside.

He said the police made four attempts, the last one a day before the incident, during the week but never dared to lay hands on Wahabullah, who every time threatened to shoot anyone trying to enter the house. He wondered why the police could not realise gravity of the situation despite being alerted about the lives of a large number innocent persons being in danger.

According to Mian Asad, Wahabullah’s neighbours stated that the suspects kept reciting some strange rhymes and playing music by beating some mettle pots on the fateful night but all this stopped at around midnight.

Meanwhile, Sukkur DIG Fida Hussain Mastoi told the media on Sunday that a thorough investigation into the incident was under way and the suspects were being interrogated. He said an inquiry into the role of the area police was also being conducted and departmental action would be taken if negligence was proved.

Regarding a post-mortem examination of the victims, Pannu Aqil taluka Hospital medical superintendent Salahuddin Ujjan said there was no evidence suggesting that any of the deceased was drugged before being killed.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1588201,11/2/20 13:17,"Underage marriage: 13-year-old Arzoo recovered after SHC orders, says Wahab","Arzoo, a teenage Christian girl who was allegedly abducted before being forcefully converted and married to a Muslim man, has been recovered, Sindh government spokesperson Murtaza Wahab announced through a tweet on Monday evening.

Speaking to Dawn.com, acting Karachi police chief Additional IG Arif Hanif confirmed that the 13-year-old girl had been recovered safely and her purported husband had also been arrested.

The city police chief said the girl would be sent to a shelter home as per the directions of the Sindh High Court (SHC) while the suspect would be presented before the court on Tuesday.

Earlier in the day, the SHC had ordered the police to recover Arzoo and shift her to a shelter home.

""The judge has ordered the girl be recovered by police and relevant agencies and shifted to a shelter home. Next hearing fixed for Thursday morning [November 5]. My lawyer has informed the court that an intervener will be filed on my behalf,"" Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari said in a tweet.

Activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir — who is part of the legal team fighting the case on behalf of Arzoo's parents — also confirmed the development, adding that the SHC had directed that the girl be produced before the court at the next hearing. Speaking to Dawn.com, he said the court in the meantime has ordered that a medical test be conducted to determine the girl's age.

The court noted that issues to be addressed are the girl's age, whether she was forcibly converted and if her marriage is legal, he said.

""I trust the Sindh government and the police would use all resources at their disposal"" to recover Arzoo, he said.

""To save our children, the government, judiciary, lawyers, civil society and the media should all be on the same page. We all need to play our respective roles effectively,"" he said.

""Glad both the Sindh government and the federal government want to pursue #JusticeForArzoo. There is a lot to learn from the injustices committed in this case first by the accused and then by our governance system. With both governments on board hope this case will become ground for renewed focus on child rights,"" he added.

Sindh government spokesperson Wahab added that the court had issued the directives on an application filed by the provincial government.

Sindh Governor Imran Ismail said Arzoo's case would be solved according to the law. ""There can be no compromise on cases involving underage marriage,"" he said while meeting representatives of minority communities at the Governor House.

The alleged abduction of 13-year-old Arzoo last month had sparked protests from human rights groups against her purported forced conversion and underage marriage with a Muslim man.

According to the first information report of the case registered on his complaint, Arzoo's father Raja stated that on October 13, he and his wife went to work while their son Shahbaz had gone to school. The complainant said his three daughters, including Arzoo, were present at their home in Railway Colony when he received a call from a relative, who told him that Arzoo was missing from the house.

Raja said he reached home and contacted their neighbours, but could not trace his daughter. He subsequently lodged a case regarding the abduction of his daughter against unknown persons at the Frere police station.

Arzoo's family members earlier this month told Dawn that her purported husband Azhar lived in a house opposite theirs along with his family and he was at least 45-years-old. ""The rascal who abducted her has prepared fake papers to show that she is 18-years-old,” her mother said.

Police had booked Syed Ali Azhar, the girl's alleged husband, and arrested his brothers, Syed Shariq Ali, Syed Mohsin Ali, and a friend, Danish, for allegedly abducting the underage girl, purportedly forcibly converting her and marrying her to a Muslim man.

On Saturday, a judicial magistrate had dismissed an application filed by Arzoo's family pleading to send her to a shelter home. Arzoo's father had filed an application under Rule 5 of the Child Marriages Restraint Rules read with Rules 8, 9 and 10 of the Child Marriages Restrain Act, 2013 and Section 100 of the criminal procedure code.

Nasir had argued that girl was 13, therefore, the provisions of the Sindh Child Marriages Restrain Act had also been incorporated in the matter by the investigating agency.

He had argued that the relevant documents concerning the victim's age had already been provided by the complainant to the investigating officer and the same were showing her age as 13 years.

Nasir had contended that further stay of the victim with suspect Azhar would amount to an offence punishable under Section 376 (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 375(v) (rape: with or without her consent when she is under sixteen years of age).

He had said that the complainant was not even asking for the custody of the victim, as he had no objection sending her to a shelter home for DNA testing and other requirements for the investigation.

The investigating officer in the case, Inspector Shariq Ahmed Siddiqui, had stated that the victim had appeared before the SHC and was sent under the protection of the SHO of the Preedy police station in compliance with the court's Oct 27 order.

He said he had called in verification of the victim's B-form, which as per the National Database and Registration Authority, was genuine.","['Dawn.Com', 'Imtiaz Ali', 'Vivek Lahore', 'Peer Baba Khwajaji', 'Iftikhar Husain', 'Surya Kant', 'Nitin Saini', 'M.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1583209,10/4/20 17:22,Nawaz trying to 'blackmail' Pakistan and its institutions to get relief in corruption cases: Shibli,"Information Minister Shibli Faraz on Sunday accused former prime minister Nawaz Sharif of ""blackmailing Pakistan and its institutions"" in order to get relief from the corruption cases against him.

""You (Nawaz) were elected by this country thrice and now you are going against it just because you want relief from your cases? You are blinded, you want to take revenge from the masses. You want to blackmail Pakistan and its institutions. This will not happen,"" Faraz said in a press conference.

The information minister further said that the PML-N supremo had not ""gotten along"" with any of the institutions.

""You want judges like Justice Qayum. You have never gotten along with any army chief, from [retired Gen] Janjua to now. This is what you do: you destablise democracy. You are responsible,"" Faraz declared and went on to say that the former prime minister was a ""product"" who came to power through the support of the establishment. The minister said that the incumbent government had a good relationship with the army because it was ""full of honest people"".

The PML-N leader, Faraz added, was criticising the chairperson of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), who was appointed by Nawaz himself.

""Now you have become a revolutionary, [acting] like you are statesman. You are accused of theft! You were not sent to jail because of any political dispute, [it was because] of the crimes you committed,"" the minister said.

The information minister went on to say that Nawaz ""started a narrative"" that had no connection to his cases. The PTI leader also said that Nawaz's government had devalued the currency so much that, were it not for the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan, the country would have ended up in the same situation like Venezuela ""where people take carts full of money to buy toothpaste"".

The information minister also cast doubt on the unity of the opposition parties that have formed the anti-government alliance named Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM). The alliance includes almost all major opposition parties that seek the government's ouster and has released its plan to launch nationwide protests and rallies. The first public meeting of the PDM will be held in Quetta on October 11.

PML-N is part of the alliance as well and the party's supremo — who is currently in London — virtually addressed the first meeting of the PDM, where he cast doubt over the conduct of the 2018 general elections and workings of the parliament.

""How many parties agree with Nawaz's point of view? They are already divided,"" Faraz said in today's press conference, adding that all politicians in the opposition wanted an NRO but Prime Minister Imran will never agree to give one. The federal minister said that the PTI had come to power with the promise to establish justice in the country and arrest politicians who were involved in corruption.

The minister also blamed previous governments, particularly that of PML-N, for expensive electricity and ruining the economy. He alleged that the Nawaz government had left the economy and the institutions ""hollow"".

'Grand alliance for corruption'

Separately, Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry, in a press conference in Karachi criticised PDM, saying that it had ""no moral and legal justification"" and termed it as the ""grand alliance for corruption"".

He said that PPP supporters were ""disappointed"" that the late Benazir Bhutto's party was working alongside Maulana Fazlur Rehman. He accused PPP of seeking help from ""extremist forces"" to continue its politics.

Chaudhry also expressed suspicions that Rehman was looking to use seminary students to launch protests against the government.

The minister said that the alliance has been speaking against the armed forces and the judiciary and was aiming to spread chaos in the country. At the same time, however, he said that the opposition alliance had ""no future"".","['Dawn.Com', 'Imtiaz Ali', 'M.

https://www.dawn.com/news/684280,12/30/11 16:19,Eighty-one Balochistan honour killing cases in 2011,"QUETTA: A total of 81 cases of honour killings were reported in Balochistan during 2011. It was a marked rise in the reported cases of honour killings in 2011 as only 36 cases of honour killings were reported in 2010 during the same span of time, said the Regional Director Aurat Foundation Haroon Daood while addressing the participants during the launching of pilot study by the Dr Maliha Zia on Honour killings in Pakistan and compliance of law here at local hotel on Friday.

Former Balochistan MPA Dr Shama Ishaq, renowned lawyer Umer Mandokhail, representatives of NGOs, media and members civil society attended the ceremony.

Regional Director Aurat Foundation revealed that as per survey conducted by the Aurat Foundation, women in 90 percent cases of honour killings were not guilty and the cases based on malicious intention.

Out of total 81 people who were killed in the name of honour killing in Balochistan, only 25 were male, he added.

He deplored that honour killing has become an introduction of Balochistan. Word “honour killing” has made the lives of women folk miserable in interior parts of the province where they are being treated as if they were not the human beings, he maintained.

He noted that it was not the tradition and custom of the Baloch but this evil has transferred to Balochistan through the areas borders with the Sindh province.

Expressing his dismay over the sense of pride which prevails among the people after committing this crime, he said that in men-dominated societies man exceeds its limit by violating the rights of women.

Women are deprived of their rights sometimes on the name of religion and sometimes on the name of honour, Haroon added.

Dr Shama Ishaq, former MPA demanded for implementing existing laws to end violence against women. She alleged that presently the law was not implemented in letter and spirit that causing increase in violence against women. She urged upon people from all segment of society to raise voice for the rights of women.

Referring the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2004, she called for effective implementation of the law and stressed that there was need to create awareness among the masses about the law.

Advocate Umer Mandokhail said that after the introduction of Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2004 section 311 has been omitted under which accused involved in honour killings used to get only 14 years of imprisonment.

Under the Amended law 2004 now as per section 302 accused would either get death penalty or life imprisonment in honour killing cases.

Earlier, the speakers defining main findings of the pilot study by the Maliha Zia on honour killings and compliance of law gave suggestions to remove the loopholes and ensure more protection to the women folk.

They suggested that the option of Qisas and Diyat be removed form the Act, standard format for recording data be adopted, and standard format for registration of FIR be decided upon.","['Riffat Rashid', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1409400,5/23/18 6:55,Mother convicted in UK of tricking daughter into forced marriage in Pakistan,"LONDON: A mother was convicted in a British court on Tuesday of deceiving her teenage daughter into travelling to Pakistan to enter into a forced marriage, in the first successful prosecution of its kind.

The woman — who cannot be named without uncovering the identity of her daughter — was found guilty following a trial at Birmingham Crown Court where a jury heard how the girl had sobbed as she was wedded to a male relative 16 years her senior, the same man who had sex with her and left her pregnant on an earlier trip.

The then 13-year-old had to undergo an abortion on returning from Pakistan to Britain, but concerns over the girl’s welfare were allayed by her mother who said the pregnancy was a result of “two teenagers who had sneakily had sex”, prosecutors said.

Jurors heard how as the girl approached her 18th birthday she was tricked by her mother into returning to Pakistan on what she was told would be a family holiday.

The couple were then married in September 2016 despite objections from the girl, before she was returned to Britain with the assistance of the Home Office and her mother was arrested in January 2017.

The mother was convicted on a charge of deceiving the victim into travelling abroad to enter into a false marriage, the first conviction of its kind, as well as for the forced marriage itself and for perjury, after she lied about the incident in the High Court — where she was summoned when concerns were raised by authorities.

As the verdicts were read the defendant appeared shocked and was remanded in custody for sentencing on Wednesday, as her daughter watched from the public gallery.

Judge Patrick Thomas QC told the jury the adjournment was appropriate as the case was “entirely novel”, with no other relevant case law to rely upon.

“Forcing someone into marriage against their wishes is a criminal offence, and a breach of their human rights,” said Elaine Radway of the Crown Prosecution Service.

“It is thanks to the brave testimony of the victim that this serious offending was uncovered and that there was sufficient evidence to secure the conviction today.” The new offence of forced marriage came into effect in June 2014, but prosecutions have been rare.

However the Forced Marriage Unit — a joint Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Home Office team — provided support to about 1,200 potential cases in 2017, a government spokesman said, making Britain a “world leader” in tackling the problem.

https://images.dawn.com/news/1184941,4/2/20 21:00,"Even during a pandemic, female doctors are facing harassment","Doctors across Pakistan and all over the world are on the frontlines during the coronavirus pandemic.

While a lot of them are working tirelessly in hospitals - isolating themselves from their families and risking their own lives - testing and treating patients, many have also volunteered their services to raise awareness and made themselves available to answer any concerns of civilians.

All around social media, folks are sharing their appreciation for medical workers, calling them heroes and warriors. Surely they're getting the respect they deserve, right?

Well, the male doctors are... Can't say the same for women.

Apparently, even a pandemic can't stop predators from harassing women in the medical field who are utilising their time to help those in need. And those doctors have had enough.

Yep, you got that right. Where doctors are talking about saving yourself from a dangerous virus, some men are trolling them with vulgar messages.

Imagine being a doctor and trying your best to help people, being made to waste precious time having to block/report numbers using such abusive language.

For female doctors, this is not a new case though, as Dr. Anza shared with Images.

""It starts right from when you join med school. If you mention it on your social media profile or even hint at it, the messages start pouring.""

""What's weird is how they always start off in an eerily 'respectful' manner, saying 'Hello doctor sahiba' and then it goes off in a bad direction. Sometimes it's from other doctors - or people claiming to be doctors/med students.""

Dr. Fizza* started facing problems after becoming a volunteer.

""I've been relatively under the radar so I hadn't really faced anything like what I had heard from fellow doctors,"" said Fizza.

""When the time came to volunteer, I joined in immediately, genuinely hoping to help as much as I can. But then came the attacks.""

""Sometimes they would start off like a real patient but things would take a shift. And I'd ignore it a lot because I'd think, 'They’re just trolls', but sometimes the messages would be too graphic and come with pictures and videos that would just ruin my day. I knew of such things happening but seeing it for myself was depressing.""

Fizza revealed that she also backed out of volunteering because it was too much to bear.

Aleeza*, the founder of an online telemedicine company, opened up more about the virtual harassment faced by her team. Her company has a team of female doctors who are digitally connected to patients that need healthcare.

""We have an app through which patients can directly connect with female doctors and have a consultation via chat, audio or video call,"" said Aleeza, adding that they face this issue a lot on the app, especially the past few months.

""Last Saturday, we made our app free for the coming three months so that people could use it during this pandemic, to ask about Covid-19 symptoms, screenings etc especially because of the lockdown and the load in hospitals, a person shouldn't have to go in just for a consultation.""

""We made the app free to help people and every now and then, someone calls to say 'I love you' to a doctor who could be helping a person who needs it, saying 'Please talk to me', 'What are you doing', 'Tell me about yourself'. As soon as someone starts doing so, we block them. We've had enough to know how to deal with them now.""

For this app and its doctors, the preparation came from a previous spammer attack. Aleeza revealed that they had been facing issues long before they made their app free. That's right, people paid to troll female doctors who just wanted to do their job.

""Around two months ago, we had a spammer attack where a number of men started calling all our doctors, booking their slots, which the doctor couldn't unbook for another patient and bombarding them with missed calls. The doctors couldn't see any other patients.""

""Then those guys started having inappropriate conversations, sending vulgar pictures and porn site links within the session... Again, this was when the app wasn't even free. They were paying to do all this! I guess we did make good money from it.""

Of course Aleeza and her team took immediate action to figuring it out and reducing the trolling.

""We reported it and added some checks and balance on our app after which it reduced significantly but they're still there.""

Despite all the regulations, some problematic folks still get through, and while it may be a joke for some, the damage is quite deep for the people at this telemedicine company.

""I work with doctors who come back to work,"" explained Aleeza. ""The main purpose of my company is to bring female doctors who've left the field back into the workforce. So many aspiring doctors end up quitting after marriage. It takes a lot for them to convince their family for why they need to come back to work even though this is a manageable way to do so.""

""Some of my doctors actually said they can't do this because when they come back to work and they get this treatment, their family becomes very upset. During the spam attack, a lot of them got disturbed and demotivated.""

She added, ""We do our best to help our doctors but it's sad that we have to mentally prepare them for this. There should be more talk about this because a lot of hospitals are using telemedicine now. A lot of doctors especially female doctors will face this abuse.""

According to Dr Tooba*, another who volunteered to help during the pandemic, calling out their behaviour doesn't work.

""They want a response out of you. Whether it's angry or complicit. They know no matter what they do and no matter how you response, you will bear the brunt of it all. That' the victim-blaming culture.""

Tooba shared that her family got very concerned from the first time it happened.

However, she isn't backing down.

""I'm a vocal person, so the first time a guy started saying gross things, I was angry and was yelling at him. Thankfully, my family is understanding about such situations but they worry about me. I don't blame them, just like I don't blame the women who aren't volunteering anymore. It takes a toll on you.""

Of course there are many like Tooba who are standing strong, getting work done despite all these hurdles. They're calling out the problematic behaviour and moving past it. But should they have to? Not at all.

We've normalised harassment so much that we expect this to happen and as a society, it's a nuisance to hear about such accounts. Too many times we've seen women post about what they face in their daily lives and some respond with ""That's life"" or ""No need to make a hue."" Guess what? When they aren't vocal, you deny it happening or restrict it to singular analogies.

It's about time we address such problems and for the love of humanity - the very humanity these doctors are trying to save - stop harassing women who are just trying to do their job.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1532670/infant-boy-kidnapped-in-park-recovered,2/6/20 7:07,Infant boy kidnapped in park recovered,"KARACHI: The infant kidnapped in Saddar’s Jahangir Park a couple of days ago was recovered after a raid near Kalapul, police said on Wednesday.

They added that one-and-a-half-year-old Sudais along with his parents had come to the park on Feb 2 where he went missing.

Subsequently, the Preedy police registered a kidnap case against an unidentified couple, which was seen in the closed-circuit television camera footage taking the child away from the park.

A special team of the police led by Inspectors Atiq Rehman and Sajjad Khan carried out an intelligence-based operation in Kalapul late on Tuesday night and arrested the couple and recovered the child safely.

The officer added that the police during the raid also recovered another boy from the couple’s house, who was also seen in the CCTV footage.

The IGP Sindh and the city police chief announced reward and appreciation certificates for the police party.

A senior officer said that the held couple identified as Shahid and Rukhsana claimed that they had found the infant boy abandoned in the park and took him along.

But the officer said that they had the CCTV footage, which clearly showed that the couple had abducted the child apparently for some ulterior motives.

The investigators decided to conduct the other recovered boy’s DNA test to ascertain as to whether he had also been kidnapped. Apparently the boy had no resemblance with the couple.

The officer said that the couple might have kidnapped the children for begging or selling purposes.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1288177,10/6/16 18:40,Pakistan passes anti-honour killings and anti-rape bills,"ISLAMABAD: A joint session of the Parliament unanimously approved anti-honour killing and anti-rape bills moved by PPP Senator Farhatullah Babar on Thursday.

The legislation on honour killings will introduce strict punishment for the convicts making it tougher than the ordinary murder cases.

Under the new law relatives of the victim would only be able to pardon the killer if he is sentenced to capital punishment. However, the culprit would still face a mandatory life sentence of twelve-and-a-half years.

Before moving the Anti-Rape Bill, Babar informed the joint session: ""The bill will prove to be effective in curbing rape cases across the country.""

Debating during the session, Law Minister Zaid Hamid revealed that the perpetrator of the crime will also be medically examined after this bill is turned into law.

""The verdicts in the rape cases will have to be given within three months, with the right to appeal in six months,"" he added.

""The police station will be obliged to inform the victims of their legal rights,"" Hamid said, adding, ""We have made it mandatory that the culprit must be imprisoned for 25 years.""

The DNA samples collected shall be at the earliest sent for investigation to a forensic laboratory whereat these shall be properly examined and preserved.

— Text of the bill

He further said that rape of minors, as well as the mentally and physically ill, has also become punishable.

Former PPP senator Sughra Imam, who had initially tabled both bills, said: “No law will eradicate a crime entirely but the law should be a deterrent. Laws are supposed to guide better behaviour, not allow destructive behaviour to continue with impunity.”

Dasti downplays importance of bills

Speaking during the joint session, Jamshed Dasti lamented the introduction of bills saying that the session had been called to discuss the matter of Kashmir but it has been overshadowed.

“Indian forces are standing on the border, hundreds of our soldiers are injured and many have embraced martyrdom. There was no point of bringing up this bill today. We had to send a message to our enemy, but this bill has overshadowed it,” he said.

This Parliament has been subdued by the American NGOs and their Jewish agenda, which is against Pakistan.

He also lamented that “today even 5th graders are aware of sex education”.

If anyone talks about Islam and Quran, people possessing no knowledge of the religion pass decree on it to pander to the international terrorist America.

Nawaz vows to ensure implementation of the legislation

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif vowed to ensure the “implementation of the legislation across the country” as he congratulated the Parliament and entire nation on the passage of a bill providing for strict punishment on honour killing.

“I congratulate the Parliament, the NGOs, civil society, academia, media and all those who worked hard and supported us in the passage of this legislation,” Nawaz said in a statement.

He said that honour killing was one of the most critical problems that Pakistan had been facing and the government was determined to adopt all possible ways to remove this stain from the society.

“We have succeeded in our efforts today; there is no honour in honour killing,” the prime minister remarked.

“We will make it sure to fully enforce this legislation across the country as we did during its passage from the Parliament. Women are the most essential part of our society and I believe in their empowerment, protection and emancipation so that they can equally contribute towards development and prosperity of our country,” he reiterated.

Also read: Loopholes persist in 'honour killing' bill

In July, days after the 'honour' killing of social media celebrity Qandeel Baloch, a committee comprising lawmakers from both the lower and upper houses of parliament unanimously approved two bills aimed at tackling 'honour' killings and boosting rape convictions.

The perpetrators of honour killings – in which the victim, normally a woman, is killed by a relative – often walk free because they can seek forgiveness for the crime from another family member.

Rape conviction rates meanwhile are close to zero per cent, largely due to the law's reliance on circumstantial evidence and a lack of forensic testing.

The law minister had earlier said, ""We have plugged all loopholes in the anti-honour killing legislation.""

In the anti-rape bill, “a provision to conduct DNA tests on both the alleged victim and perpetrator has been added for the first time”, he said. The rape of minors, as well as the mentally and physically ill, would become punishable by death.

A 2005 amendment to the law pertaining to 'honour' killings prevented men who kill female relatives pardoning themselves as an ""heir"" of the victim.

But punishment was left to a judge's discretion when other relatives of the victim forgive the killer – a loophole which critics say is exploited.

Rights groups and politicians have for years called for tougher laws to tackle perpetrators of violence against women in Pakistan and the move follows a slew of high-profile killings in the country.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's ruling PML-N party has a large majority of seats in the lower house and the bills are believed to have enough backing from opposition parties to pass in the senate too.","['Dawn.Com', 'Muhammad Bilal', 'The End Is Near', 'Fehmida Abdul Sattar', 'Agha Ata', 'Muzaffar Ali', 'Duniya Hasan', 'Ahsan Gul', 'Jigar Usa', 'Dr.Shamir Baloch']","ISLAMABAD: A joint session of the Parliament unanimously approved anti-honour killing and anti-rape bills moved by PPP Senator Farhatullah Babar on Thursday.

A 2005 amendment to the law pertaining to 'honour' killings prevented men who kill female relatives pardoning themselves as an ""heir"" of the victim.","['bills', 'parliament', 'passes', 'pakistan', 'antirape', 'antihonour', 'session', 'minister', 'bill', 'rape', 'killings', 'honour', 'killing', 'law']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/07/578f783b94d28.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2016/07/5791ba81c1da9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2016/07/578f783b94d28.jpg?r=1902704095', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/03/56d632048d24e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/10/57f66e8e61b71.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/07/5791ba81c1da9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2016/10/57f4d27478e72.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2016/03/56d632048d24e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd306ee076b9.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2016/10/57f4d27478e72.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Legislation on honour killings will introduce strict punishment for convicts making it tougher than ordinary murders.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'http://www.dawn.com/news/1288177', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Pakistan passes anti-honour killings and anti-rape bills', 'description': 'Legislation on honour killings will introduce strict punishment for convicts making it tougher than ordinary murders.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2016/10/57f4d27478e72.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'http://www.dawn.com/news/1288177', 'title': 'Pakistan passes anti-honour killings and anti-rape bills', 'description': 'Legislation on honour killings will introduce strict punishment for convicts making it tougher than ordinary murders.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2016/10/57f4d27478e72.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2016-10-06 18:40:46', 'modified_time': '2016-10-07 12:16:56', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/4131/muhammad-bilal'}, 'author': 'Dawn.com | Muhammad Bilal'})",[],dawn

ISLAMABAD: ‘Harrassment and threats only strengthened the resolve of women journalists to put truth out there.’

This was the message audience took away from the documentary A Dark Place, screened at Pakistan National Council of Arts (PNCA) on Sunday night.

The film gives a voice to female journalists who have been victims of cyber violence and pays tribute to their resistance. The documentary was the first of such screenings of the annual Human Rights Reel Film Festival hosted by the European Union.

Other partners included the United Nations, 16 EU and UN member states, as well as educational and cultural institutions across Pakistan.

The 10-day Human Rights Reel Film Festival marks 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence. The annual international campaign will close on the Human Rights Day on Dec 10, marking the 71st anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Documentary screened at PNCA gives a voice to journalists who have been victims of online violence

A Dark Place showcased interviews of women journalists across several countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Finland, Turkey and Russia, to mention some. Women journalists in these countries complained about being harassed online with rape and death threats. Despite the humiliation and distress, these women were determined that no amount of harassment would limit their freedom of expression.

“I could relate to every incident and case that these women journalists, in the film shown, faced,” anchorperson Asma Shirazi told audience during the panel discussion that followed on ‘Making the Internet a Safe Place for Journalists’.

“I will not portray myself as a victim. They treat women as weak, emotional, sensitive and fragile, but we are stronger than men, taller and stronger than ever,” she said.

Parliamentary Secretary for Law and Justice Maleeka Ali Bokhari, condemned the harassment of women journalists online.

“When we undermine rights of female journalists to speak freely, then we are eliminating half our country,” she said.

Digital rights activist and human rights lawyer Nighat Dad called for improved implementation of harassment safeguards in the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016.

The film festival is a presentation of 29 award-winning films and documentaries from around the world on human rights issues such as freedom of expression, gender equality, access to justice, minority rights and the death penalty.

The programme showcases diversity of cultures across, films from many different countries, in a variety of languages, yet all distinctly about human rights.

The festival is introducing films for schoolchildren through a new partnership with ‘Girl Rising’ which intends to move beyond university students.

The festival this year will also include a workshop for Pakistani filmmakers to discuss opportunities and challenges faced by the film industry.

Subsequent screenings will be held in 10 cities of Pakistan, including Faisalabad, Gujrat, Islamabad, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, Karachi, Peshawar, Mardan and Quetta at various universities, embassies, Centaurus Cineplex, as well as cultural centres such as Goethe-Institute, and PNCA.

EU Ambassador to Pakistan Androulla Kaminara said that building on past experience, the fifth anniversary of the human rights festival sought to highlight the importance of multilateralism, the universality of human rights and the importance of global cooperation to ensure that protection of human rights and respect for human dignity was a reality for all people everywhere.

“The festival also aims to create cross-cultural understanding and stimulate discussions on global human rights issues with students,” she added.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1541742,3/18/20 6:59,Rampant child abuse,"EACH year, the child protection advocacy group Sahil announces its findings on the scale of the abuse that children endure in this country; the data is collected by looking into newspaper reports on the sexual abuse of children (including rape and attempted rape), child marriage, and abducted and missing children. In its most recent statement, foraging through 84 newspapers, Sahil noted that a disturbing 2,846 cases were reported across the country in the previous year. In other words, approximately eight children were subjected to abuse each day of 2019, with more than half being girls (54pc). Prior to that, the figure was even higher at a staggering 3,832 in 2018 — the same year the body of young Zainab Ansari was found in a garbage heap in Kasur; she had been brutally raped and murdered by her captor. The incident sparked protests and demands for accountability across the country. To some degree, it also changed the way we think about the issue of sexual abuse of children, and finally led to the passage of the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Bill by the National Assembly and the Senate in recent weeks. While these figures may send a chill down the spine, they are likely only scratching the surface, as many other cases go unreported. It is only in recent years that a culture of talking about sexual abuse and exploitation has been encouraged in Pakistan, and that too only in certain sections of society. Many other stories will never see the light of day. It may even shock the more naive and insulated amongst us to learn about the exact scale of the problem, or about the capacity for evil in ‘ordinary’ people.

Children are one of the most vulnerable groups in any society, lacking the vocabulary, clear understanding, and often the support they need to confront their abusers. From a young age, they are taught not to question authority — the adults in their midst — and often suffer alone, suppressing whatever horrors they are made to endure in silence. Many abusers are from within the family, or close to the family members, earning and abusing their trust. In Sahil’s most recent data, the majority of children that were subjected to abuse were between the ages of six and 15, but there were some even under the age of one. Let the horror of that figure sink in.

https://www.dawn.com/news/882862/high-achiever-the-wonder-boy,7/18/10 0:00,High achiever: The wonder boy,"Zeerak Ahmed has a multifaceted personality—sparkling brilliant like a diamond. Having earned 12 As in his GCE O-Levels in 2007 and six As in his A-Levels in 2009, and having scored 2160 in the SAT reasoning test and 2280 in the SAT subjects test, Ahmed is now pursuing a major in Computer Science at Princeton University.

He acquired world distinctions in A-Level Thinking Skills and AICT (highest and third highest, respectively). He was the lead actor in Instruments of Faith at his university and in The dreams of Tipu Sultan. He was trained by Reuters, was webmaster for the Global Youth Reporters Programme at Global Environmental Youth Convention held in Dubai in 2006, and won second position at the Ideas Extreme Competition at SOFTEC 2005 organised by NUCESFAST. He is a talented graphic and web designer and maintains his own zeerak.net/blog. Here's an interview with this high achiever.

What was your first big success?

I was chosen Head Boy in my high school. I don't think that was great. It just happened. At the end of the year, everybody who worked with me was happy with the way things had gone. There was a genuine feeling of mutual respect, honour and friendship. That, I think, is my most important achievement.

Who supported you most in your life?

My family. My parents are both great people, and most of my ambition comes from their belief in my abilities. My sister was the achiever of the family, still is, and I think I've only followed in her footsteps. My grandparents, who learnt the importance of education through a lack of it, taught us that learning is the most important thing in life.

I've also been lucky to have the support of my close friends, most of whom are really talented and motivated.

What challenges have you faced in your life?



Different times have had different challenges. Sometimes the worst failure is to be unable to rise to the challenge, and the greatest success is being able to rise to the occasion.

How did you meet your goals over the years?



The more you go back in my life, the more concrete you would see my goals becoming. An 'I don't know' or 'Let's see where it goes' approach to life is something that many good students end up with in college. Many see this as a sign of snobbery, but fail to realise that most often such an attitude is backed up by a struggle for excellence.

Circumstances have taught me that having very specific goals in life, such as being the CEO of a huge technology company, is less important than making sure that you, and those close to you, are happy. Achieving excellence has always been a priority, and I hope it shall always remain one.

What are your most important priorities?



I want to become an accomplished person. I take pride in having met different kinds of people and having empathised with a variety of situations. I want to keep doing that. Education, meeting different sorts of people, and travel are the obvious means to achieve this. But it is possible to engage with people in various activities, and crowd-based activities such as music and sport have this great quality of bringing people together.

What are your short-term and long-term goals?



It would be safe to say I'm not sure. I have sorted a few things out, but I might think differently in 20 years. Who knows?

I'm going to be involved with some sort of design or creative work, perhaps with technology or the media and do some writing alongside. These things have been my passions.

Ten years from now I may be in graduate school. If that does not happen, I'm likely to become a floater, looking for interesting projects that achieve some sort of purpose. Im trying to do the same thing today and am working with a great bunch of people at TEDex Lahore, under independent licence from TED. We organised Pakistans first TEDex event last year and are doing it again this year.

What is success to you?

Success is wholehearted appreciation. To me, it is the respect gained from others while holding on to my principles.

What is your current project?



My current project is a blog that I write, which is about Pakistani culture in the war. Princeton's Music Department sponsored it, and the point is to find voices in modern Pakistan. I chose music, written and visual art as they were my interests, but I'm following teachers, newspapers, anything that will raise awareness and help get people's voices across.

The body of the boy was found from the building of a coaching centre near National Stadium, New Town police officials said.

The corpse was shifted to Civil Hospital Karachi for post-mortem examination. “The boy was strangulated to death before being subjected to sodomy,” said police surgeon Dr Qarar Ahmed Abbas.

A New Town police officer said the victim’s father Abdul Sattar Shah is a watchman at the same coaching centre and resides in the servant quarter of the centre.

The father informed the police that the boy had been missing since 12:30 in the noon.

Police are currently investigating the matter, after which a case will be registered.

Since the beginning of 2018, there has been a marked upsurge in the reporting of sexual abuse cases across Pakistan. The brutal rape and murder of Zainab Ansari in Kasur earlier this month, in particular, shocked the entire country, with #JusticeforZainab becoming the rallying cry in a nationwide drive to end violence against children.

A 15-year-old boy was kept in illegal confinement and sexually assaulted over the course of four days by four men in Rawalpindi's Razzaq Town in January. Similarly, two men reportedly belonging to an influential family allegedly sexually assaulted a teenage boy after intoxicating him in Punjab's Sargodha district during the same month.

Moreover, in the first week of the last month, an eight-year-old boy was allegedly sexually assaulted and strangled in Sherakot. The minor was found dead in an under-construction quarter, half a kilometre from his Yusuf Nagar house. A local had spotted his body which was covered with a piece of cloth.","['Imtiaz Ali', 'Sohail A.', 'Gul Hasan', 'Aslam Qadri', 'Nadeem Khan', 'Images Staff', 'Khurram Husain', 'F.S.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1365141,10/21/17 6:57,Saeed denies harassment allegations as Pakistan squad leaves for Brunei,"LAHORE: Pakistan women’s hockey team head coach Saeed Khan on Friday denied allegations of sexual harassment levelled at him by a player hours before the squad left for Brunei to participate in a three-nation Asia Challenges Cup.

On Thursday, training camp probable Syeda Sadia accused Saeed of harassing her.

Iqra Javed, a player selected for the Brunei-bound squad, came forward in Sadia’s support but she has been dropped on charges of indiscipline.

More surprisingly Nageen Babar, ori­ginally travelling with the team as an umpire, has been selected in Iqra’s place. Sadia has also made a complaint to Punjab sports minister, who has constituted a two-member committee which would start the inquiry after the national team returns.

Yet, Saeed was defiant on Friday.

“I’m not guilty at all and am ready to face any inquiry,” he said. “If I was guilty, I would’ve escaped from the camp but I’m here answering your [reporters’] questions.”

The secretary of Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) women’s wing Tanzeela Aamir, meanwhile, blamed former coach Mohammad Usman for causing this controversy and called for a life ban on him.

The tournament in Brunei, which runs from Oct 22 to 25, was reduced to just three teams after Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Uzbekistan and China pulled out, prompting concerns that the Asian Hockey Federation may cancel it.

Interestingly, while Hong Kong and Brunei will play two matches against each other, while Pakistan will face both teams just once.
