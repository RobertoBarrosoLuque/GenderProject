Giving the details of the incident, District Police Officer Najmul Hasnain said a man, Saqib, a resident of Aleesha area in Akbarpura town of the Nowshera district, was murdered on April 11, this year.

Three persons -Tehsinullah, Abdullah and Fazal Taj, sons of Faridullah, stated to be brothers of woman constable Safia Naz were accused of the murder and nominated in the case. The DPO said all the three accused were declared absconders and police in Akbarpura had later sealed their house as per the law. The lady constable Safia Naz and her sister Neelam, the wife of Liaqat, had moved the Peshawar High Court against the action. The court had allowed both the women to collect the belongings from the house.

It was learnt that lady constable Safia Naz and her sister Neelam reached the family's sealed house on Thursday in Mohallah Malkaan along with a truck to collect the belongings. The two women were accompanied by Station House Officer of Akbarpura Police Station, Abdul Baseer Khan, ASIs Safiullah Khan, Lateef Khan and 10 other cops. It was learned that the women members of the late Saqib, who had been killed allegedly by the brothers of the lady constable, reportedly attacked Safia Naz and her sister Neelam and thrashed them. Later the male family members of the attackers joined the fight and allegedly opened fire that left lady constable Safia Naz dead and her sister Neelam seriously injured. The woman cop was killed and her sister injured by the rivals as 13 police officials stood around unmoved. The assailants fled the scene after committing the crime as the police officials stood nearby. The injured woman, Neelam, was shifted to the Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar in a serious condition.

Registering the first information report with the police, Neelam, nominated Arshad, Nazeer Muhammad, sons of Fazal Muhammad, Naseem, son of Naseer, Asad, son of Bashir, Munsaf, son of Nazeer, for the firing and killing her sister and leaving her injured. The DPO said the SHO, two ASIs and other 10 other cops acted cowardly during the crime. He said all the 13 cops had been suspended and a case registered against them under the Police Act. DSP Tayyab Jan, however, said a case was registered against the cops, excluding the SHO. He said 11 cops had been put in quarter guards.",['Mushtaq Paracha'],"Three persons -Tehsinullah, Abdullah and Fazal Taj, sons of Faridullah, stated to be brothers of woman constable Safia Naz were accused of the murder and nominated in the case.

Lahore Police have yet to ascertain as to who reached the incident site initially as there are many stories doing rounds about it. The Dolphin Force cops claimed that they were the first to approach the woman.

Police have also recovered some of the valuables of the victim. The victim woman’s gold ring were found in the fields where she was reportedly taken by two unidentified men along with her children at gunpoint and was raped. The attackers had taken Rs100,000 cash and other valuables of the victim with them while fleeing.

The commander of Punjab Police finally woke up for the security of Lahore-Sialkot Motorway on Friday. Despite passage of three days, the police failed to arrest the robbers, who had raped and looted the woman on the Motorway. A special investigation team (SIT) visited the crime scene on Friday and restructured the heinous act. However, the investigators could not find any tangible clue to the culprits.

The criminal profiling of 15 suspects had been completed. Traditional and modern techniques of investigation were being used to find out the culprits. A member of the investigation team told The News that DNA [deoxyribo-nucleic acid] samples of suspects are being sent to the Forensic Science Agency. The reports will take some time for matching with the victim.

Meanwhile, Inspector General of Police (IGP) Punjab Inam Ghani said that teams of Punjab Highway Patrol (PHP) and Special Protection Unit (SPU) had been deployed for security duties on the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway. He said the PHP and SPU teams would patrol 24 hours a day in three shifts, which would ensure safety of lives and property of citizens and help curb criminal acts. The IGP termed the news fake regarding the arrest of the main culprit. A private news channel had flashed the news late on Friday night that the main suspect had been arrested. The news also went viral on the social media. However, the IGP Punjab and Shahbaz Gill said there was no such development. They said once the suspect would be arrested, he would be brought before the public.

The IGP directed Additional IGP PHP Captain (retd) Zafar Iqbal Awan to conduct field visits to inspect and monitor the security arrangements of the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway to improve security arrangements under a comprehensive strategy. He expressed these views while instructing officers and talking to the media during his visit to crime scene and launching patrolling of the PHP and SPU teams for security on the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway on Friday.

Additional IGP PHP Captain (retd) Zafar Iqbal Awan, Additional IG Internal Accountability Branch (IAB) Azhar Hameed Khokhar, DIG Special Protection Unit Bilal Siddique Kamiana and other officers were present in the meeting.

The IGP Punjab said that on deputation from Punjab Police for security of Lahore-Sialkot Motorway, 100 personnel would be deployed to the Motorway Police while joint teams of SPU and PHP would be on patrol and security duties in three shifts and these measures were aimed at protecting the passengers travelling by the motorway.

During the conference, IG Motorway Dr Kaleem Imam said the Lahore Police personnel on deputation would be trained by Motorway Police teams. He said that Motorway Police vehicles would also assist in performing their duties on Lahore-Sialkot Motorway and initially Motorway Police vehicles would be on duty to prevent traffic irregularities.

The delegation consisted of Shaista Pervez Malik, Hina Pervez Butt, Ayesha Raza Farooq, Kiran Daar, Kanwal Liaquat, Sania Ashiq and former MNA Saira Afzal Tarar. They apprised the IG Punjab of their concerns over the Gujjarpura incident and said that measures should be taken for protection of women and children in society. The IGP told the delegation about the progress made in the incident and said that police teams had been mobilised day and night to arrest the sexual predators involved in the rape case. “I am personally monitoring the progress from time to time.”

The authorities have short-listed over 70 people with criminal record and their location at the time of the incident was also being monitored. Detectives have also been hired for the inspection of footprints collected from the crime scene.

In a statement, IGP Inam Ghani told that traditional and advance techniques are being used to investigate the case. Suspicious points have been mark around five kilometres from the incident site, he said.

The committee met here under the chairmanship of Senator Faisal Javed at the Parliament House. The forum strongly condemned the rape incident. Senator Faisal Javed said that such incidents could not be curbed unless the punishments were tightened.

“It is unfortunate that the Zainab Alert Bill, which has been passed for several months, could not be implemented,” he noted. The committee directed the TV channels and newspapers to take care of privacy of the rape victim and her family. The chairman of the committee said that the name of the woman or her family should not be published in the media under any circumstances.

Senator Faisal insisted that the public and private media should run a full awareness campaign on such incidents and especially on incidents of child abuse and punish the people. He said that it was better to review the existing laws and amend them to tighten the sentences.

He said Constitution of Pakistan is devised in accordance with the teachings of Quran-o-Sunnah; therefore all the courts of the country should announce sentence to culprits proven guilty in rape cases keeping reports of DNA test as witness.

In accordance with the teachings of Quran-o-Sunnah, there are explicit commands to ensure punishment for culprits of rape to be lashed in public. The courts should acknowledge DNA test report as witness and ensure speedy trial of rape cases and for appeal of these cases, judges of High Court and Supreme Court should be assigned who must be authorised to announce verdict in 24 hours.

The culprits of rape and abuse should be punished at the very place, where they had committed the crime.

LONDON: World leaders participated Sunday in a virtual event held in the remembrance of the victims of the Srebrenica Massacre in which over 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed by the Bosnian Serb army in the biggest genocide on European soil since the World War II.

The United Kingdom's Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Prince Charles, Bosnia-Herzegovina President Šefik Džaferović, Grand Mufti Husein Kavazovic, Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer, Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, Westminster Archbishop Cardinal Vincent Nichols, former UK PM David Cameron, former US president Bill Clinton, Lord William Hague MP, and former US secretary of state Madeline Albright participated in the event.

Speaking at the event held in the remembrance of the biggest act of genocide after World War II, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""There are those who would prefer to forget or deny the enormity of what took place. We must not allow that to happen. We owe it to the victims and to future generations to remember Srebrenica and ensure it never happens again”.

""Over 8,000, mainly Muslim men and boys were killed in a genocide at Srebrenica and more than 20,000 women and children were forcibly deported.

""I want to join you in the mourning of the victims of those terrible events and to stand with their families in their fight for justice,"" Johnson added.

Džaferović, who shared his grief over what transpired 25 years ago, said: ""This commemoration provides us with the opportunity to together pay tribute to those who were brutally killed as well as those who have survived and endured the horrors that no should go through.

""This moment strongly reminds us that we must reaffirm our determination and ensure that the hatred and prejudice that led to the genocide and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia does not spread in our own communities,"" he added.

Prince Charles, who had previously scheduled a trip to Srebrenica in March that got postponed in March due to COVID-19, said: ""The terrible events of July 1995, confirmed as genocide by international courts, are a dreadful stain on our collective conscience.

""By remembering the pain of the past, and learning its lessons, we can together resolve that it must never happen again.

""This is why the work of organisations like the UK’s 'Remembering Srebrenica' is so vitally important; and why, 25 years after these terrible crimes were committed, we should stand in determined solidarity with those who have lost so much.”

The UK is the largest commemorator of the Srebrenica genocide in the world holding around 1,000 local memorial activities annually and educating approximately 100,000 young pupils on the lessons to be learnt from Srebrenica.

Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie — who is also known for her work as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) — said: ""I'm thinking today of the mothers of Srebenica and all of the other survivors whose husbands, brothers, and sons were murdered in the genocide 25 years ago.

""It is a loss beyond words. To the people of Bosnia, I send you my sympathy, my respect, and I grieve with you,"" the starlet added.

Former US president Bill Clinton also addressed the remembrance event held to honour the victims of the Bosnian genocide. ""The tragic events in Srebrenica awoke the world to the horrors of the conflict and triggered the efforts that ended the war,"" he said.

""Today, we must remember — as we did when I had the honor to be in Srebrenica in ‘15 — so we never make those mistakes again.

""It has been profoundly moving for me at every time, at every opportunity to continue to add my voice across the world in the grief of the families of those who were killed,"" he added.

Speaking of the genocide, Starmer said: ""As we mark Srebrenica memorial day, it seems incomprehensible that just, 25 years ago, such inhumane genocide took place on our continent.

""Described by the United Nations as the worst crime on European soil since the World War II, the killings at Srebrenica took the lives of over 8000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys who must never be forgotten.""

Cameron also addressed the event, saying: ""With many anniversaries, the thing we tend to remark on how long ago something actually happened but when we commemorate Srebrenica, it's how recent it was that continues to shock.

""Just 25 years ago, the end of the 20th century, an unimaginable crime took place, thousands of men and boys were separated from their families, they were murdered and the world watched on.""

The UK’s national ceremony on Saturday — July 11 — was the culmination of a week that saw over 1,000 memorial activities across the country to honour over 8,000 Muslim men and boys who were killed in the space of just a few days in Srebrenica in July 1995.

A variety of events and activities have been organised by local councils, community centres, police stations, places of worship, and schools to name but a few to remember those who were brutally murdered in the genocide which the UN called ""the worst atrocity on European soil since the Second World War"".

Remembering Srebrenica UK Chairperson Dr Waqar Azmi OBE said: ""We are proud that our country commemorates Srebrenica Memorial Day with support at the highest levels from HRH Prince Charles and Prime Minister Boris Johnson bringing our nation together in acts of remembrance.

""These acts of remembrance bring ordinary Britons together to remember the past and encourage to help build stronger, more inclusive communities free from prejudice and intolerance and inspire the next generation to help ensure that hatred does not prevail.”



",[],"Over 8,000, mainly Muslim men and boys were killed in a genocide at Srebrenica and more than 20,000 women and children were forcibly deported.
We owe it to the victims and to future generations to remember Srebrenica and ensure it never happens again”.
""Over 8,000, mainly Muslim men and boys were killed in a genocide at Srebrenica and more than 20,000 women and children were forcibly deported.
""The tragic events in Srebrenica awoke the world to the horrors of the conflict and triggered the efforts that ended the war,"" he said.
Speaking of the genocide, Starmer said: ""As we mark Srebrenica memorial day, it seems incomprehensible that just, 25 years ago, such inhumane genocide took place on our continent.","['leaders',

1335,348,532,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/717423-police-constable-tanoli-s-martyrdom-may-be-a-sign-of-ttp-s-return,,Police constable Tanoli’s martyrdom may be a sign of TTP’s return,"Police constable Arif Khan Tanoli, who was murdered in Korangi on Friday, was laid to rest on Saturday. And with his martyrdom, Karachi may have witnessed the return of a banned terrorist group, namely the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).

The first five years of the Karachi operation were relatively peaceful, as they saw the numbers of bomb blasts, target killings, kidnappings for ransom and other serious crimes drop.

However, the operation failed to put a permanent stop to terrorism in the city, as is evident from the situation in the past couple of years that have witnessed its gradual rise.

Several major and minor incidents of terrorism have been carried out in the city in these last couple of years, including the attacks on the Chinese consulate and the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) as well as several bomb attacks.

This year alone the city has witnessed the PSX attack, seven hand grenade attacks on the Rangers, the police and the Jamaat-e-Islami’s Kashmir rally, and murders of five police officials.

The investigators of these terrorist acts had been sure about the involvement of Sindhi and Baloch nationalist parties in the Chinese consulate, PSX and grenade attacks, but they had been not too sure about the group behind the murders of police officials.

However, the TTP claiming responsibility for murdering constable Tanoli has led the officials to believe that the terrorist group may have been behind the series of attacks on policemen in Karachi.

“The statement released by the TTP claiming responsibility for murdering the policeman in Karachi seems authentic,” senior counterterrorism expert Raja Umer Khattab told The News. “It’s an alarming situation if the TTP exists in the city and its sleeper cells are operating and attacking police officials.

The officer said that this may be only the beginning for the TTP, as they may already be planning major terrorism activities. He added that the only solution is to intensify action against terrorists before they get opportunities to strengthen.

PC Tanoli

Tanoli was the fifth policeman to have been murdered in a targeted attack in the city in recent months. Posted at Madadgar 15, he was shot and injured by two men near Mehran Town.

His assailants had targeted him while he was on his way to work. He was being taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre when he succumbed to his injuries.

The Counter Terrorism Department’s Civil Lines police station registered FIR No. 134/20 under Section 302/34 of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act against two hitherto unidentified motorcyclists.

‘Familiar ground’

This is the first time the TTP has claimed responsibility for a crime in Karachi since the Karachi operation began on September 5, 2013, especially in recent months.

Though five policemen have been murdered in the city in recent months, this is the first time a terrorist group has claimed responsibility for such a crime in the city.

Khattab said the TTP claiming responsibility for the latest murder confirms their involvement. “The area where this constable was martyred had once been dominated by the terrorist group.” Investigators believe a group of trained target killers is operating in the city. “One or two sleeper cells may be operating in the city to target cops,” said Khattab.

“There are several similarities in these cases: the assailants target their victims after conducting proper recce, they shoot them in the head and they escape with their weapons.”

This sleeper cell seems similar to those gangs that were busted for their involvement in the murder of traffic police constable Khan Muhammad on Abul Hassan Ispahani Road in July 2017 and the murders of three policemen in Korangi, said the officer.

Funeral prayers

The funeral prayers of constable Tanoli were offered at the Special Security Unit (SSU) headquarters. A police contingent presented the guard of honour to the martyred policeman on the occasion. Tanoli had joined the police department in April 2017 as a constable. He is survived by a wife and a daughter.

His funeral prayers were attended by Sindh police chief Mushtaq Mahar, Karachi police chief Ghulam Nabi Memon, Security & Emergency Services Division DIG Maqsood Ahmed, the zonal DIGs and SSPs, SSU Commandant Irfan Mukhtar Bhutto, Madadgar 15 SP Abdullah Memon and other senior officers.

On the occasion, DIG Ahmed ordered support for the family of the martyred police constable, saying that all the necessary legal formalities should be completed as soon as possible for the family to receive compensation for their loss.",['Faraz Khan'],"Police constable Arif Khan Tanoli, who was murdered in Korangi on Friday, was laid to rest on Saturday.

Vulnerable populations experience the COVID-19 outbreak differently as it is likely to reinforce their marginalized position in society.

Concerns to this effect were expressed at the first of a series of webinars on ‘Gender and Shadow Pandemic’ here Friday. An initiative of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), in collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and UN Women, the webinar was part of a Virtual Advocacy Campaign (VAC) on COVID-19 mitigation measures. With the discussions revolving around ‘Reporting and Underreporting of Sexual and Gender Based Violence: Gender Responsive Policing,’ the webinar was supported by stakeholders of criminal justice institutions and the provincial Police Departments.

Inaugurating the webinar, UNODC Country Representative Jeremy Milsom emphasized on the ominous nature of the ‘shadow pandemic’ that intensifies gender-based violence and said “UNODC is committed to support, strengthen and implement gender-responsive policing reforms to address the magnified nature of Gender-Based Violence in Pakistan.”

UNFPA Country Representative Lina Mousa, remarked “Pre-existing vulnerabilities that subject women and girls to sexual and gender-based violence is further exacerbated during a pandemic. In this regard, UNFPA has been actively supporting the government departments and the NDMA, with a specific focus on vulnerable segments of the society such as women, children, and people living with disabilities.”

Country Representative a.i., UN Women Pakistan, Aisha Mukhtar highlighted, “Vulnerable populations experience the COVID-19 outbreak differently, which is likely to reinforce their marginalized position in society. Their experience of discrimination, violence, and stigma further limits their access to essential support and services and increases their risk of experiencing violence. Our collective efforts will ensure that no-one is left behind in the response to COVID-19.”

The webinar brought together a diverse mix of speakers and stakeholders including legal policy, human rights, gender and empowerment experts. Barrister Benazir Jatoi and gender expert Nazish Brohi highlighted trends in reporting of GBV crimes influenced by societal power structures, traditional mindsets and challenges of pre-trial reporting on violence against women to seek justice from the criminal justice institutions.

Senior leadership from provincial police departments included Additional Inspector General of Police-Sindh Abdul Khalique Shaikh; Deputy Inspector General of Police Muhammad Ali Babakhel; Deputy Inspector General of Police-Punjab Tariq Abbas Qureshi; and Deputy Inspector General of Police-Balochistan Dr. Farhan Zahid.

Taking stock of issues surrounding gender-responsive policing, it was mutually agreed that partnerships with civil society, evidence-based initiatives informed by the relevant data, institutional reforms, awareness-raising, and sensitization, targeting the public, particularly women, educating them on their rights as well as capacity building of the police as front-line responders, including induction of women police at all levels will act as a force multiplier to tackle the unprecedented nature of the pandemic.

Criminal Justice Advisor Jouhaida Hanano extended a note of thanks on the conclusion of the webinar, reinforcing the commitment of the organizers towards supporting stakeholders to minimize the GBV risks of the shadow pandemic.",['Our Correspondent'],"Islamabad : Pre-existing vulnerabilities that subject women and girls to sexual and gender-based violence are further exacerbated during a pandemic.

Eight states have used COVID-19 emergency orders -- which suspend medical procedures not deemed immediately necessary -- to limit access to pregnancy terminations, said the UN Working Group on Discrimination against Women and Girls.

The group singled out Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. ""We regret that the above-mentioned states, with a long history of restrictive practices against abortion, appear to be manipulating the crisis to severely restrict women´s reproductive rights,"" said the group´s vice-chair Elizabeth Broderick. The independent experts do not speak for the UN but report their findings to the world body.

""For many women in the US, bans on abortion during this pandemic will delay abortion care beyond the legal time limit or render abortion services completely inaccessible,"" said Broderick.

Those who do seek termination services will be forced to travel out of state, thereby risking their own health and disregarding public health guidelines, the experts said. ""Abortion care constitutes essential health care and must remain available during the COVID-19 crisis,"" Broderick added.

""Restrictions on access to comprehensive reproductive health information and services, including abortion as well as contraception, constitute human rights violations and can cause irreversible harm."" The group said it was ""inherently discriminatory"" to women to deny them access to services only they require.

It said the move prevented women from exercising control over their own bodies and lives. Whilst the United States backed the COVID-19 response resolution at the World Health Organization´s annual assembly last week, it disassociated itself from paragraphs referring to ""sexual and reproductive health"" or language suggesting that abortion is included in the provision of health services.

""The United States believes in legal protections for the unborn,"" the US mission in Geneva said. The working group said that access to safe and legal abortion was ""essential and must remain a key component of the UN's priorities in its responses to the COVID-19 pandemic"".

Broderick said the situation was ""the latest example illustrating a pattern of restrictions and retrogressions in access to legal abortion care"" across the United States.

The five-member working group was established by the UN Human Rights Council in 2010. Their statement was also endorsed by two further UN experts: the special rapporteurs on the right to physical and mental health and on violence against women.",[],"GENEVA: Some US states are exploiting the coronavirus crisis to restrict access to abortion, a group of independent United Nations rights experts said Wednesday.

Talking to The News, Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Maqsood Ahmed Memon, chief of the Security Division, said on Monday that in light of the directives issued by Sindh IGP Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar and Additional IGP Karachi Ghulam Nabi Memon, the Police Security and Emergency Services Division had launched a mobile application called ‘Citizens Monitoring App’ with the aim of restricting the movement of citizens amid the government-imposed lockdown.

The application will be installed in the mobile phones of police officers deputed at police checkpoints, who would record citizens’ movements in the application. So far, 500 officials deployed at different checkpoints have had the application installed in their cellphones.

DIG Memon added that legal action would be initiated against any citizen found moving more than twice a day. The data of citizens will be entered into the application, including the CINC number, phone number, location and reason of commuting.

DIG Memon said that having launched the app, the movements of more than 6,000 citizens had been recorded in the app so far, in East Range’s Korangi District 918 citizens' commuting details were recorded, in District East 1,254, and in District Malir 550 citizens' movements were recorded.

In West Range’s District West, 838 citizens' commuting details were recorded, in District Central 1,044, in South Range’s District South 871 commuters' details were recorded, and 568 citizens' details were recorded in District City of the South Range. A total of 125 citizens were found violating the rules.

He added that this app would be helpful to ensure effective execution of the lockdown. He appealed to the citizens to remain confined to their homes in order to protect themselves from the coronavirus pandemic.­",['Salis Bin Perwaiz'],"The Sindh Police Department’s Security and Emergency Service Division has launched a “Citizen Monitoring App” to limit the movement of citizens amid the ongoing lockdown.

Any future WTO leader will head an organisation mired in stalled trade talks and struggling to curb trade tensions between the United States and China. It must also help member countries navigate a devastating global economic slump sparked by the coronavirus pandemic. The global trade body faces relentless attacks from Washington, which has crippled the WTO dispute settlement appeal system and threatened to leave altogether. Many observers fear that intransigent US positions could paralyse the WTO process of designating a new director general, leaving the organisation leaderless for the foreseeable future. “The US demands that the new DG shares US concerns, many of which are about addressing concerns related to China,” Manfred Elsig, a professor of international relations at the World Trade Institute in Bern told AFP. “Given that the DG is chosen by consensus, this tough stance complicates the selection.

The WTO has already presented a timeline for selecting one of eight candidates in the running to replace Azevedo within a few months. But Elsig warned that “the process is already torpedoed. “It could well be that many WTO members want to wait until after the (US) election, hoping that the administration changes.

Azevedo´s surprise announcement in May that he would end his second WTO term 12 months early forced the organisation to speed up its usually lengthy process of selecting a new leader. Three Africans, two Europeans, two Asians and one Latin American quickly threw their hats in the ring. - ´Confessionals´

The organisation is due next month to begin three rounds of consultations — dubbed “confessionals” — in which all member states confidentially voice their preferences, gradually whittling down the list. The process, based on consensus, is expected to last until mid-November. But soaring international tensions and growing politicisation of picks to head UN agencies and other international organisations could trip up the tentative timeline. Members failed last month to pick an acting chief from among four deputy directors — something that is normally a straightforward process. Brussels and Washington butted heads over whether German Karl Brauner, or American Alan Wolff, should get the job, in what observers say was unprecedented politicisation of an administrative decision.",[],"GENEVA: As Roberto Azevedo leaves the World Trade Organization Monday, the institution faces multiple crises without a captain — a situation experts warn could drag on for months.

“We had arrested 8 suspect yesterday and seven more were taken into custody today,” said the official, adding, the search operations has been going on for the second day to arrest the perpetrators of the heinous crime.

The police officials from Swabi, Mardan and Nowshera have also been included in the investigation team and placed at the disposal of District Police Officer (DPO) Charsadda Mohammad Shoaib to work out the case and bring the accused to justice.

Superintendent of Police (SP) Darvesh Khan is heading the investigation team while Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), City, Iqbal Khan has been replaced with DSP Bashir Yousafzai, who has long experience of dealing with such cases.

Two and a half year old Zainab, daughter of one Akhtar Muni, had gone missing on October 6 while playing outside her home. Her body was found dumped in the fields in Jabba Koroona in the limits of Daudzai Police Station in Peshawar on Wednesday. The body was taken to the Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar, where the postmortem report confirmed that the girl had been raped before being killed.

The police are grilling the arrested persons, including some relatives of Zainab. DPO Mohammad Shoaib said the police had preserved the fingerprints on the body of the victim girl and recovered a lock hair from the crime scene. He added that geo-fencing of the area was being carried out, saying that the police were waiting for the DNA report.

Meanwhile, federal Minister Mohammad Ali Khan visited the bereaved family and expressed sympathy with the parents of the victim. He assured her family that no effort would be spared to bring the accused to justice. Akhtar Munir, father of Zainab, expressed satisfaction over the progress so far made in the case.

He said that Zainab’s mother had become hysterical after learning about her rape and subsequent murder. Also, Jamaat-e-Islami provincial head Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Qaumi Watan Party provincial chief Sikandar Hayat Khan Sherpao also visited the family and expressed deep sorrow and grief over the incident. They demanded the government to provide justice to the family and arrest the perpetrators at the earliest. The two leaders asked the government to introduce strict laws to get the accused punished severely in order to check this menace. The government has failed to protect the life of the citizens, they alleged.

In Peshawar, the activists of Pakistan Citizen Organisation (PCO) staged a protest to demand the arrest of the killers of Zainab. Led by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) MPA Rabbia Basri, the activists chanted slogans against the people involved in such crimes. The protesters marched on the road and urged the government to award exemplary punishment to the culprits of such rape-cum-murder cases.

They appealed to the chief of army staff and chief justice of Pakistan to provide justice to the victims by awarding strict punishment to the criminals so that no one could dare to commit such crimes against the innocent children. They said they would continue the protest till the acceptance of their demands and arrest of the criminals.",['Sab Ali Tareen'],"CHARSADDA: The police have arrested seven more suspects in the rape-cum-murder case of a minor girl in the district on Friday, officials said.

1904,917,1371,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/752698-rule-of-law-as-blackmail,,Rule of law as ‘blackmail’,"Literature on the justice system in Pakistan states that litigants often use delay as a strategy in their court cases to impose costs on the opposing parties.

Basically, rule of law is used as a tool to ‘blackmail’ opponents. This happens in cases in front of the lower judiciary; and also takes place in national politics as we saw in the alleged IG kidnapping case in Sindh a few weeks ago in an episode euphemistically known as the ‘Karachi incident’.

Rule of law has become so dysfunctional that it is used as a blackmailing tool from the lower to the higher levels of socio-political arenas. How to fix this broken system? Osama Siddique wrote an exhaustive report on ‘Caseflow Management in Courts in Punjab’, with outstanding analysis of primary data in 2016 as part of the European Union’s Punjab Access to Justice Project and we are going to refer to it today in this article.

The basic concept of ‘caseflow management’ is that the court system needs an administrative and management arm that directs and monitors the dispensation of justice on the basis of data review. Court proceedings are haphazardly managed in the present system, driven by contending parties and their lawyers and inconsistently monitored by members of inspection teams of high courts. In the present system, the judge does not control the court proceedings effectively; and other stakeholders find plenty of opportunities for delay.

According to Siddique, “Caseflow Management involves (but is not limited to) the entire set of actions that a court takes to monitor and supervise the progress of cases, from initiation to conclusion, including organisation and management of daily dockets, setting calendars and time standards, establishing case processing tracks, management of individual cases, management of the court’s overall pending caseload, vision-setting and strategic planning, budgeting and resource utilisation, and overall judicial policymaking, goal-setting and leadership.”

There is a need to move away from the textual emphasis to a process-driven review of the system. Modern caseflow management concepts are largely missing from the court system in Punjab (and also the rest of Pakistan). While there are some statutory guidelines by the high court in terms of rules, orders, and directions to give timelines for stage-wise progression of cases, they are not adequate. Certain stages of a case, such as serving the summons, still take an inordinately long time.

The National Judicial Policy (NJP) also sets overall timelines for the civil and criminal cases’ completion. However, in these guidelines the ‘age’ of the case seems to be the main criterion – and the burden of responsibility is on ‘individual’ judges rather than the institution as a whole. It creates “perverse incentives” because to meet the case disposal targets, the judges make progress on less complex cases as more complex cases take more time and are not differentiated in the prevalent guidelines.

Adjournments are rife in court cases and stay applications elongate the court proceedings. However, they are not dealt with the prevalent management of the court system. Lawyers also play a crucial role in delaying the proceedings of the cases to increase their earnings; they also resist and block any judicial reform efforts. Yet, little effort has been made to neutralize this negative role of the bar.

The report’s primary data collection was done in three districts of Multan, Muzaffargarh, and Bahawalpur in Punjab. One of the strong findings is that only 25 percent of civil cases and 12 percent of criminal cases were decided on ‘merits’ and availed the full legal recourse. Other cases were disposed of in earlier stages as a result of them being withdrawn or as a result of compromise etc. The pre-trial scrutiny of cases is really weak. Unlike modern caseflow management principles, where there is adequate pre-trial scrutiny of cases to avoid frivolous litigation, both pre and post trial scrutiny are terribly weak over here. Systematic data collection and analysis is almost non-existent and court records are in a shambolic state. Criminal cases have very weak investigation and prosecution.

As practised in countries with a functional justice system, there is a need to impose costs and penalize the delay. That is not done; hence, delay is used as a strategy to deny justice by the contending parties and their lawyers.

There is no single, dynamic, coordinated and integrated caseflow management document that ties all the ends for the smooth flow of court procedures. Rather, the prevalent guidelines are thinly “spread across the Civil Code, the Criminal Code, other applicable procedural laws, the Lahore High Court (LHC) Rules and Orders, relevant judgements of the Supreme Court and the high courts, and administrative directions, notifications and instructions of the LHC of very different vintage.”

There is also a need to re-examine and update the outdated current rules and aspects of court supervision and replace them with the adoption of rule-based unified systems with new rules to fill the existing gaps. New filing formats also need to be introduced where the bulk of required information can be provided. The written evidence should also be accepted. Right now, so much time is wasted on gathering oral evidence. Similarly, technology and audio-visual tools should be used to expedite the proceedings.

The judicial policy should establish ‘judicial control’ over the deliberations of court proceedings. There should also be institutionalization of a ‘case screening approach’. There is also a need for a framework for ‘stage-wise times’ for categories of different cases. Continuous management and monitoring of cases is required.

As a follow-up of the report, the Lahore High Court has deliberated amendments to civil and criminal procedures in the last two years. However, they are not implemented yet. It also remains to be seen how much the new rules are diluted from the recommendations of the report.

EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson told Germany´s Die Welt daily that she wanted to lead “a more efficient fight” against the scourge of child abuse, including through closer cooperation with social media companies. “Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for material showing the sexual abuse of children has risen by 30 percent in some member states,” she said in comments translated into German. The new plan, which Johansson said would be presented “soon”, would include the creation of a new EU centre to help member states “investigate, prevent and combat child sex abuse” and facilitate cross-border information sharing. She also called for tougher action against perpetrators. “We need prevention strategies but we can´t rely on that alone,” Johansson said. “We also need to enforce our laws when they are broken and show that our values prevail, both on the internet and in real life.

EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson told Germany´s Die Welt daily that she wanted to lead “a more efficient fight” against the scourge of child abuse, including through closer cooperation with social media companies.
“Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for material showing the sexual abuse of children has risen by 30 percent in some member states,” she said in comments translated into German.
The new plan, which Johansson said would be presented “soon”, would include the creation of a new EU centre to help member states “investigate, prevent and combat child sex abuse” and facilitate cross-border information sharing.

There are at least 11 rape cases reported in Pakistan every day with over 22,000 rape cases reported to police across the country in the last six years, according to official statistics. However, only 77 accused have been convicted which comprise 0.3% of the total figure.

These statistics were obtained from the Police, Law, and Justice Commission of Pakistan, Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, Women's Foundation, and provincial welfare agencies.

According to a Geo News investigation, only 41% of rape cases are reported to the police due to social pressures and loopholes in the law and order system.

Police officials noted that only half of the rape cases are registered and the actual number of rape cases in the last five years could be as high as 60,000.

In addition, out of the total reported cases, 2,727 challans — or just 12% of the total cases — were filed in the courts, while a decision was given in 1,274, or 5% of them, with 1,192 accused acquitted.

1619,632,956,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/710564-no-honour-in-murder,,No honour in murder,"The verdict delivered by a two-member bench of the Supreme Court that ‘honour killings’ are not honourable at all, and in fact just the opposite, serves women well in the country. In Pakistan today, over a thousand women are killed each year in the name of honour, according to data collected by various NGOs and the media. This of course, is far too many. There are also male victims of honour crimes, when both a woman and the man she has chosen to wed are murdered in the name of honour. Justice Faiz Isa in his detailed verdict, stated that the word ‘honour’, stems from the Urdu word ‘ghairat’ but that this was a mistranslation of the term. He said that because of this, it is often interpreted by people that an honour crime is something carried out in a worthy cause, and therefore, something which is worthy of praise. He said just the opposite is true. And that religious laws make this quite clear by banishing murder of this kind.

The two-member bench was hearing an appeal by a man already in jail who had filed a petition in 2015 against being imprisoned for the killing of his wife. He had originally been sentenced to death by a sessions court. But the Lahore High Court changed this to a term of life imprisonment on the basis that he had fired just once to kill his wife, and that this was an honour crime. Justice Faiz Isa emphasized the need for honour killings to be stopped. In this situation, he praised the efforts of the National Assembly and pointed out that it had passed several laws, which made it difficult for people to escape the maximum sentence by using ‘honour’ as the excuse to get away with what was pointblank murder.

We know that such crimes take place frequently in our country. Not all of them are reported. It is unclear how many may go unnoticed and undocumented in the records of any organization or any other institution. This in itself is highly disturbing. This is also disturbing that society continues to accept such crimes so widely. A murder in the name of honour is murder. There is nothing honourable about it, and the excuse that the killing is intended to save the reputation of the family and especially its male members, has been refuted time and again, by religious scholars. The matter needs to be taken up at more forums. The verdict delivered by the Supreme Court will help in this cause. It is essential that we act more firmly to stop honour killings of all kinds and protect women against such acts of violence carried out most often by their own family members. Justice Isa and his compatriot on the bench have done well in this case. We hope the matter can generate a broader debate on honour killings and lead towards laws, which can bring such killings to an end in a country that has seen far too many of them over the last many decades.",[],"There are also male victims of honour crimes, when both a woman and the man she has chosen to wed are murdered in the name of honour.

Incomplete and improper investigations make these cases weak right from their inception, and this justice system is in dire need of special legislation to prevent this barbaric practice.

—- the pathetic state of Karachi after the heavy rains and how it speaks volumes of the state of the poor governance by the provincial government. People say instead of pointing fingers at the federal government and indulging in petty politics of the blame game, the provincial government should get its act together and solve the problems of the poor citizens who have to live in appalling conditions, surrounded by sewage water and filth while their elected representatives live in comfort.

—- the repeated directives of those in authority that cattle markets will operate under strict SOPs and how this sounds good in the media but is not doable in practice as the general public is not willing to follow guidelines and the governments writ is zero. People say besides the cattle markets, which operate during the day, small herds of cows, goats and even camels are seen at night in remote spots as there are no security personnel to control their influx.

—- how the word ‘demand’ is used by protesters from all sections of society and even the media, instead of using words that have a more appealing sound that does not raise the hackles of the authorities they are protesting against. People say the difference between ‘demand’ and, for instance, ‘request’ or ‘appeal’ makes a world of difference and could lead the authorities to consider the problems of protesters and find a solution, rather than have a standoff or strike.

—- media reports that the NA committee held a meeting to probe into the sale or joint venture option (JVO) of PIA’s Hotel Roosevelt and the confrontation it caused between the government and the opposition. People say it is important that the government of Pakistan wait for the market to stabilise before finalising the JVO, while ensuring that the individual appointed by them to head PIA Investments Limited (PIAIL) is a person of integrity and does not hold any dual nationality to evade accountability.—-

—- the shocking news that a Buddha statue discovered during construction activity in KP’s Mardan district was smashed into pieces on Saturday by locals and how it shows the extent of ignorance prevalent in certain areas. People say the statue was discovered while digging for construction was taking place and the locals took sledgehammers and destroyed a valuable artifact that could have been an additional tourist attraction of Buddhist culture and heritage if it had been preserved.

—- the plan to extend Rawalpindi city and how it does not appeal to old timers who feel the city is already overextended since it first came into being, gobbling up all the arable and scenic land near its precincts and making a concrete jungle of one of the prettiest cities in Pakistan. People say if development of this type was necessary, planning a completely new town in an area where the ground was not useful for growing food would have been a better option. — I.H.",[],"—- the practice of ‘Karo Kari’ - a formal term used for honor killing mainly in Sindh.

The deputy director of the FIA’s Cyber Crime Wing, Mohammad Iqbal, said several pornographic and sexually explicit videos were recovered from the suspect during the raid. A first information report (FIR) has been registered against him as well, he added.

The man befriended children through PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, an online battle royale game popularly known as PUBG, and multiplayer video game 8 Ball Pool, Iqbal explained.

The FIA official said the suspect also used to solicit sexually explicit videos from children by luring them in with offers of giving them PUBG’s in-game currency, G-Coins.

“In the past, the culprit had forced some children into sending him videos of their families, after which he would blackmail them,” he added. The parents of one of the kids had earlier submitted a request to investigate the matter and register a case against the suspect, Iqbal explained. The alleged paedophile has cyber-abused and threatened children from Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Punjab along with their families, the FIA official said. The criminal investigation and cybercrime agency was investigating the sale of pornographic videos by the suspect as well, Iqbal stated. Earlier this week, another Pakistani man from Punjab was arrested for allegedly sharing and owning sexually-explicit videos of kids after Brazil — through the help of the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) — shared documents and other evidence linking him to an international child pornography ring.

The parents of one of the kids had earlier submitted a request to investigate the matter and register a case against the suspect, Iqbal explained.","['held', 'children', 'man', 'used', 'videos', 'explicit', 'suspect', 'iqbal', 'wing', 'sexually', 'using', 'pubg', 'pool', 'kids', 'fia', 'sending']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/700X390_thenews.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'Sending sexually explicit videos: Man held for using PUBG, 8 Ball Pool to blackmail kids | Top Story | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'GUJRANWALA: A man who used online games such as PUBG and 8 Ball Pool to blackmail children into sending sexually explicit videos has been arrested, the Federal Investigation Agency  confirmed on...', 'keywords': 'sending,sexually,explicit,videos,held,pubg,ball,pool,blackmail,kids', 'fb': {'app_id': 650123461797330}, 'og': {'title': 'Sending sexually explicit videos: Man held for using PUBG, 8 Ball Pool to blackmail kids', 'image': {'identifier': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'secure_url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'width': 390}, 'description': 'GUJRANWALA: A man who used online games such as PUBG and 8 Ball Pool to blackmail children into sending sexually explicit videos has been arrested, the Federal Investigation Agency  confirmed on...', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/755040-sending-sexually-explicit-videos-man-held-for-using-pubg-8-ball-pool-to-blackmail-kids', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@thenews_intl', 'creator': '@NRNews Report', 'title': 'Sending sexually explicit videos: Man held for using PUBG, 8 Ball Pool to blackmail kids', 'description': 'GUJRANWALA: A man who used online games such as PUBG and 8 Ball Pool to blackmail children into sending sexually explicit videos has been arrested, the Federal Investigation Agency  confirmed on...', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg?t=015426'}, 'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style': 'black-translucent', 'apple-mobile-web-app-title': 'The News International', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#333333', 'theme-color': '#000000'})",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,news,"December 7, 2020",2020-12-07

1187,200,324,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/690387-nz-mp-quits-after-allegedly-sending-sexually-explicit-image,,NZ MP quits after allegedly sending sexually explicit image,"WELLINGTON: A lawmaker from New Zealand’s main opposition party resigned on Tuesday after being accused of sending a sexually explicit image to a young woman, foreign media reported.

It was the latest in a series of resignations and scandals at the National Party, which faces the challenge of trying to unseat the centre-left Labour coalition led by popular leader Jacinda Ardern in the September general election.

The lawmaker, Andrew Falloon, said in a statement on Monday that he will not be contesting in the September polls, and apologised for a “number of mistakes” without giving details. He said he had been dealing with some mental issues following the suicide of a friend.

But Falloon quit parliament immediately on Tuesday after it was revealed in the media that he had sent an unsolicited and indecent image to a 19-year-old woman.

“I am absolutely appalled by what I have been hearing this morning,” National’s newly elected leader Judith Collins said.

The matter came to light after a university student made a complaint to Ardern’s office last week, who passed it on to Collins, the Prime Minister’s office said.

Falloon was not immediately available for comment and the National Party declined give details of his whereabouts.

Collins was handed reins of the National party just last week amid a series of scandals and an exodus of senior leaders, which threaten to damage National’s chances at the polls.

Earlier this month, National Party member Hamish Walker resigned after admitting to leaking names of coronavirus patients to the media.

Shortly after, former National Party Chief Todd Muller quit just over 50 days into the job, saying it was affecting his health. Just two days later Muller’s deputy Nikki Kaye and senior leader Amy Adams also said they will not contest in the elections.

Opinion polls last month showed Ardern’s Labour Party would be able to govern alone with 50% support while National only had 38%.",['News Report'],"WELLINGTON: A lawmaker from New Zealand’s main opposition party resigned on Tuesday after being accused of sending a sexually explicit image to a young woman, foreign media reported.

1386,399,614,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/754746-women-in-politics,,Women in politics,"Governments, civil society and rights advocacy groups around the world observe 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-based Violence (from November 25 to December 10).

The 16-day campaign calls to eliminate all forms of violence against women by raising awareness; strengthening national institutions; establishing links between local and international forums to end violence; demonstrate solidarity with women as well as creating mechanism to influence governments to implement commitments to end all forms of violence against women and girls.

With Covid-19 resurgence at a peak, the world retreated inside homes due to lockdowns, and reports have shown an alarming escalation in the already existing pandemic of violence against women. While international days draw attention to such key issues, it is conspicuous that women’s absence in decision-making roles is traditionally exacerbated by structural inequalities and pervasive patriarchal culture.

A UN Women study on violence against women in politics in South Asia shows that 60 percent of women do not participate in politics due to fear of violence. The region is home to one-fifth of the world’s population. One-third of South Asian women experience violence throughout their lives – South Asian politics being no different. Female candidates, their families and voters routinely face threats. These forms of political and electoral violence are largely obscured from the public eye, mainly because they happen in private spaces or due to prevailing gender normative patterns.

In Pakistan, more women than ever before are participating in political activity. Despite gains, women have traditionally remained underrepresented in the face of systemic challenges to take up positions in the political and public sphere. In defiance of the fact that Pakistan has had a woman prime minister twice and a woman speaker of the National Assembly, patriarchal notions of power-sharing and decision-making guide institutional structure at the level of family, community and the state. The major obstacles that women face in the context of political representation, empowerment and decision-making are low levels of literacy, low economic dividends, disproportionate share of responsibility for the family and home.

The quality of democracy’s institutional architecture in Pakistan depends on whether it has a strong foundation of shared democratic values and principles. Democratic values are more likely to flourish and endure when all segments of society are allowed free participation. To allow citizens’ agency to influence political outcomes without reprisal sets the bases of an inclusive and participatory democracy.

While discrimination and stereotypes lead to marginalization of gender and community groups, women political workers share common obstacles to political participation – variations in religion, sect, age, socio and economic status, or geography impacts them further. Psychological violence, especially through social media, is particularly widespread; being young, or from a minority community or a female opposition member may aggravate the situation.

Legislatures play a central role in developing legislation and allocating resources in order to promote the implementation of gender priorities, especially international commitments. The Beijing Platform for Action (1995), Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) as well as the gender-sensitive implementation of the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals – all lay the foundation of gender cooperation at international fora.

The constitution of Pakistan negates any discrimination on the basis of gender. Articles 25(3) and 34 are the two most significant articles in favor of women.

Claiming political space for women participation and representation is key to safeguard the rights and interests of half of the population. The electoral reforms of 2017 institutionalized women’s political participation on general seats while simultaneously preserving reserve seat quotas. Five percent allocation of seats to women within political party offices as well as five percent for general seats tickets; minimum 10 percent women voter turnout – the intervention can not be expected to address deep rooted power imbalance to crumble and fall at well-intended but loosely enforced laws.

While the incumbent National Assembly contemplates a private member bill on increasing women representation on party ticket lists from 5 to 25 percent while 50 percent office-bearers of any political party at the federal, provincial and local levels shall be women. Although the fate of such interventions eventually lies with senior party leaderships, legislative proposals like these set the aspiration for gender equality into practice.

Speaking at a press conference, District Police Officer Shafiullah Khan Gandapur said that raids were being conducted to arrest the main accused identified as Mahmood Aslam who is stated to be paternal cousin of the girls. The two girls aged 16 and 18 were shot dead in Garyum in North Waziristan on May 14.

He said that the family of the slain girls, who were sisters, and the local people did not want the police to investigate the crime. However, he added that the police had registered the case at the Razmak Police Station on behalf of the state and an investigation team had been formed to probe the matter.

It is stated to be the first incident of its kind in North Waziristan, a former tribal agency that became a district when erstwhile Fata was merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The short, 52-second video was made on mobile phone. The two teenaged girls and the man, who recorded the video outdoors, are seen in the footage along with a third woman, who was stated to be the wife of the killer and had been spared.

The DPO said that the family of the girls originally belonged to South Waziristan and had shifted to North Waziristan when the military operation was carried out in their areas. The bodies of the girls were secretly shifted to their native Shaktoi area in South Waziristan for burial.

He said that the father of the two girls was also among the four arrested persons. He added that one of the accused, Umar Ayaz, who allegedly leaked the video, belonged to Torikhel in North Waziristan. The DPO said that the video showing the two girls had been made a year ago and had been recently leaked to social media.

Shafiullah Khan said that the police had formed an investigation team on the instructions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General of Police Sanaullah Abbasi. He vowed that all the accused would soon be brought to justice.

He urged the local people to seek help from the police without any fear or hesitation and the cops would extend all-out support to them keeping in view the local customs and traditions. He added that it was the upmost responsibility of the police to protect the life and property of the local people.",['Our Correspondent'],"MIRANSHAH: The police on Tuesday claimed to have arrested four accused in connection with the recent murder of two teenage girls in the name of honour in North Waziristan.

A Lahori woman on Saturday said that Pakistani cricket skipper Babar Azam subjected her to sexual violence and abuse, Geo News reported.

Speaking during a press conference along with her lawyer, the woman named Hamiza claimed that she was Azam's neighbour and old school mate, adding that the young cricketer tricked her into love and marriage.

""When I asked him to marry me, he tortured me,"" she said. ""I supported him financially when he was struggling before he became famous. I spent millions of rupees on him.""

She said that she called the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to lodge a formal complaint about the cricketer, but they told her off saying it was a personal matter.

When approached, PCB's Director of Media and Communications Samiul Hassan said that this was Babar's private matter and the board could not comment on it.



The woman's lawyer added that an FIR had been lodged with the Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Lahore regarding the matter but no action was taken.

Hamiza's petition is now pending at the Sessions Court, which is scheduled for a hearing on December 4. The sexual harassment case will be heard on December 5.

Police presented Syed Azhar Ali before the District South judicial magistrate XXVIII on the expiry of his physical remand. The investigation officer (IO) informed the court that the suspect’s custody was no longer required for investigations.

The IO also submitted a progress report to the magistrate, stating that Nikah Khawan Qazi Abdur Rasool had obtained interim pre-arrest bail from a District South additional sessions court against a surety of Rs50,000.

He added that police were searching for the other suspects who acted as the Vakil and witnesses during the nikah of 14-year-old Arzoo with Ali who is said to be thrice her age. He sought more time from the court to arrest the absconders.

According to the FIR which was lodged by the girl’s father Raja, the girl went missing on October 13 after which he approached police to find her. Later it transpired that she was in the custody of Ali.

Police had arrested Ali’s brothers, Syed Shariq Ali and Syed Mohsin Ali, and his friend Danish over their alleged involvement in the abduction and forced conversion. However, they were granted bail by the same sessions judge.

Initially, the FIR was lodged under the section 364-A (kidnapping or abducting a person under the age of 14) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Frere police station. Later, provisions of the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act were incorporated in the FIR on the directives of the Sindh High Court.","['Oc', 'Our Correspondent']","A local court on Thursday sent a man, who allegedly married minor Christian girl Arzoo, to jail in judicial custody after police completed investigation with him.

1015,28,53,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/712189-police-stations-in-kp-yet-to-get-financial-autonomy,,Police stations in KP yet to get financial autonomy,"PESHAWAR: Though the provincial government issued a notification in March that declared the station house officers (SHOs) as Drawing and Disbursing Officers (DDOs), no police station has yet been given financial autonomy.

Many junior officers believe that financial autonomy to the SHOs would help improve policing. “Following a notification by the provincial government in March, a number of SHOs applied to be given the DDO powers. Some of them have prepared their own budget. However, the process of giving them financial autonomy is yet to start,” a source told The News.

The source said the post of junior clerks were also advertised to maintain record at the police stations in KP. The federal government last year proposed reforms in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab Police, seeking input from the officials concerned in the two provinces.

Under the proposed reforms, the SHOs were supposed to be given financial autonomy. Presently, the police stations get funds from the police lines. Many junior policemen said the SHOs used to contribute from ‘own resources’ for running the affairs of the police station due to lack of enough funds. The officers believed that a district police head should post an upright and competent cop as SHO and give him financial autonomy to improve law and order in his area.

“When given financial powers and due respect as a responsible officer, seniors can hold the SHO accountable if he doesn’t perform well or if he is found involved in any irregularity or wrongdoing,” said a junior police officer, who has also submitted an application to be given the DDO powers.

The official admitted that some SHOs may face problems in preparing the budget and dealing with other account related issues but the bosses should post the right man for the right job. The provincial police authorities recently asked for an increased budget for fuel for the police stations that get only 10 litre fuel per official vehicle per day for patrolling. Many police stations don’t have enough patrolling cars to cover the entire area.",['Javed Aziz Khan'],"PESHAWAR: Though the provincial government issued a notification in March that declared the station house officers (SHOs) as Drawing and Disbursing Officers (DDOs), no police station has yet been given financial autonomy.
Many junior officers believe that financial autonomy to the SHOs would help improve policing.
However, the process of giving them financial autonomy is yet to start,” a source told The News.
The source said the post of junior clerks were also advertised to maintain record at the police stations in KP.
Under the proposed reforms, the SHOs were supposed to be given financial autonomy.","['given', 'kp', 'junior', 'post', 'shos', 'stations', 'financial', 'autonomy', 'station', 'provincial', 'officers']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/700X390_thenews.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-11/ss_756866_073204_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-09-09/l_712189_115046_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-09-09/712189_2949102_kpk,police_akhbar.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-11/ss_756867_073745_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-09-09/l_712189_115046_updates.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'Police stations in KP yet to get financial autonomy | Pakistan | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'PESHAWAR: Though the provincial government issued a notification in March that declared the station house officers  as Drawing and Disbursing Officers , no police station has yet been given...', 'keywords': 'police,stations,financial,autonomy', 'fb': {'app_id': 650123461797330}, 'og': {'title': 'Police stations in KP yet to get financial autonomy', 'image': {'identifier': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-09-09/l_712189_115046_updates.jpg', 'secure_url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-09-09/l_712189_115046_updates.jpg', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'width': 390}, 'description': 'PESHAWAR: Though the provincial government issued a notification in March that declared the station house officers  as Drawing and Disbursing Officers , no police station has yet been given...', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/712189-police-stations-in-kp-yet-to-get-financial-autonomy', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@thenews_intl', 'creator': '@JAKJaved Aziz Khan', 'title': 'Police stations in KP yet to get financial autonomy', 'description': 'PESHAWAR: Though the provincial government issued a notification in March that declared the station house officers  as Drawing and Disbursing Officers , no police station has yet been given...', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-09-09/l_712189_115046_updates.jpg?t=015700'}, 'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style': 'black-translucent', 'apple-mobile-web-app-title': 'The News International', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#333333', 'theme-color': '#000000'})",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,news,"September 9, 2020",2020-09-09

The changes, which were announced on Saturday by the government-run WAM news agency, are intended to “consolidate the UAE’s principles of tolerance” and improve the Gulf nation’s economic and social profile. However, the agency didn’t specify when the new relaxed rules will go into force.

Penalties for alcohol consumption, possession and sales for those 21 and over will be eliminated in the Muslim country, which positions itself as a more Westernized tourist hotspot than other areas in the region. UAE citizens previously required a special license to drink beer and other liquors at bars or at home.

The reform will also allow “cohabitation of unmarried couples.” Such behavior has been considered criminal in UAE for a long time.

The legal clause which allowed the judges to issue merciful sentences to men who commit a so-called “honor killing” has also been removed. Those crimes will from now be treated as a regular murder.

The reform comes amid the US-brokered normalisation of ties between longtime regional foes UAE and Israel, which is expected to bring investment and numerous Israeli tourists to the Gulf country.

Dubai is also hosting the World Expo in 2021-22. It’s planned that some 25 million people will visit the country for the major international event, greatly boosting economic activity in the UAE.

The draft law does not include the provision of public hanging of rapists despite Prime Minister Imran Khan's statement that he wants to make an example of rapists by hanging them in public. A presentation on the draft law by the prime minister’s advisor on interior Barrister Shahzad Akbar also suggested chemical castration for convicts having a past history of sexual offences and seven to 14 years imprisonment for an attempt to rape. All these offences are recommended to be made non-compoundable, non-bailable and cognizable.

The salient features of the proposed law include gender sensitive investigations and prosecution; a comprehensive definition of ‘rape’ and ‘consent’; the setting up of special courts; protection of the victim’s identity; person defined as children, male, female or transgender; in-camera trial and recording of evidence through video link; exemplary punishments such as chemical castration; monitoring by the National Commission on Status of Women and constitution of Rape Crises Cells; rehabilitation and provision of legal aid to victims and psychological rehabilitation of convicts. Rape Crises Cells at the federal, provincial and district levels will be headed by female policer officers of BS 21, BS 20 and BS 18 respectively.

For investigation into rape cases, the proposed law suggests the appointment of female investigation officers of BPS 17 or above who will be provided gender sensitive training.Investigation will be completed within 30 days. A registry of sex offenders will also be compiled.

For speedy and effective prosecution, the draft law suggests the establishment of special courts and the appointment of public prosecutors and female presiding officers. Rape case trials will be concluded within 45 days. The proceedings of rape cases will be in-camera to ensure the victim’s identity remains anonymous; there will be a punishment for revealing the victim's identity. During the trial, evidence of witnesses and victims will be conducted via video link.

The proposed law has been referred to the legislative committee of the cabinet. Following the recent Lahore Motorway incident, the prime minister had announced that severe punishments will be included in the present law to make an example of rapists. The premier had assigned his Advisor on Interior Barrister Shahzad Akbar to propose a new law to check the growing incidents of the rape of women, children and transgender persons in the country.",['Ansar Abbasi'],"ISLAMABAD: The draft Anti Rape (Investigation & Prosecution) Act 2020, presented before the cabinet on Tuesday, proposes the death penalty for gang rape offenders as well as for the offence of rape with the intention of murder.

SUKKUR: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Vice President and leader of the parliamentary party in Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh on Friday demanded justice for a victim of gang-rape in Jati, district Sujawal.

The victim, Aisha Thaimor, was kidnapped and kept in illegal detention in Jati, district Sujawal, for 10 days and she was subjected to gang-rape. The police allegedly only lodged a case against three of the five suspects after extracting Rs140,000 from the victim’s father.

PTI MPA Haleem Adil visited the victim’s house in Jati and assured her family of full medical and legal assistance. Demanding justice, he asked the police to quickly round up all the five suspects. He strongly criticized the law enforcement agency for extorting Rs140,000 from the victim’s father to file the FIR and that too by ignoring the names of two suspects. He pledged to arrange proper medical treatment and cash assistance of Rs25,000 from the Pakistan Baitul Mal.",[],"The victim, Aisha Thaimor, was kidnapped and kept in illegal detention in Jati, district Sujawal, for 10 days and she was subjected to gang-rape.

- Gender parity -

Only six of 18 competition films are directed by women, meaning the Berlinale is still some way off gender parity in its competition line-up.

Yet according to Delphyne Besse from the pro-parity ""50/50 for 2020"" collective, Berlin is the film festival ""which does the most"" to ensure female representation.

Though there are fewer female directors up for the Golden Bear this year than in 2019, the number is still considerably higher than rival festival Venice, where only two of 21 films were directed by women last year.

Historically, women have also won more prizes in Berlin than at any other festival.

Six women have won the Golden Bear -- including two in the last three years -- compared to just one female winner of the Palme d´Or at Cannes (New Zealander Jane Campion in 1993).

Since last year, the festival has also published statistics on the number of women in its selection committees and in the production of the films themselves.

- Sensitive questions -

A number of films on the Berlinale programme this year tackle sensitive questions around women´s rights and representation.

Eliza Hittmann´s film about a teenage abortion ""Never Rarely Sometimes Always"" is up for the Golden Bear, while Kitty Green´s ""The Assistant"" has caused such a stir that organisers were forced to schedule an extra screening.

Green´s film traces the daily struggle of a young female graduate working as an assistant in a New York production company.

Amid hostility from her colleagues and visits paid to her boss by attractive young women, the protagonist Jane (played by ""Ozark"" star Julia Garner) becomes aware she is working in an abusive environment.

Trained documentary-maker Green explained that the film is based on ""hundreds of hours of interviews"", including with women who worked under former producer Weinstein, who was convicted of rape and sexual assault on Monday.

Yet such ""extremely toxic environments"" are to be found in all industries, the director said.

""It´s bigger than Harvey Weinstein,"" added Garner.

""It´s not about a gender war, it´s about putting a stop to abuse.""

- Jury controversy -

But are all films directed by women inherently feminist?

""I am just happy to be making films...despite my sex and my age,"" said celebrated American indie director Kelly Reichardt, 56, with a hint of irritation.

In competition with the critically acclaimed ""First Cow"", a reimagining of the Western genre about a friendship between two men, Reichardt has preferred to emphasise the humanist aspect of her film.

Berlinale jury president Jeremy Irons, meanwhile, was forced to defend himself over controversial comments he had made in 2011 about abortion, sexism and same-sex marriage.

The British Oscar winner said the comments were ""already refuted and apologised for"", and insisted he supported ""wholeheartedly the global movement to address the inequality of women´s rights"".",[],"BERLIN: With a wealth of female directors and a hit film partially based on the Harvey Weinstein revelations, the #MeToo movement is front and centre at the 70th edition of the Berlin film festival this week.

1215,228,362,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/688371-amber-heard-faked-injuries-for-blackmail,,‘Amber Heard faked injuries for blackmail’,"A live-in friend who witnessed Johnny Depp’s tumultuous marriage to Amber Heard told the Hollywood actor’s libel trial on Friday the actress faked her injuries in order to blackmail him.

The ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise star is suing the publisher and executive editor of Britain’s The Sun newspaper in London’s High Court over a 2018 story branding him a ""wife beater"".

The Sun says it can prove the 57-year-old abused the 34-year-old model and actress on 14 occasions before their two-year marriage fell apart in 2017. Depp kicked off proceedings last week by admitting he told Heard after a particularly stormy encounter the two were ""a crime scene waiting to happen"".

But the focus shifted from the actor’s alleged tendency to smash things up while high or drunk to Heard’s credibility as Depp’s various bodyguards and staff took the stand this week. Depp’s childhood friend Isaac Baruch -- an artist who lived in the couple’s five penthouse apartment complex in Los Angeles -- said pictures of Heard’s injuries leaked to the media were ""phoney baloney"".

""She had filed a fraudulent domestic violence claim to push her hand and extort and blackmail him in the divorce,"" Baruch said. One photo in question shows the right side of Heard’s face around her eye covered in red markings.

But Depp’s friend said he saw Heard from ""12 inches away"" the next day and her skin was clear. ""I didn’t see a single bruise, redness, mark or the red tinted cellphone imprint that was advertised in (magazines). Nothing. Not anything,"" Baruch said.

Lawyer Sasha Wass, representing The Sun’s publishers News Group Newspapers (NGN), tried to cast Baruch as an unreliable witness who depended on Depp for his livelihood. She noted that Depp gave Baruch free accommodation and tens of thousand of dollars a year in living expenses.

Wass also asked how Baruch could be sure Heard was not covering up her bruises with makeup. Baruch said he was ""100 percent sure"" because he saw Heard four more times over the next three days.

""I saw no marks of any kind on either side of the face,"" he said. Heard has been attending the hearings daily but will only enter the witness box for the first time Monday. She can expect to be grilled by Depp’s lawyer about whether she had staged or otherwise misrepresented any of the photos of her face submitted to court.

The Sun’s lawyers said they received a notice from Depp’s team on Friday claiming that around 20 of the images had been ""adapted or manipulated"". Depp’s lawyers said the picture Baruch was being asked about had been ""photoshopped"".

Judge Andrew Nicol agreed to look into the matter further next week. But Wass presented an audio recording in which Heard told one of her staff that she covered up her bruises in public. ""I hid it from everyone,"" Heard said in the undated recording played in court.",[],"A live-in friend who witnessed Johnny Depp’s tumultuous marriage to Amber Heard told the Hollywood actor’s libel trial on Friday the actress faked her injuries in order to blackmail him.

On May 28, the accused identified as Bilal could not commit unnatural offence with the victim in his house as the boy’s father reached there while searching for his son.

Victim Feezan’s father Muhammad Arshad of Bhutto Chowk on Bedian Road, South Cantt, told that he found his son missing from the house in the morning at 7am on May 28. He started a search for his son and was attracted by hue and cry being raised by his son from the house of one Bilal living in the same locality. He entered the house and found his son lying naked in Bilal’s room. The accused escaped from the scene. The ill-fated father took his son home who later told that Bilal had already committed unnatural offence with him at least seven to eight times on different occasions.

The victim’s father lodged an FIR against Bilal on May 28, claiming that the accused was about to commit the sin with his son when he reached the spot and the accused fled from the scene. The FIR was registered under Section 377 P.P.C.

While talking to The News, DIG Investigation Lahore Dr Inam Waheed told that a special raiding team had been constituted to trace the culprit who was committing the sin secretly and would have continued to commit the crime if the boy’s father had not woken up earlier on the day of incident.

He said that the police team traced the culprit and others in the recent past by using an arsenal of high-tech systems and gadgets that were designed to enhance public safety, nab delinquents and save lives.

Dr Inam Waheed said that the police team arrested the accused, Bilal, from his house on May 29 and his sample would be submitted to forensic laboratory for DNA on Monday (today).

It is pertinent to mention that the Lahore Investigation Wing unearthed a racket in Nawab Town area some days back and arrested a pedophile who had abused two children and escaped arrest as the victims’ families pardoned him after threats.

One of the victims’ family migrated from Lahore in shame. The accused had to kill his third prey due to sudden arrival of someone in the under-construction plaza where he took the boy to abuse him. And the murder of the 10-year-old boy brought police to the doorstep of the accused within 48 hours, otherwise, he could still be a threat to innocent children.",['Salman Aslam'],"On May 28, the accused identified as Bilal could not commit unnatural offence with the victim in his house as the boy’s father reached there while searching for his son.

1271,284,442,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/652690-violence-in-a-pandemic,,Violence in a pandemic,"Americans are paying dearly as they suffer through the coronavirus epidemic. The costs of inadequate testing, poor medical care and even death in isolation are only compounded by the nation’s staggering economy, mounting unemployment rate and uncertainty of recovery. Making matters worse, there has been an increase in domestic violence.

“My husband won’t let me leave the house,” a victim of domestic violence told a representative for the National Domestic Violence Hotline (NDVH). “He’s had flu-like symptoms and blames keeping me here on not wanting to infect others or bringing something like Covid-19 home. But I feel like it’s just an attempt to isolate me.” The NDVH representative notes that “a growing number of callers say that their abusers are using COVID-19 as a means of further isolating them from their friends and family. “

“I spoke to the [NY] state police this morning and there is a reported uptick in domestic violence cases,” Melissa DeRosa, Gov Andrew Cuomo’s top aide stated at a recent press briefing. “Some reports are as high as 15 to 20 percent. It’s unacceptable on any day. I want people to know that every single case that is reported, the state police is going to investigate fully.”

This assessment was confirmed by Cecile Noel, commissioner of New York City’s Office to End Domestic Violence and Gender-Based Violence (ENDGBV). “Covid-19 puts into sharp focus the vulnerabilities that many people in our city face every day, especially gender-based violence survivors,” she said. And added, “it highlights the barriers and challenges that we know keep people from seeking help and finding safety.”

The same story is playing out in San Francisco. Shortly after shelter-in-place was implemented, the SF district attorney’s office reported an initial 60 percent increase in referrals to its Victim Services Division, compared to the same week last year. Mayor London Nicole Breed and DA Chesa Boudin announced that the city has secured 20 furnished apartments for survivors of domestic violence.

Kathy Black, executive director, La Casa De Las Madres, pointed out that “one of the most common battering tactics is to isolate somebody from their support network – friends, family, coworkers, agencies where they may go to get assistance or support.” Going further, she noted, “So being locked in with your abuser is, as I have called it, kind of a perfect storm.”

Domestic abuse – or intimate partner violence – is an endemic feature of American social life, one example of the all-pervasive sexual or gender violence.

1584,597,904,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/714237-a-few-most-publicised-rape-cases-in-pakistan,,A few most-publicised rape cases in Pakistan,"LAHORE: The gang-rape of a helpless woman, who was stripped of her honour on the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway last Wednesday night, is among the various high-profile and most-publicised cases in Pakistan that have drawn massive national and international attention. Unfortunately, in many of these cases, culprits exploited the grey areas in the criminal jurisprudence, used money and their influence to go scot-free! Here follow brief details of few of these famous rape cases:

On May 13, 1978, Jharna Basak (Shabnam), a renowned Pakistani film actress of yore, was subjected to traumatising ordeal at her house in the posh Gulberg locality of Lahore. Archival research shows that five armed men had entered Shabnam's home and first committed a robbery. After forcibly taking away rupees one lakh cash, jewellery and other household articles, the accused also gang raped Shabnam, in front of her husband, music composer Robin Ghosh, and their only son, Ronnie Ghosh.

After her failure to get her tormentors punished for the crime, this Pakistani actress, now 78, moved to her hometown Bangladesh in the late 1990s, finding it uphill to cope up with the bitter and painful memories of the unforgettable agony. The Lollywood poster girl, who appeared in over 160 movies and was introduced to film-makers in 1968 by legendary actor Waheed Murad. She initially chose London to reside, but then opted for Dhaka. Her son was studying in the United Kingdom at the time of the incident, and it was reported that he too was stalked and haunted by unknown men there in a bid to scare the family and prevent it from pursuing the case.

The seven accused in this case included influential individuals Mohammad Farooq Bandial, Wasim Yaqoob Butt, Jamil Ahmad, Tahir Tanvir, Jamshed Akbar Sahi, Agha Aqueel Ahmad and Mohammad Muzaffar.

All the accused, hailing from influential families, were later tried by the Special Military Court. The culprits had managed to influence local police to not register the case for gang rape. Five of the accused, convicted of robbery, were sentenced to death. Agha Aqueel Ahmad was awarded 10 years’ imprisonment and Mohammad Muzaffar was acquitted, on October 1979.

General Ziaul Haq, the-then president of Pakistan had reportedly commuted the death sentence handed over to the five accused. Shabnam and her family were reportedly and allegedly pressurised by the culprits into pardoning them. One of the accused Farooq Bandial, a politician from district Khushab, Punjab, had joined Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek Insaf ahead of the 2018 General Elections.

Within hours, the story about Bandial’s involvement in rape and robbery case at Shabnam’s house had resurfaced on social media, the growing public outrage then forced Imran Khan to expel him from PTI on May 31, 2018.

PTI leader Naeemul Haq (late) immediately took on twitter to announce the decision. His had tweeted: ""We have no place for people with such record in our party. He [Bandial] should not even be in any political party.""

Two more rape cases in 1983 had flashed headlines in both local and global media. This was the era of General Ziaul Haq’s Islamisation of laws.

The infamous Hudood Ordinances of 1979, conflated rape with zina (fornication), required four male witnesses to prove a sexual crime against a woman.

In 2006, a new Section, 254-A, was inserted in the Pakistan Penal Code through the Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance 1984. It dealt with ""assault or use of criminal force [against a] woman and stripping her clothes"" with a punishment as harsh as death penalty or life imprisonment and a fine (in case of rape).

But, belated rectification and amendments in relevant laws were certainly not enough to compensate an 18-year-old blind girl, Safia Bibi, who was raped by her landlord and his son in 1983.

A resident of the-then NWFP, Safia resultantly became pregnant. She was unable to prove her allegation of rape and was charged with fornication, found guilty, and hence sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment, 15 lashes and a fine of Rs1000 under the 'draconian' Hudood Ordinance. While her pregnancy was cited to prove that she had engaged in extra-marital sex, her assailants were acquitted due to ""want of evidence."" After national and international protest, the Federal Shariat Court acquitted Safia of fornication on appeal.

It was also in 1983 that a 13-year-old orphaned girl, Jehan Mina, was raped by her uncle and his son. She became pregnant too. Unable to convince the court that she was raped, the poor girl was instead given punishment of 100 lashes plus three-year rigorous imprisonment for Zina. The fact that she was pregnant was considered proof by the court that sex outside marriage had taken place.

Then, on November 27, 1991, Premier Benazir Bhutto’s 40-year old close friend Farhana (Veena) Hayat, was gang-raped inside her own house in Karachi. Benazir was not in power then, but was disheartened due to Veena Hayat’s rape and had brought the case for discussion on the National Assembly floor.

According to the FIR filed by her on November 28 at Gizri Police Station, Veena said she was assaulted, raped, and tortured for 12 hours at gunpoint by five assailants who had gagged and tied up her domestic staff too.

Veena Hayat, daughter of a veteran Muslim Leaguer Sardar Shaukat Hayat and grand daughter of Sir Sikandar Hayat (chief minister of pre-partition united Punjab), had blamed Irfanullah Khan Marwat--son-in-law of sitting Pakistani President Ghulam Ishaq Khan -- for orchestrating her rape.

The police had registered Veena's complaint only when the then Army Chief General Asif Nawaz Janjua had intervened. President Ghulam Ishaq Khan was at loggerheads with the-then prime minister Nawaz Sharif.

At that time, Marwat was working as the Sindh chief minister Jam Sadiq Ali’s advisor on home affairs and was a member of the provincial assembly, representing the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad, a coalition of right-wing parties such as the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and the Jamaat-e-Islami among others.

Irfanullah Marwat had denied the allegations and declared the FIR a political move to discredit him. He accused PPP of ""involving ladies to achieve political ends"" – implying that the political entity might have arranged the gang rape itself to malign him.

Shaukat Hayat held a press conference in Islamabad, demanding that Marwat be removed from office and his daughter’s attackers be taken to court. The Sindh government set up a high-level judicial tribunal to investigate the allegations. President Ishaq Khan also reportedly wrote a letter to Shaukat Hayat, admonishing him for making hasty conclusions and urging him to have patience. On December 12, 1991, the tribunal began its inquiry in Karachi. A few suspects had already been held by the police.

Both Veena and her father Shaukat Hayat, suspicious of the government’s sympathy for Marwat, refused to appear in front of the tribunal. They believed a fair trial could not take place as long as Marwat was part of the provincial government.

On December 20 of the same year, after his four-day ultimatum passed, Shaukat Hayat called a 17-member Jirga of tribal elders that gave the death sentence to all those involved in his daughter's case.

Nine days later, on December 29, the tribunal announced its much-anticipated verdict; there was no evidence on record to substantiate Veena’s accusation against Marwat. As for the gang rape, the tribunal concluded that only one of the culprits had committed the rape twice and, therefore, this was not an incident of gang rape. Newspapers had raised hue and cry over the verdict and questioned the disappearance of Veena's cook and driver, the key witnesses.

After Marwat’s acquittal, Veena moved out of Pakistan. Attempts to contact her remained fruitless.

In February 2017, over reports that Irfanullah Marwat had joined the PPP, Asif Ali Zardari's daughters Bakhtawar and Aseefa had reacted very strongly.

In 2002, 30-year-old Mukhtaran Bibi of Muzaffargarh district (Punjab) was gang raped on the orders of the local village council as an ""honour rape"" after allegations that her 12-year-old brother had had sexual relations with a woman from a higher caste.

The case was picked up by a large section of both domestic and international media.

On September 1, 2002, an anti-terrorist court had sentenced 6 men (including the 4 rapists) to death for rape, but in 2005, the Lahore High Court had acquitted 5 of the 6 convicted men due to insufficient evidence and commuted the punishment for the sixth man to a life sentence.

The aggrieved woman and the government of the time went into an appeal and the Supreme Court upheld the Lahore High Court decision, acquitting the accused.

In January 2005, Dr Shazia Khalid---an employee of a state-owned natural gas firm--was raped in Sui (Balochistan). She was working at the company's hospital for the past 18 months while living alone in heavily guarded government-provided accommodation. She was strangled with a cord, threatened, blindfolded, pistol-whipped, beaten and repeatedly raped by a powerful masked intruder. Her husband, Khalid, in Libya at the time, had rushed back to Pakistan to be reunited with his wife. With his support, Shazia reported the crime, which led to a violent uprising by the Bugti tribe in restive Balochistan. The fuming protestors disrupted the supply of gas to much of the country for several weeks. By some accounts, up to 10,000 soldiers and police were brought in to quell the rebellion. In March 2005, Shazia and her husband left Pakistan on a flight to London. She later applied for asylum in Canada but her application was refused.

Another rape case was reported in September 2008, where a widow resident named, Firdaus Bibi, was also gang-raped in the same gas company's residential compound. A case was registered against nine officials of the company and the security guards.

In 2007, a 13-year-old schoolgirl, Kainat Soomro, was kidnapped and gang-raped for four days in her native village of Mehar in Sindh.

Kainat and family then fled to Karachi. Her brother was murdered and she was attacked twice—once at her house and the second time at the city court. Court had ruled that the accused were innocent, stating that there was no corroborative evidence available on record. All four men accused of Kainat's rape were hence acquitted. Amid an uproar from human rights activists, Kainat filed a petition in the Sindh High Court. It took two years for the hearing to finally begin, but to no avail!

This particular case too had attracted massive international attention. In 2014, one of her kidneys had stopped working. The other had developed stones and doctors had recommended a surgery.",['Sabir Shah'],"The culprits had managed to influence local police to not register the case for gang rape.

Another rape case was reported in September 2008, where a widow resident named, Firdaus Bibi, was also gang-raped in the same gas company's residential compound.","['raped', 'marwat', 'pakistan', 'case', 'cases', 'accused', 'mostpublicised', 'hayat', 'rape', 'gang', 'court', 'veena']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/700X390_thenews.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-09-13/l_714237_052942_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-09-13/714237_7939598_rape_akhbar.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-09-13/l_714237_052942_updates.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'A few most-publicised rape cases in Pakistan | Top Story | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'LAHORE: The gang-rape of a helpless woman, who was stripped of her honour on the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway last Wednesday night, is among the various high-profile and most-publicised cases in Pakistan...', 'keywords': 'publicised,rape,cases,pakistan', 'fb': {'app_id': 650123461797330}, 'og': {'title': 'A few most-publicised rape cases in Pakistan', 'image': {'identifier': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-09-13/l_714237_052942_updates.jpg', 'secure_url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-09-13/l_714237_052942_updates.jpg', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'width': 390}, 'description': 'LAHORE: The gang-rape of a helpless woman, who was stripped of her honour on the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway last Wednesday night, is among the various high-profile and most-publicised cases in Pakistan...', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/714237-a-few-most-publicised-rape-cases-in-pakistan', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@thenews_intl', 'creator': '@SSSabir Shah', 'title': 'A few most-publicised rape cases in Pakistan', 'description': 'LAHORE: The gang-rape of a helpless woman, who was stripped of her honour on the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway last Wednesday night, is among the various high-profile and most-publicised cases in Pakistan...', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-09-13/l_714237_052942_updates.jpg?t=015652'}, 'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style': 'black-translucent', 'apple-mobile-web-app-title': 'The News International', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#333333', 'theme-color': '#000000'})",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,news,"September 13, 2020",2020-09-13

Natasha Ali and other petitioners said that medico-legal officers (MLOs) perform hymen tests and two-finger tests as part of the medical evaluation of sexual assault victims, adding that such tests are unreliable, unnecessary and without any scientific basis.

They said the people accused of having committed rape are mostly acquitted either for want of evidence or on unsubstantiated suggestions of the victims being promiscuous or immoral in conduct, adding that these standards defy the constitutional liberties vesting in and with all citizens, including victims of sexual assaults.

They also said that other nations comprising the subcontinent have outlawed such practices as being unlawful and in violation of basic human rights, adding that there is a need for judicial intervention premised on similar standards.

The petitioners said the government has made amendments in the criminal procedure law making DNA tests in sexual assault cases mandatory, adding that the superior courts have also ordered that DNA tests be conducted in all rape cases.

They said that despite the significance of the courts’ decision in highlighting the role of DNA evidence, a large-scale shift among investigating officers and their attitude towards the collection of DNA evidence in all sexual offences is yet to be observed. It has been reported in the media that Sindh is ill-equipped as regards the availability of qualified MLOs, and this insufficiency has demonstrated further dwindling numbers in so far as female MLOs are concerned, they added.

They also said that there are reportedly only four female MLOs in the entire Karachi, adding that the health department is required to enforce in the larger public interest. They requested the court to direct the home and health departments to stop two-finger tests in rape cases, and to ensure the implementation of DNA tests and the standard operating procedures germane to good medical practice as regards medical examinations, investigations and criminal prosecution of allegations in sexual assaults cases.

They also sought the induction of qualified female MLOs duly accredited with modern medical practices. The SHC’s division bench headed by Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar directed the provincial law officer, the home and health departments, the SHCC and others to file their comments on the petition within two weeks.

PSM retired employees

The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Thursday directed the federal government to deposit the outstanding Rs11.680 billion post-retirement benefits of the Pakistan Steel Mills (PSM) employees by September 30.

The direction came on petitions filed by Syed Umar Baqi and 850 other PSM workers who had moved the SHC against the non-payment of their gratuities, leaves encashment and provident funds since May 2013.

PSM Chief Executive Officer Shujah Hasan submitted a compliance report and stated that the post-retirement benefits of the petitioners had been deposited before the Nazir of the court in compliance with the court order. The Nazir also confirmed that an amount of Rs11.41 billion had been received in compliance with the May 18 order of the high court.

To a court query about the post-retirement benefits of all such retired employees of PSM who had not approached the court and allotment of their outstanding dues, the PSM CEO submitted that the total amount payable to such retired employees was Rs11.680 billion.

“We want exemplary punishment for the cleric, who had assaulted a seminary student and those who harboured him after this heinous crime,” Mohammad Shoaib, the former president of traders’ union, told the protesters who had gathered outside the Ghazikot Township here.

The protesters were holding banners and placards inscribed with slogans in support of their demands. They demanded the arrest of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) leader Mufti Kifayatullah who, according to them, had provided shelter to the suspect before his arrest in the assault case of a seminary student.

The children were also holding placards inscribed with a slogan ‘No mercy for child rapists’. Shoaib said that Wafaqul Madaras should not be blamed for such an inhuman act committed by some black sheep in that noble profession.

1567,580,881,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/716493-motorway-gang-rape-victim-has-identified-both-accused-chohan,,Motorway gang rape: Victim has identified both accused: Fayyazul Hassan Chohan,"LAHORE: Punjab Information Minister Fayyazul Hassan Chohan on Thursday announced that the Motorway gang-rape victim has identified both perpetrators of the crime.

""The woman has identified both Abid and Shafqat,"" Chohan told a press conference in Lahore. He said the victim also promised cooperation with the authorities for further investigation into the case. ""It was due to Waqarul Hasan’s arrest that we were able to reach Shafqat,"" he added.

Abid Ali, the prime suspect in the case, remains at large, while Shafqat Ali was arrested on Monday for his alleged involvement in the case. Chohan, flanked by Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Lahore Umar Sheikh, the minister said all sections of the police were working diligently and close contacts of the main accused, Abid Ali, were in police custody.

About the controversial statement of the CCPO, he said Umar Sheikh had admitted his mistake and apologised, but the opposition leader Shahbaz Sharif, instead of expressing solidarity with the affected family on the floor of the National Assembly, proudly made a false claim to have started the construction of Lahore-Sialkot Motorway during his tenure. He should have apologised to the nation on the Assembly floor, Chohan said.

The information minister said the Punjab CM was considering authorising Punjab Police to take action against any negative activity related to cyber crime or sectarianism in the province. He said that Shahbaz Sharif, who had repeatedly accused the PTI government of changing inspector general of police (IGP) Punjab, had changed nine IGs in his 10-year tenure. ""Unlike previous governments, our manifesto is to serve people better instead of useless drama,"" he added.

He also told the media that an uncouth youth threatening a girl on the social media had also been arrested. He congratulated the CCPO Lahore and ASP Raza Tanvir for arresting the accused and his father within 10 hours on the instructions of Prime Minister Imran Khan and Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar.

He said now there was a clear difference in the attitude of Lahore Police in particular and Punjab Police in general. He said that no hooligan, bully and vagrant character would be allowed to cast an evil eye on mothers, sisters and daughters.

He said any victim of blackmail should contact his office if there was no redress of any complaint in this regard. He said all institutions should overcome their shortcomings and improve their dealings so that the confidence of people in the government and institutions could be restored.

He said that during the tenure of Shahbaz Sharif, the Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) sponsored and backed qabza mafia and drug-dealers through and within the police. The minister said PM Imran Khan exercised zero tolerance policy for qabza mafia and black-mailers.

According to Kasur correspondent, a search operation was conducted in Kasur area, in the limits of Raja Jang police station Wednesday night for the arrest of main accused Abid.

Five relatives of the accused Abid, including a woman, are still in custody in the case. A contingent of the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and police cordoned off Rao Khanwala area of Raja Jang police station and its adjoining settlements. House-to-house search was also conducted. However, the main accused could not be arrested.

In another development, police also recorded the initial statement of the wife of prime suspect Abid Ali. Bushra Bibi said her husband looked worried when he returned home after the incident and fled when he was identified. She said she was not aware of her husband’s present location.

Police had arrested Bushra Bibi, a resident of tehsil Tandlianwala district Faisalabad on Wednesday. She had contracted second marriage with the suspect and had four children from her first marriage and one daughter from Abid.

Bushra and Abid had escaped when the authorities made an attempt to arrest the accused in Sheikhupura. Their daughter is in police custody after the parents abandoned her while fleeing their house.

Five relatives of Abid Ali were arrested on Wednesday night as Lahore Police carried out an operation in Rao Khan Wala area of Kasur on a tip-off. Police sources told that Abid Ali had contacted his relatives two days ago. The arrested persons have been shifted to Lahore for further investigation.",['News Desk'],"LAHORE: Punjab Information Minister Fayyazul Hassan Chohan on Thursday announced that the Motorway gang-rape victim has identified both perpetrators of the crime.

ISLAMABAD: A top Pakistani bank's employee who was caught on video groping a woman has been arrested and fired from his workplace, Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari confirmed on Sunday in an update to the Islamabad bank harassment case.



Mazari's tweet came a few hours after a video went viral on social media wherein a man, identified as Usman Gohar and likely in his mid-30s, was caught red-handed on video sexually harassing a woman, groping her as she stood by his desk, and then taking his seat as if nothing happened.



Noting that the deputy commissioner of Islamabad, Muhammed Hamza Shafqaat, informed her of the bank employee's arrest, the minister lauded the federal capital's authorities, including the administration and the police, for ""quick action"".

Shireen Mazari also shared a picture of the man, with his face blurred and posing alongside a police officer after his arrest.

Prior to the federal minister's post, DC Shafqaat had said Usman Gohar ""cannot be hired by any other bank"" as per the regulations of the State Bank of Pakistan.

""Police raided his house. The culprit has turned his cell off and his hiding for the last 3 hours. One special team is searching for him,"" he had added.



Following the arrest, the deputy inspector-general (DIG) of police for operations had noted that ""further legal action [was] being taken"".

Faysal Bank, too, issued a statement, saying Usman Gohar ""has been terminated effective immediately"" but stressed that though an employee, he was not a branch manager.

""Faysal Bank strongly condemns such individual act of unprofessional behavior and #workplaceharassment by an employee, which is contrary to the strong value system, ethical standards and professional work environment being maintained by the Bank for all its employees,"" it said.

Workplace harassment

Earlier, on Saturday, a video had gone viral on the Internet showing the incident of sexual harassment; it was viewed tens of thousands of times on Twitter.

Workplace harassment is quite common in Pakistan despite the government introducing the Protection against Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2010, with the aim to ""create a safe working environment for women, which is free from harassment, abuse and intimidation to facilitate their right to work with dignity"".

While the law ""is not only restricted to workplaces [and] is applicable to all public spheres"", it has been criticised for being futile in informal sectors, such as entertainment, where a relationship between an employer and an employee is not defined or inked into a contract.

A UN Women blog post published in August 2020 stated that the Protection against Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2010, some ""236 inquiry committees have been notified in different government departments"" across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Many women who face sexual harassment choose not to come forward due to fear of their families’ reputation being tarnished or losing their jobs, with those hailing from lower socioeconomic background even less likely to report such incidents.

According to a research carried out by Pakistan's first anti-harassment awareness campaign, Stop Harassment Now, a whopping 96% of women said they or their colleagues faced some form of sexual harassment at workplace.

Social media reaction

Social media users also joined in the conversation on sexual harassment, offering various insights and sharing their own experiences as well.

""A man’s non-consensual touch suddenly makes you feel powerless & small,"" shared one user.



Another said this likely pointed to ""an identified pattern"" if a video was being recorded and needed ""to be put an end to"".



""Is someone going to take an action or not,"" asked another.

Some shared comments from what they claimed were ""rape apologist"".



And some others, following Shafqaat's request to take down the video, spoke of the hypocrisy among the masses in campaigning to take down videos of alleged sexual harassers and seemingly no action when women's compromising videos went viral.

SARGODHA: Police arrested a 22-year-old man for allegedly shooting his sister for 'honour' after she married for the sixth time.

Police had launched an investigation into the alleged murder of 30-year-old Nighat Parveen after her sixth husband, Waseem Amjad, filed a complaint on August 17 with police that his wife had been kidnapped.

Employing technological methods in the investigation, police were able to trace the last call made from Parveen’s mobile phone to her parents' house. When police grilled the victim's parents, they were told that she had gone to Islamabad with her friends.

Later, police started questioning Parveen’s 22-year-old brother Abdullah Hashim who allegedly confessed to murdering his sister during the investigation.

Abdullah allegedly told police that his sister had become “a source of disgrace” for his family for the past eight years. He added that people in the village had also started questioning the family's honour due to Parveen's ""character"".

Police say Hashim confessed that when Parveen returned to her parents' home after tying the knot for the sixth time, he shut her inside a room and shot her to death.

According to police, the victim's brother has been arrested and the weapon used to commit the crime has also been recovered. Police added that a case will be registered against the suspect and he will be presented in court soon.",[],"Police say victim's 22-year-old brother Abdullah Hashim allegedly confessed to murdering his sister during probe.

1986,999,1496,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/613978-child-protection,,Child protection,"Pakistan is faced with a burgeoning menace of child abuse amongst its ‘madressahs’, schools, domestic helpers, child labour and street children. Should there not be a more profound introspection of why we have failed and what must we do differently to protect our most vulnerable and precious resource?

What ought to be obvious by now should be the bitter realisation that some of the steps we have taken so far may appear good on paper, but except for consuming a lot of state resources have not added even an iota of protection to our children. The invisible National Commission on the Rights of Child and the ineffective Child Protection Departments could offer perfect examples of this tragedy. We also fail to realise that child abuse cannot be eliminated by foreign-funded NGOs or Unicef-funded helplines, SOPs, seminars and Child Protection Centres. Child protection calls for indigenous thinking and actions.

Pakistan has numerous child protection legislations. They are loaded with vague and conflicting requirements. They place no specific statutory child protection obligations on teachers, schools, ‘madrassas’, organisations or those who employ children for domestic or commercial work. This article suggests specific child protection measures which can be readily adopted by educational institutes on a voluntary basis and subsequently legislated as more experience is gained.

Each school and madressah must clearly state and prominently display – so as to be visible to all – its child protection policy. This could take the form of written statements such as: “All children have the right to a life free from physical and sexual abuse, neglect, and emotional maltreatment. If you think that someone is trying to abuse you or has abused you, you must immediately call phone (----) and also inform any member of the Child Protection Committee. If a teacher or staff knows that a child: (a) has been harmed; (b) is being harmed; or (c) is at risk of being harmed, it shall be mandatory for him / her to report the matter, as soon as practicable, at phone ( ----) and to any member of the Child Protection Committee. Our school / madressah commits to zero tolerance for any form of child abuse and shall provide all possible protection and support to every child.”

Every school and madressah should establish a ‘Child Protection Committee’ (CPC), consisting of three to five senior staff members and led by the head of the institution. This committee’s name and responsibilities must also be prominently displayed at locations accessible to all children. Any student, teacher, staff or parent can report an allegation or suspicion that a child has been or may have been abused or neglected to any member of the CPC. On receiving the report, the CPC will immediately meet, speak to the concerned child and where required establish contact with the area police and the child protection officer.

The CPC will have the responsibility of ensuring that procedures relating to abuse reporting, recording and investigating are established. It will ensure that a continuous liaison is maintained with the local police, hospital and child protection officer. It will train and sensitise teachers and staff on issues relating to child protection and to observe and recognise possible signs of abuse. It will remain in frequent contact with children and provide age-appropriate awareness on matters relating to child rights and child abuse. It will be for the CPC to create an environment of trust and support on one hand and checks and balances on the other.

The CPCs shall also develop a mechanism to ensure that cases of child abuse are handled with tact, sensitivity and trust. Also that the affected child receives medical, social and emotional support and that state agencies like the police, hospitals and child protection are duly involved.

Voluntary adoption and implementation of such child protection systems by a number of schools and madressahs could lead the way for future legislation that requires a mandatory requirement for establishing such systems in all educational institutes.

On September 21, a woman was sexually assaulted in her Raiwind house and a female patient was raped by a doctor in Gujranwala. A woman was raped in Muzaffargarh and another was raped by robbers in Depalpur. The IGP Punjab has taken notice of all the incidents. The accused involved in the Raiwind gang-rape incident, which took place before the Lahore motorway tragedy in September, have been arrested by the police a week ago. Rape and sexual violence have been under the spotlight in Punjab since the Lahore motorway gang rape that led to huge protests and demands to change the country's rape laws. The key rapist in this case, Abid Ali, is still at large. Abid’s arrest seems to take time as he has either stopped using his cell phone or has been given shelter by someone to produce him before the police at the appropriate time.

The month of September has produced frequent tragic incidents throughout Punjab, which have shaken the people to the core. Among these numerous crimes, the most barbarous ones were rape incidents which statistically have made it to the top of the crime list this month. The Lahore motorway gang-rape was an incident so savage that it forced people to feel dubious about the safety of their dignity as well, in addition to the uncertainties already frightening their minds regarding their lives and valuables. People, ordinary as well as influential, came out of their houses to direct the attention of the Punjab Police towards the safety of citizens, especially women.

The Lahore motorway gang-rape incident and the protest rallies in condemnation of it initially suggested that the police officials of the Punjab province would be more cautious than ever about the security of their people. But, it seems like this incident has paved the way for the immoral and impious devils of the society to commit their wicked acts. More rape incidents have made their way to newspaper headlines. Despite the fact that police officials are equipped with the latest electronic gadgets and forensic facilities, it has been observed that today the citizens are paying the price of police negligence, more than ever before. It has been two weeks since the gang rape incident and the police have been unable to catch the key culprit, Abid. Initially, a handful of police teams and cops of a few districts were looking for the wrongdoer, but now all 36 districts’ police officials have been ordered to search for him; hence drawing a picture of Abid in equivalence with the Indian movie “Don”, for whom the cops of 11 countries turned the world upside down.

Despite many promises and claims by the Punjab Police, the crime rate has only been experiencing unending thrust with every passing day; especially the rape incidents. At a time when the city is being reigned over by chaos and lawlessness, the officials of the Punjab Police seem to be eating corruption with their daily bread, and drinking lies with their daily water.",['Salman Aslam'],"LAHORE:The Punjab Police have witnessed a sharp increase in rape incidents across the province during the month of September.

1794,807,1203,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/711973-reduced-crowds-unlikely-to-lower-covid-spread-risk,,Reduced crowds ‘unlikely to lower Covid spread risk’,"LONDON: Academics have warned reopening stadia with reduced crowd numbers is unlikely to lower the risk of spreading Covid-19.

Researchers at the University of Reading claim without effective social distancing measures for fans before, during and after matches, rates of transmission will most probably not fall. Analysis of the number of coronavirus cases and deaths following matches played in England’s top eight divisions in the weeks prior to the 2019/20 season’s suspension showed links to higher Covid-19 cases and deaths in the local area.

The study found there were on average around six additional cases, two additional deaths, and three additional excess deaths per match per 100,000 people in the areas the games were played, with similar increases in the areas the away teams came from.

This increase was no lower after matches with low attendances than those with capacity crowds. “Our study backs up the view that reducing crowd sizes on its own is unlikely to lower the risk of spreading of the virus,” said professor James Reade, a sports economist at the University of Reading and lead author of the study.

“Even when stadiums are only partially filled, fans tend to pack together in groups. They also mix in bar areas, toilets, and queues, as well as in pubs, shops and restaurants outside the grounds. “This behaviour presents an effective route for airborne viruses to spread and is no less prevalent with smaller crowds.

“It must be noted that our findings linking cases and matches offer only observational evidence regarding the infection risk in under-capacity stadiums.

“While it is difficult to compare data before and after lockdown – as people’s behaviour and rules have changed on transport and in shops, for example – our findings do suggest pilot events will be essential to planning for the safe return of crowds to sporting events.”

The study evaluated matches played in February and March 2020 and their effect on deaths and excess deaths in April 2020 and found matches in March had a larger impact on Covid-19 cases and deaths in the areas of both the home and away teams as the virus became more widespread.",[],"LONDON: Academics have warned reopening stadia with reduced crowd numbers is unlikely to lower the risk of spreading Covid-19.

It has been learnt that so far three teachers and four students have been tested positive. Teachers and students have expressed lots of reservations about the downplaying of threats by the management as it is trying to hide the cases.

Students and teachers are using the same transport, thus raising the concerns of contracting virus from each other. A couple of students from Cambridge section have been infected. While that section has gone online with students asked to attend classes through zoom, the siblings of infected students in primary section have been allowed to attend classes in college, raising concerns among parents of other students and teachers.

While students are coming on alternate days to attend the classes, the principal has increased the working hours of the college employees, putting them at the high risk.

Contrary to this, most of the educational institutions of Islamabad are taking live classes for 4 days with 2 days online classes in order to give its employees a relief in the present circumstances.

1060,73,119,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/683583-trump-s-war,,Trump’s war,"President Donald Trump chose a national holiday traditionally intended for joy and unity to deliver dark, combative harangues against a “radical ideology” that is no more than “violent mayhem” designed to overthrow law and order.

In speeches at Mount Rushmore on Friday evening and on the South Lawn of the White House Saturday to commemorate America’s 244th birthday, Trump minced no words and stayed true to form in appealing to his conservative and white supremacist base by making clear he was taking sides in a burgeoning culture war between honoring a past scarred with racism and civil war and a “new far-left fascism” that seeks a future of social justice free of inequality. He couldn’t have been more divisive.

“Their goal is not a better America. Their goal is the end of America,” he said of demonstrators demanding social justice reforms of police departments nationwide, among them the Black Lives Matter movement.

Trump appealed to his few thousand admirers Friday in an amphitheater beneath the carved busts of four presidents in the Black Hills of South Dakota to honor the monuments and statues saluting America’s past, shunning the fervor of the present in which millions of Americans have marched for their country to bring alive the ideals invoked in sacred documents that have guided American jurisprudence and for which Americans have died from the green fields of Lexington and Concord to the bloodied sands of Iraq and Afghanistan.

“The radical ideology attacking our country advances under the banner of social justice,” Trump said. “But in truth, it would abolish both justice and society. It would transform justice into an instrument of division and vengeance and turn our free society into a place of repression, domination and exclusion. They want to silence us, but we will not be silenced.”

That’s most of what Trump has been doing for 3.5 years.

He is seeking reelection against a growing tide of what Trump branded a “left-wing cultural revolution” that has toppled statues of Confederate generals, slave owners and even of Columbus in a quest for recognition of the need for racial justice. He condemned a social movement that since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis May 25 has pushed for an end to police brutality against Blacks and other minorities.

Most of the demonstrations have been peaceful but Trump inflated their impact, making it sound as if protesters were rampaging through cities on a wave of destruction that he characterized as “violent mayhem.”

“Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values and indoctrinate our children,” he told the crowd in which few wore masks or practiced social distancing. “Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders, deface our most sacred memorials and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities.”

Trump recently signed an executive order to punish people who destroy monuments on federal property.

His racism is well known by now, from his saying there are “very fine people on both sides” at the white supremacist demonstration in Charlottesville in 2017 in which one woman was killed to his condemnation of

Black football players for kneeling during the national anthem that cost one his career.

But the protests for change may be inspiring Americans more than Trump and his fellow Republicans may realize, creating more of a backlash to the president’s policies, including his refusal to take charge of the pandemic, leaving it to governors and mayors, and calling on the military to suppress demonstrations in Washington, DC, and elsewhere.

Civics Analytics, a data company whose clients include Democratic campaigns, released four recent polls that indicate between 15 million to 26 million Americans have participated in demonstrations over Floyd’s killing, The New York Times reported Saturday. Further, 500,000 people staged protests in nearly 550 locations countrywide on June 6.

They demanded that Lahore Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Umar Sheikh be sacked for blaming the victim.

Men, women and children gathered outside the Karachi Press Club for the demonstration that was jointly organised by Women Democratic Front, Women’s Action Forum, Besharam Baaghi Tehreek, Tehrik-e-Niswan, Siaasi Aurtain, Aurat March and Inter-University Feminist Union.

The protesters demanded an end to all violence against women. “We demand swift justice for all the victims of sexual violence, but we oppose capital punishment and violence begetting violence,” said Qurat Mirza, one of the protest organisers. “These knee-jerk reactions only cause derailment from the patriarchal roots of the issue.” The protesters also released a charter of demands, which calls for increasing government spending on women’s health, education and safety, making all public spaces safe for women and introducing a gender-sensitive curriculum. They demanded the implementation of the legislation relating to criminal offences such as rape and to the protection of transgendered persons.

They called for the criminal justice system to conduct effective and transparent investigations into gender-based crimes and to hold fair and expeditious trials, starting with implementing the relevant pieces of legislation such as the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Offences Relating to Rape) Act and the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act.

The protesters demanded banning the two-finger test and providing additional resources and specialised training for first information reporting, medical examination, counselling, investigation and prosecution of sexual violence crimes.

They called for establishing gender-based violence reporting cells at all police stations across Sindh led by women police officers with specialised training, increasing funding for the existing Darul Amans and other shelters, and increasing the number of functional shelters. The protesters demanded that the quality of crisis and shelter services be improved through adopting policies that are fully consistent with the freedom of movement of the survivors.

Another protest: Home-Based Women Workers Federation (HBWWF), National Trade Union Alliance and Shehri Awami Mahaz also held a major joint protest in front of the press club to voice their concerns about the growing incidents of rape, torture and murder of women and girls. The protesters said that the increasing instances of violence against women, children and transgender persons showed the rising tendencies of violence, intolerance and sexual frustration in society.

They said that the horrific gang rape on the Lahore-Sialkot motorway and the very negative statement of the Lahore CCPO depicts the reactionary thinking that was introduced in our society by the dictator Gen Ziaul Haq.

They also said that today a girl playing in the street, a boy going to the madrasa, female students of schools and colleges, and women at workplaces are not safe from sexual violence. Even the dead bodies of women are not safe from this menace, they lamented.

They claimed that the government is promoting the narrative that the real place of the female members of society is inside their homes. “They are not considered equal citizens. However, even inside the four walls of their homes, women and girls are not safe from violence,” said HBWWF’s Zehra Khan. “When women demand equal rights, they face opposition on the basis of religion and on the basis of morality, while their struggle is termed a tool of propaganda of the West.”",['Our Correspondent'],"They demanded that Lahore Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Umar Sheikh be sacked for blaming the victim.

A video has been making rounds on social media showing Indian dancer Terence Lewis allegedly touching Nora Fatehi.

While many bashed Lewis for harassing the actor, she has finally stepped forth to clear the air and break her silence on the allegations placed against Lewis.

Lewis responded to the entire debacle with a story on his Instagram post about a Zen master.

“A Zen Master and his disciples of monks were walking in the Himalayas back to their monastery. On their way to the monastery they had to cross the river Ganga flowing fully though less violently,” he wrote alongside a photo of him holding the actor.

“There was a young beautiful maiden in distress, sitting close to the banks, whose village was just across the river. She was scared to cross the river by herself so she asked the elder monk to help her cross the river,” Lewis added.

“‘Sure’ said the Zen Master and held her up in his arms. They crossed the river and he let her down gently as she went to her village after thanking the Master. The younger monk wasn't taking this all easily. He looked little worried,” he wrote further.

“The monks came to their monastery after couple of hours of difficult walk in the hills, but the younger monk was still not settled.”

“Sensing it the Guru asked him what the matter was. The young monk said ‘Master, we have sworn of not touching a woman, but you carried her in your arms, you tell us not to think of women but you touched her’ complained the disciple.”

""The Zen Master smiled n replied ‘I carried her across the river and left her on the other side. Are You Still Carrying Her?’” he wrote as he ended the story.

Before signing off, Lewis thanked Fatehi, saying: “Thank you @norafatehi for being the most elegant, dignified n classy guest judge & for your implicit trust in me!”



Dropping a comment underneath the post, Nora wrote: “Thank you Terrence! In today’s time of social media video morphing and photoshop effects for meme purposes.. I’m glad you have not let it bother you and you have remained poised and dignified!”

“This too shall pass you and Geeta ma’am have been so respectful with me and have made me feel so loved and accepted as a judge on the show, its been a great life learning experience! Stay blessed,” she added.",[],"Nora Fatehi breaks silence as Terence Lewis gets accused of sexually harassing herA video has been making rounds on social media showing Indian dancer Terence Lewis allegedly touching Nora Fatehi.

Arzoo Masih, 13, is said to have married a Muslim man, Syed Ali Azhar, 44, after converting to Islam. Police have arrested Azhar’s brothers, Syed Shariq Ali and Syed Mohsin Ali, and his friend Danish over their alleged involvement in the abduction and forced conversion.

On Thursday, the suspects moved their post-arrest bail applications before District South’s additional district and sessions judge Faiza Khalil, contending that they were innocent. Their attorney, Hidayat Ali Leghari, argued that the girl had already recorded her statement before the Sindh High Court, stating that she had accepted Islam out of her free will and had married Azhar without any fear or pressure.

He added that in view of the girl’s statement, the SHC had restrained the police from arresting Azhar and his family members. He asked the court to grant bail to his clients, all policemen. The judge, after listening to the arguments from the prosecutor as well, approved the bail applications and ordered the accused to submit sureties of Rs50,000 each with the court to secure their release.

According to the FIR, lodged by the girl’s father, Raja, Arzoo went missing on October 13 after which he approached the police to find her. Later, it transpired that she was in the custody of the suspects. The case was registered under section 364-A (kidnapping or abducting a person under the (age of fourteen) of the PPC at the Frere police station.

Earlier this week, a large number of Christian community members and civil society activists gathered outside the Karachi Press Club to protest against the incident, demanding of the government to make a law against the growing practice targeting religious minority girls.

They claimed that Arzoo was kidnapped and forced to marry her Muslim abductor in an area within the jurisdiction of the Frere police station. “We have proper evidence from Nadra that Arzoo is a 13-year-old who has been forced to be married to a 44-year-old man,” said Anthony Naveed, a minority MPA and leader of the PPP, who also attended the protest. The Sindh Assembly had passed the act in 2014, according to which the minimum age of marriage is 18 years and making a person younger than that age marry is a punishable offense.",['Our Correspondent'],"A court on Thursday granted bail to three men accused of abducting a teenage Christian girl and then forcibly converting her to Islam.

Informed sources said that the intelligence agencies had the information that the terrorist may attack certain targets in Karachi. Intelligence alerts were also issued one of which had clearly identified Pakistan Stock Exchange as the possible target of the terrorists. Following these reports, the Karachi police beefed up the PSX’s security and deployed a team of its commandos. The private security of the Pakistan Stock Exchange was also enhanced.

Karachi police sources said that in view of this preparedness when the Indian sponsored BLA attacked the Pakistan Stock Exchange building, they were quickly countered and killed.

The bill further to amend the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 [The Criminal Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2020 (Insertion of new Section 297A)] was moved by PML-N Senator Muhammad Javed Abbasi, which was not opposed by the government on a private members day.

He explained that harshest punishment was imperative for curbing the diabolical act of taking out dead bodies from graves and subjecting them to sexual crime. Likewise, another bill, introduced by JI Senator Sirajul Haq, was tabled in the House and referred to the committee concerned of the House.

The proposed bill seeks to amend Article 93 of the Constitution to make it mandatory on advisors to also take oath like ministers. The JI senator said the proposed amendment would make it binding on an advisor to be held answerable before the Parliament.

He moved another bill to amend the Zainab Alert Law to also make the police officer or any other involved in probing a child rape or murder case seen to be showing negligence. It was also referred to the House committee concerned.

State Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan said a draft bill was brought in the Cabinet, which was sent to the Ministry of Law, which made the state petitioner in a rape or molestation case.

The Senate was moved to enable the Senate Chairman and NA Speaker to chip in and decide on appointment of chief election commissioner and members of the Election Commission of Pakistan if the prime minister and leader of opposition and the parliamentary committee remain inconclusive on their nominations. The bill was introduced by Sirajul Haq.

JI Senator Mushtaq Ahmad moved a bill for amending the Anti-Terrorism Act to ensure that in case of legislation relating to FATF, money laundering and terror financing, foreign pressure must not be accepted, natural justice be ensured and national interests protected.

The bill was opposed by the government but Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani referred it to the House committee concerned after taking sense of the House. The House passed an amendment to the Pakistan Press Council Ordinance, opening doors on others, lawyers and journalists to be candidates for the post of PPC chairman. Previously, only a retired judge of the Supreme Court could head it.

The bill was brought by Senator Javed Abbasi and approved by the House panel concerned. Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Senator Shibli Faraz charged the opposition had made a blatant constitutional violation during the PDM pubic meeting in Quetta, of which PPP was also a component. However, he was met with sloganeering by some opposition senators as he tried to respond to the PPP parliamentary leader in the Senate Sherry Rehman and Senator Mian Raza Rabbani’s strong objection to further empowering the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority through an amendment bill, moved by PTI Senator Faisal Javed, who also heads the House standing committee concerned.

Senators Sherry and Rabbani questioned the logic behind empowering the Pemra more, which amounted to allowing it to get into private entities in the name of job security of media persons.",['Mumtaz Alvi'],"ISLAMABAD: A bill proposing death sentence or at least life imprisonment to anyone abusing a dead body was moved in the Senate on Monday and referred to the House standing committee concerned for deliberation and report.

PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Friday reprimanded the federal government and claimed that it ""loved"" quoting the Human Rights Watch (HRW) on the Kashmir issue but not on the country's internal human rights abuses.

The PPP leader’s statement came in light of the recent report of the Human Rights Watch on human rights abuses allegedly being carried out by the National Accountability Bureau.

“Human rights watch calls out NAB political victimisation of political parties & media. Mentions Saad Rafique, Mir Shakeel-ur-Rehman, myself & my father. We love to quote @hrw on Kashmir but ignore them on Pakistan,” he wrote on Twitter.



HRW asks Pakistan to stop NAB abuses

Earlier, the HRW had urged the Pakistani authorities to stop using NAB —referring to it as ""a dictatorship-era body, possessing draconian and arbitrary powers"" — to harass and intimidate opponents.

In a statement, the rights organisation said that the government should follow up on the 87-page detailed verdict of the Supreme Court of Pakistan on the Khawaja brothers case to rein in the anti-graft body.

""The court granted the men bail and criticised the NAB for showing 'utter disregard to the law, fair play, equity and propriety,' ruling that the 'case was a classic example of trampling of fundamental rights [and] unlawful deprivation of freedom',"" read a statement from the HRW.

Pakistan’s parliament should carry out urgent reforms to make the anti-corruption body independent, the Human Rights Watch said.

""In its decision, the Supreme Court also expressed concern about the use of the NAB as an instrument to target government opponents,"" read the statement by the HRW. ""The court cited a February report by the European Commission that criticized the NAB for bias, noting that 'very few cases of the ruling party ministers and politicians have been pursued since the 2018 elections, which is considered to be a reflection of NAB's partiality,'"" it added.

HRW on MSR

The HRW mentioned the illegal arrest and detention of veteran journalist Mir Shakil-ur-Rehman by NAB, who is in the anti-graft body's custody since March.

""The National Accountability Bureau arrested Mir Shakil-ur-Rehman, editor-in-chief of the Jang group, the largest media group in Pakistan, in Lahore on March 12 on charges relating to a 34-year-old property transaction. He has remained in the agency’s custody ever since,"" said the human rights organisation.

The international NGO spoke of former president Asif Ali Zardari, who had to appear in person after the anti-graft body denied his request to record a statement through a video link because of his ill-health and the prevalent COVID-19 situation in the country.

""Zardari previously spent 11 years in prison – more than half in NAB custody – without a conviction,"" it said.",[],"Bilawal’s statement came in light of the recent report of the Human Rights Watch on human rights abuses allegedly being carried out by NAB.

1138,151,250,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/609174-karachi-police-revamping-emergency-response-mechanism,,Karachi police ‘revamping emergency response mechanism’,"The Karachi police is revamping the emergency response mechanism on modern international standards. A dedicated deputy inspector general (DIG) is now operations in charge of Madadgar Command Control (MCC-15) and associated services.

Talking to The News on Tuesday, DIG Maqsood Memon, head of the security units of the Karachi police, including the MCC 15, said that the Security and Emergency Division comprises various police units working together to strengthen the MCC 15.

The revamped MCC 15 will ensure first responders to all calls, hot pursuit of criminals, prevention of street crime, surveillance of anti-social elements, snap checking, information gathering, public facilitation and help, SOS alerts and coordination with emergency services.

DIG Memon said the MCC 15 now responds to any situation within nine minutes, whereas the earlier response time was 30 minutes. The force would be equipped with modern gadgets, including mobile tablets, security cameras, and wireless communication and trackers.

The force will have access to the identity verification system (IVS) to check the genuineness of the CNIC, to the vehicle verification system (VVS) to identify unregistered and stolen vehicles and motorcycles, to the criminal record verification (CRV) to check the criminal history of a person, incident tagging to capture details of any incident, surveillance of persons released from jails, the tenants information system (TIS) and traffic management etc.

DIG Memon said a proper monitoring mechanism would be in place by establishing a separate command desk at command and control centre to monitor the activities of the force. The location and movement of each patrol vehicle would be recorded, live-streaming of the all response vehicles would be monitored and recorded, snap checking would be recorded and instructions would be communicated from the command desk, he added.

Describing the MCC 15 improvements, he said they have made some major improvements so far without incurring any additional expenditure. After the establishment of the Security and Emergency Service Division Karachi, he added, the following improvements have been made in MCC 15: the strength of emergency services have been increased from 1,100 police personnel to 2,200 personnel; previously, 106 police mobiles were deployed for 15 emergency services, but now 40 and 30 additional vehicles from the SSU and the Muhafiz Force respectively are being utilised for emergency calls; additional personnel of the SSU had been deployed at Madadgar Call Centre; seven deployment centres have been established in each district of the Karachi Range, wherefrom all fleet and ground staff will be dispatched for duty in order to give a quick response; and two DSPs in two shifts are deployed in each zone for the supervision and monitoring of the deployment centres.

He added that a biometric attendance system has been installed at every deployment centre for proper monitoring and supervision of manpower, KOT is established at every deployment centre, third shift has started for better performance, 15 emergency mobiles are working around the clock, and the deployed strength of emergency services is facilitated with accommodation at four places (CTD Building PTC Saeedabad, Chowkandi Base, Headquarters Khawaja Ajmair Nagri and Garden Headquarters Karachi).

The DIG security said the strength of IT staff had been increased to seven from one at old 15. Only two PRIs were working at 15 emergency call centre, but now one new PRI had been added and there were now three PRIs working, he added.

District-wise dispatchers have been increased from five to seven and now every district has a separate dispatch, and the staffers of telecommunication and wireless sets have also been increased. Chairs for call agents were insufficient; therefore, 80 new chairs have been provided to 15 emergency call centre and service level has increased from to 98 per cent.

DIG Memon stated that the revamping of the MCC 15 included call recording, a listening and feedback system had been acquired for quality improvement, and the fuel limit of Madadgar 15 vehicles had been increased from 10 liters to 15 liters per day.

Apart from that, he said that to further improve the capabilities of the personnel of the newly formed division of the Sindh Police he had requested the Sindh inspector general of police for emergency services response training.

He shared that the Sindh police had formed a new division, namely Police Security and Emergency Services

Division, headed by the DIG Security and Emergency Services Division, Karachi, and the main objective was to streamline the security deployment adn emergency response to ensure a safe and secure environment in the city.

The newly established division has started functioning to cater to emergency response needs with the available resources. In order to further improve the police emergency response and security, it is essential to equip and train the personnel as per the set international standard to respond rapidly in emergency situations, he added.

This newly formed division of the Sindh police would like to get 400 personnel of the Security and Emergency Services Division trained for emergency response services, emergency call operators, surveillance operators and dispatch officers’ tasks of emergency response services (Dolphin Force) by the Punjab Police and Punjab Safe Cities Authorities in the first phase.

He added that it has been requested that a focal person be nominated for coordination and assistance to initiate the above training programme in order to provide a safe and secure environment to the citizens of Karachi.",['Salis Bin Perwaiz'],"The Karachi police is revamping the emergency response mechanism on modern international standards.

The post-mortem report has found that a bullet was fired at her from a close range and police have written a letter to the authorities concerned for verification of the pistol used in the incident on Thursday.

Police say the investigations are at a preliminary level. “Nothing could be said exactly. It is yet to be ascertained if it was a murder or a suicide,” says Gizri SHO Pervez Methani. According to the investigators, the post-mortem report found that a bullet was fired from a close range. The officer said a Brazil-made 9mm pistol was used and police had sent the bullet and the spent casing for forensic examination and ballistics cross-matching.

Police have also approached the South deputy commissioner for the verification of the pistol. Police said a case would be registered if it was confirmed that the woman was murdered.

Though the deceased’s family has refused to initiate any legal proceedings into the matter, police on Thursday went to the victim’s hometown Mirpurkhas, where the deceased was laid to rest, to record the statements of the family members and relatives. The victim was the daughter of the custodian of a saint’s shrine famous as Girhori Sharif in Mirpurkhas.

SHO Methani said police had examined the cell phone records of the deceased and were questioning her friends. “The main challenge for us is to find out from where the deceased got a weapon,” says the officer.

Late Tuesday night, Syeda Maha was found dead in the Defence Housing Authority after reportedly developing differences with her father. The family in their initial statement had told police Maha locked herself in the washroom and committed suicide by shooting. She was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre with critical injury to head. Doctors said her brain cells were damaged in the incident as the bullet pierced through her head.

According to police, the victim was unmarried and recently rented a house in the Defence area. She hailed from Mirpurkhas and was living with her parents and younger siblings – two sisters and a brother. She was said to have had a verbal fight with her father before her death.",['Faraz Khan'],"It is yet to be ascertained if it was a murder or a suicide,” says Gizri SHO Pervez Methani.

The feud between American blogger Cynthia D. Ritchie and PPP took a serious turn on Friday when Ritchie accused party leaders of ""rape"" and ""harassment"" in a Facebook video broadcast live.



Ritchie, who is based in Pakistan, alleged that one of the party's senior members had raped her while two others had ""manhandled"" her at a separate occasion.

She stated that the incidents occurred in 2011 when the PPP was in power, and when the individual she accused of rape had been a senior minister. Geo News has attempted to reach out to the accused for comment but received no response so far.

Ritchie further alleged that two other senior party leaders — a federal minister and former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gillani (who has publicly responded to the allegation) — had ""physically manhandled"" her when the latter ""was staying the President House"".

In a subsequent textual post on Facebook, Ritchie said that the alleged rape incident had occurred at the accused's residence in Islamabad's Minister's Enclave in 2011, ""around the [time of the] OBL (Osama Bin Laden) incident"".

""I thought it was a meeting about my visa but I was given flowers [and] a drugged drink,"" she claimed, adding that she had ""kept quiet"" about the incident because ""who in the [ruling government] would help me against the [accused minister]?""

However, she said she did tell someone about the incident at the US Embassy in 2011, but ""due to 'fluid' situation and 'complex' relations"" between Washington and Islamabad, she said the response ""was less than adequate"".

Gillani responds

Responding to the allegations against him, former premier Gilani asked: ""Can a prime minister ever commit such an act at the Aiwan-e-Sadr?""

""What was the lady levelling such accusations doing at the Aiwan-e-Sadr?"" he continued, adding: ""Who gave her the right to accuse politicians like this?""

He said responding to such statements would be ""contemptuous"".

Gillani said that he may have gone to the Aiwan-e-Sadr to meet the president or a delegation.

The former prime minister said that Ritchie ""should be ashamed of herself for saying such things"".

He noted that Ritchie had recently levelled several accusations at former Pakistani prime minister and late party leader Benazir Bhutto and ""no one can tolerate such accusations"".

""I am not worried about what was said about me. I am more concerned about the baseless accusations levelled at Shaheed Benazir.""

""Ali Haider Gillani and Ali Qasim have approached the court in this regard,"" he said.

Later, in a conversation with Geo News, the former premier said that he had met Ritchie a while back at a diplomat's residence and had met her subsequently on various occasions in large gatherings.

""I am not aware of her background. She contacted my son Ali Qadir Gillani a while back. She told my son his father is an honourable man and he should inquire after me on her behalf.""

PPP moves FIA against Ritchie over 'slanderous' remarks

Earlier, the PPP had requested the Federal Investigation Agency's (FIA) Cybercrime Wing to take immediate action and initiate proceedings against Cynthia D. Ritchie for ""extremely derogatory and slanderous remarks"" regarding Benazir Bhutto.

""Through this application, it is brought to your notice that a woman, who goes by the name of Cynthia D Ritchie on Twitter has passed extremely derogatory and slanderous remarks about Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, through her Twitter handle/account,"" the letter dated May 28 read.

""Her remarks being false, untrue, defamating and slanderous as they are, have caused immense pain and agony to the millions across Pakistan who revere and hold Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto in high esteem,"" it said.

""Your office is requested to take immediate action and initiate proceedings against this woman as prescribed by the law and under your mandate. A photocopy of the tweet, a true portrayal of her sick and disgusting mind is attached with the application,"" the letter added.",[],"American blogger Cynthia Dawn Ritchie, who is currently based in Pakistan, made startling allegations against senior PPP leaders in a Facebook live video while addressing cyber harassment targeted at her.

These views were expressed by the officials of police department participating in a two-day capacity building workshop with police personnel on ending violence against women (EVAW) organised by Individualland Pakistan with support from UN Women.

The initiative is part of UN Women’s project on “Ending Violence against Women (EVAW) through Access to Justice, Services and Safe Public Spaces in Pakistan” supported by the US Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL).

One of the significant components of this project is capacity building of police personnel from five districts in three provinces of Pakistan, Khairpur, Dadu, Karachi, Quetta and Rawalpindi on understanding issues related to gender-based violence and handling survivors of violence.

The training workshop, moderated by Mushoud Ali and Sundas Syeda on behalf of Individualland Pakistan, began with a discussion on dissecting power dynamics in which the term power was deconstructed and types of power were also discussed. The constitutional and legal framework of Pakistan was also shared with the participants. The social, economic and psychological impacts of violence were discussed as well as types of violence which include structural violence, cultural violence, physical violence, and economical violence came under discussion.

A key element covered was how the police can support survivors of violence as first responders, and play a critical role in ensuring access to justice. It was agreed that many mistakes that happen in the judicial process occur due to the negligence, lack of support or weak understanding and categorization of the forms of violence which impede the correct enforcement of legal articles.

The first component of this initiative was the development of a Police Training Manual through needs assessment, literature review as well as a consultative process engaging duty-bearers and stakeholders from the three provinces. In the second phase, trainings were commenced in Khairpur in October 2019 and are continuing in the five project districts till February 2020 with the objective to train 700 police officers. A total of five batches are being trained in each district engaging senior, mid-level and junior police officers.",['Our Correspondent'],"Islamabad : Understanding of law enforcement agencies about the dynamics of violence against women (VAW) is the key to end such violence from the society.

1984,997,1493,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/713235-motorway-rape-incident-public-fury-at-lahore-ccpo-remarks,,Motorway rape incident: Public fury at Lahore CCPO remarks,"ISLAMABAD: Lahore Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Umar Shaikh, who has been tasked to probe the rape of a woman on the Motorway, has started his investigation by questioning the choices of the woman, saying she should have taken a different route – a less deserted one – and checked her petrol tank before embarking on her journey.

The CCPO noted that the affected family departed Defence area of Lahore after midnight and took the Motorway route instead of GT Road, that too without adequate fuel. “The woman called her brother instead of police and her brother telephoned the Motorway Police at 1:30am to send a police mobile,” the CCPO said while talking to a private news channel.

Shaikh maintained the victim should have checked the fuel in her car beforetravelling as there is no petrol station on the Motorway. “There are three villages within the five kilometre radius of the incident spot. The suspects broke the glass window of the victim’s car. Blood samples have been taken from the glass. Latest technology of rural and urban police is being used in the investigation,” he said.

The statement of the CCPO drew sharp criticism from various circles, particularly from opposition leaders, and demand for his resignation #RemoveCCPOLahore has become top trend on Twitter.

Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shahbaz Sharif vowed to stand with the family ""till justice is served"". Condemning the incident, he said that the assault of a woman travelling with her children on the motorway is highly reprehensible, shameful and regrettable.

“This is a matter of national embarrassment and evidence of a completely broken down legal system,” the PM-N president said. He urged the government to investigate the case using quality investigative techniques like the ones used in the Zainab case so that the culprit is not let off the hook at the time of prosecution.

Shahbaz asked whose ""incompetence"" can be blamed for the motorway — which was always considered safe to travel — to have become a threat to safety. ""Law enforcement agencies must work together to apprehend those responsible and serve justice to the affected family so that the public's confidence in the government can be restored in some small measure,"" he said.

The PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb said the motorway incident was devastating as it is. “And to add to this, the CCPO's remarks are a moment of utter shame, disgrace and horror that someone who holds such views is responsible for the safety, security and dignity of our lives and property.”

Parliamentary Leader of the PPP in the Senate Sherry Rehman has submitted a call attention notice in the Senate Secretariat on the motorway rape incident. In her calling notice, she termed it as a heinous crime and the concerned ministry should reply before the Senate on it.

Sherry Rehman, while through his tweet, stated that she was shocked, frankly furious to hear some police officials have had the nerve to ask why the lady was out at that hour. “Too much as instead of doing their job of protecting citizens they are asking why women are driving or waiting for help on the motorway. They need to be dismissed,” she tweeted.

Adviser to the Prime Minister on Accountability, Shahzad Akbar admitted the government's ""administrative failure"" in the Lahore Motorway rape case, vowing that culprits would be arrested at all costs.

""There is some administrative failure [in the case] that we must admit since it took place on the link road that connects the two motorways,"" Akbar told a news conference. ""I see an unneeded controversy was created out of the CCPO's earlier statement,"" said Akbar. ""I have spoken to him about it, he will tell you himself what he meant by it.""

The prime minister's aide said that it was the government's responsibility to ensure that roads, motorways, streets and highways were safe for men and women to travel. ""If a case such as this takes place, it is also the government's job to arrest the culprits and make an example out of them,"" he said.

He also urged the media to keep the identity of the victim a secret even if they find out about it. The PPP Secretary Information Dr Nafisa Shah demanded the resignation of Minister of Communication Murad Saeed and Chief Minister Punjab Usman Buzdar over the incident of gang rape of woman on Lahore motorway. “The communication minister and chief minister should resign while accepting their incompetence,” she said.

Nafisa said it was tragic incident and all those involved in heinous crime should be brought before the law of land. Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari criticised the CCPO for blaming the victim.

“For an officer to effectively blame a woman for being gang raped by saying she should have taken the GT Road or question as to why she went out in the night with her children in unacceptable,” said Mazari in a tweet. “Nothing can ever rationalise the crime of rape.”

Minister for Planning, Development, Reforms, and Special Initiatives Asad Umar said that providing safety to the masses was the state's responsibility. Talking about the CCPO's statement, he said that he did not agree with the statement the police officer made. He said the statement was irresponsible and unnecessary, though there was nothing illegal in it. ""What action should we take against the CCPO? That he did not make a good statement?"" he asked, over calls for the CCPO's removal.

Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan expressed anger over the statement of the CCPO Lahore and asked him to leave his job if he cannot protect the citizens. In a video statement, Ali Muhammad Khan said the CCPO must be ashamed of his statement regarding the rape case. He said the CCPO is a highly responsible position and he cannot be allowed to pass such irresponsible remarks. He said it is the responsibility of state to protect its citizens no matter what time they choose to come out of their houses. He said the CCPO must step down if he cannot perform his duty.",['News Report'],"The PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb said the motorway incident was devastating as it is.

1057,70,114,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/643483-covid-19-and-child-abuse,,Covid-19 and child abuse,"The world has suffered through epidemics and pandemics in the past. Experience tells us that child abuse and neglect increase during such periods.

Apart from increasing mortality and morbidity all over the world, the Covid-19 pandemic will cause mental health problems in some children and will hit hard on children prone to abuse. It is a known fact that children are more vulnerable than adults to suffer heightened emotional distress when their routine life is disrupted by such events. Every child’s reaction is different. Some may show obvious signs of fear and anxiety; others may present as if nothing is happening.

The stress may manifest in them as aggression or reclusion. It is important to understand and validate their feelings. As adults, we sometimes ignore the fact that our children are living in the same environment as us and are trying to decipher the gravity of the situation as best as they can.

Parents and caregivers need to remember that children are good observers – your reaction to stress is their best tool to assess the situation. It is normal for anxiety and stress to develop in an adult when there is uncertainty about the future, but it is abnormal when one is unable to contain it. This may lead to violent behaviour towards children, who are, in general, the most susceptible targets.

We also know that more than 80 percent of the time perpetrators of sexual abuse are someone known to the child. During lockdown, children are home 24 hours or, in the circumstances of a parent contracting an illness, may be sent to relatives and acquaintances, making them even more vulnerable to sexual abuse. Particularly at risk are children who have undergone previous trauma, have mental or physical health problems, have parents who have mental health problems or are at high-risk of emotional disturbance because of current medical, financial and social conditions.

This pandemic is going to significantly affect children’s safety in the country unless we prepare for it and spread awareness at the same level as we are doing for hand washing, social distancing and isolation. Besides keeping them safe from the coronavirus, how can we make sure our children are protected physically and mentally? It is reassuring to know that with the provision of a consistent supportive environment, most children do well.

The most important way is to make them feel safe and secure. This can only be done if the parent or caregiver is feeling secure themselves. It is important to understand that everyone in the world is affected by the pandemic. Some of us are hit harder than others but the feeling of uncertainty is universal. Therefore, the best solution is to focus on what is in our control. Taking care of our own mental well-being is the best gift a parent can give to their child.

Instead of leaving children to interpret the current situation on their own, explain what is happening around them in an age-appropriate way. Do not wait for them to ask questions; be proactive in sitting down with them and asking them about their opinions and concerns of the current environment. Find out if they are worried about their or their family’s safety and if they feel scared, angry or sad. Reassurance that you are there to protect them is invaluably helpful.

Use child-friendly materials on Covid-19 to teach them simple hygiene activities such as proper handwashing technique and using your elbow when sneezing among other measures. This will not only make them feel like they are contributing to positive outcomes but will also make them feel like they are in control of the situation. It is also important to limit their exposure to news, social media and discussions of the pandemic as these are often difficult to process for a child.

Creating routine in the child’s life helps diminish the stress stemming from the chaos outside. While a minority of schools in Pakistan are doing a great job of keeping children busy through virtual classes, a majority of schools are unable to keep in contact with their pupils due to the unavailability of support and resources.

It becomes the parents’ and caregivers’ responsibility to keep children engaged with learning, safe activities and playtime. Some ideas to keep them busy include learning new languages, learning how to play new instruments or learning how to cook. Depending on the availability of the internet, enrolling in free online courses provided by reputable international institutions is also an option. Furthermore, social distancing may have isolated some children from their only source of emotional support – friends or family. It is important for them to stay connected through letters, telephone or video chat.

It is vital to know the whereabouts of your child inside and outside of your house. You should know who your child is with 24 hours of the day. Do not leave them with anyone you do not wholly trust. This is a good time to teach them about safeguarding their body and differentiating between safe and unsafe touches. Internet safety rules should be explained to children who have access to the internet and great care must be taken to see that the rules are being adhered to. Professional help should be sought for children that are going through significant emotional or behavioral changes at any time.

Countries with well-organized child protection services are vigilant and prepared to protect their children in tragedies such as the world is going through. The problem with Pakistan is that we have not yet given importance to the protection of our children. Our systems are broken with no coordination between police, child protection agencies and courts. The helplines are a decorative and hollow shell of a well-functioning system and are unable to provide information beyond self-help. Unchecked population growth, poverty and corruption have constricted Pakistan’s ability to provide basic rights to children as agreed upon in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

In this air of unpredictability, I worry for the child who is a victim of physical abuse by their parent. I worry for the child who is being neglected because of a parent’s mental health. I worry for the child who is being sexually abused by their parents, relatives, teachers or religious instructors under the oblivious eye of their caretaker. I worry for the teenager who is being sexually abused in exchange for money or food. I worry for our child beggars. I worry for our child labourers both domestic and otherwise.

Let’s unite to not only safeguard our own children but every child in Pakistan. This can be done by spreading awareness and informing those who are ignorant and do not take these matters seriously. One can only hope that once this pandemic is over, our country’s leaders will give attention to this vulnerable part of our country too.

One such incident took place in the Federal B Industrial Area, where an official of the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) was allegedly found involved in extorting and kidnapping a person for ransom. An FIR was registered at the Federal B Industrial Area police station.

Memon later formed an investigation team to be headed by Crime Investigation Agency Karachi chief DIG Arif Hanif. The issued order states that the investigation team for FIR No. 239/20 would comprise SSP Syed Abdul Rahim Sherazi of the Anti-Violent Crime Cell and SSP Arif Aslam Rao of District Central as its members. The order also states that the team must make sure that it completes the investigation into the Federal B Industrial Area case purely on merit to ensure justice, and report on their progress within the stipulated period.

It was reported a few days ago that a police officer was arrested for his alleged involvement in the kidnapping for ransom of a trader. Sub-Inspector Malik Ashraf Awan of the SIU of the Karachi police was arrested by the Federal B Industrial Area police.

The arrested officer along with his police party, including an assistant sub-inspector and two constables, is believed to have abducted a trader named Almas for ransom.

The victim’s wife told the police that she and her husband had been driving from their home in New Karachi to their relatives’ house in Korangi, during which the police officials kidnapped her husband.

She said she later received a ransom call from a police officer the same day, asking her to come to Shafiq Morr with Rs700,000 in cash for her husband to be released, and also warned her of dire consequences if she did not comply.

The woman immediately informed the 15 police helpline, following which the Federal B Industrial Area police raided the Shafiq Morr area and arrested SI Awan, while his police party managed to escape from the scene. Police officials also rescued the abducted trader and registered a case against SI Awan and his police party. When contacted, DSP Naeem Khan confirmed the arrest and the registration of the case.

In another incident, a video clip of which was widely circulated on social media, police officials allegedly barged into a milk shop in Saudabad to beat up its owner and vandalise his business establishment. The shopkeeper claimed that Saudabad police officials visit his shop daily for free milk.

Memon ordered the Korangi SSP to take immediate notice of the viral video. The SHO has allegedly identified one of the police officials in the clip as Head Constable Amjad, who is posted at the Saudabad police station. He has been suspended, reverted and told to report to Police Lines.

An order to issue a show-cause notice and conduct a formal inquiry by the Saudabad sub-divisional police officer will be issued on Monday. Korangi SSP Ali Raza said that no illegal activity or corruption by any official of the Korangi police will be tolerated at any cost.

He also directed the official to submit the reply on 30 questions with 3-days to the committee. The committee asked the following question that what was the exact time & date of the horrible incident. The time of the entry of the car of the lady from Toll Plaza and exact location of the unfortunate incident on the motorway?

When this motorway (Lahore – Sialkot) was got completed and opened for public? Who is responsible for opening of the motorway without deployment of motorway police, security and other facilities? Who is responsible for the maintenance of the side fence of the motorway? Who was first police official who reached there, police, special branch or any intelligence agency?

How was it presumed that the rape has been done by the persons from the local area? How many telephone calls have been traced and investigated around the areas of incident before and after 3 hours of the incident?

List of the officials deployed from special branch, police, Motorway Police and any other department included in the investigations? In the instant case and the possibility of involvement of nearby persons should be there as the main suspect may be there. Is the Google mapping of the said particular radius of the said location done?

The toll plaza to be checked as to how many cars entered from the same entrance within 10 minutes after passing of the car? The possibility of follow up of the lady by the rapists must not be ignored, as they found the lady alone in the car at night time. Nadra to assist the Punjab Police and analysing the finger prints not only from the order and from the scene but also provide the finger prints from the villagers within 3 kilometers and both sides of the motorway. It may be determined if the car had any technical fault in addition to the patrol shortage?

The Senate committee had taken the issue of Zainab rape case which was successfully concluded after the directions of the committee and thorough deliberations in the committee. It is unfortunate to mark that our police need reforms for social justice. The committee observed in its last meeting that the statement to the CCPO was considered to be highly irresponsible and unprofessional. Under what circumstances and the reasons did CCPO had given such an irresponsible statement on this incident. Did the CCPO asked for the permission from his superiors before issuing his public statement.

Directions have been issued to the FIA to identify the tweets which were given against the victim lady after this incident. The state has to give a sense of safety by providing protection to the public rights at public places and security during traveling movements of an individual from city to other city should not at the personal whim of an individual police officer.

The new IG had taken over the charge a day before the incident took place and the committee expects through investigations and to ensure the arrest of the criminals. The IG motorway to inform the steps taken for the safety of the travelers on the motorways.

The Secretary Communication/Chairman NHA to inform the reasons of the failure of the deployment of the relevant staff for the convenience of the public or what action has been taken if they were absent from the duty.

What measures have the IG Punjab, chief secretary Punjab taken to keep the police forces to stop their indulgence with the land/developers. The committee staff and the concerned departments have been directed to ensure the secrecy of the investigation so that the investigation is not compromised.

The committee may take up the matter in-camera to avoid the leakage of any sensitive information. The committee directed that after the report is submitted the IG Police and the CCPO will be summoned for the clarification of the observations made by the committee.",['Asim Yasin'],"ISLAMABAD: Senate Committee on Interior Chairman Senator Abdul Rehman Malik has taken notice on tragic incident of gang rape at Gujjar Pura Lahore-Sialkot Motorway.

1563,576,877,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/701665-five-year-old-girl-slain-after-sexual-assault,,Five-year-old girl slain after sexual assault,"NOWSHERA: A five-year-old girl child was murdered after being subjected to sexual assault and severe torture by unidentified culprits, sources said.

Official sources said Imran Khan, son of Sher Zameen Khan, a resident of Bajaur tribal district presently living in Hamza Rashaka, Kheshgi Payan in the limits of the Risalpur Police Station, reported the gory incident to police. He said his daughter, Seema, 5, went out of her house to play outside. “We launched a search for her when she did not return home by 3 pm in the afternoon,” he added.

The devastated father of the child, who is a mason by profession and lives in a rented house, said local children noticed blood spots near an abandoned poultry farm almost 100 yards away from his house.

He said the search led to recovery of the body of his child from the poultry farm which had been stuffed in a gunnysack. The aggrieved parent said two bold-stained bricks, a dagger and two sharp blades were found lying near the sack. He said the family took the body to the District Headquarters Hospital.

The man said his child body bore several torture marks. “She had been killed so brutally that her body had numerous stab wounds and her face had been defaced,” he said. The father of the slain child said she had been sexually assaulted as well. He said the DHQ staff did not carry out the postmortem on the body and asked the family to take it to the Khyber Medical University in Peshawar. Postmortem was conducted there and the body returned to the family.

District Police Officer Najmul Hasnain said an investigation had been launched into the heinous act by collecting pieces of evidence from the crime scene.

He said geo-fencing had been done as well. The official said the police had constituted a joint investigation team. The postmortem had been conducted and the DNA samples of the victim were dispatched to a forensic laboratory.

The DPO said a case had been registered against the unidentified killers under Section 302 and Child Protection Act. Senior police officials, including Deputy Inspector General of Police, Mardan Range, Sher Akbar Khan, DPO Najmul Hasnain Senior Superintendent of Police (Investigation) Noor Jamal met the family.

The officials assured the father of the child and other family members that police would leave no stone unturned in arresting the culprits and bringing them to justice. The father of the child told the senior cops that he was a poor man and was doing masonry to earn a living for the family.

He said the family lived in a rented house and had no enmity with anyone. The family appealed to the apex court, Chief Minister Mahmood Khan, and KP Police Chief Sanaullah Abbasi to provide them justice by identifying and punishing the heartless culprits.

MANSEHRA: Two teenagers were murdered in Kaghan valley allegedly for wanting to marry against their parents’ wishes, Geo News reported on Wednesday.

According to SHO Kaghan Police Station Wajid Khan, the girl wanted to tie the knot with her cousin instead of her fiancé. However, their parents were against the wedding and as a result, killed them both. “When police rushed to the scene, the families refused to register a first information report (FIR) of the incident,” said Khan.

He added the father of the boy Muhammad Shahid, the father of the girl, and Muhammad Shahid, the uncle of both deceased were arrested and shifted to the police station. Khan said the parents of the slain couple first planned the killing and then executed the plan.

“When police rushed to the scene the families refused to register a first information report (FIR) registered of the incident,” he added.

Earlier this year, a family in Muridke allegedly tortured and killed their son-in-law over his marriage to their daughter by choice.

Police said the newly-wed woman's family later called the couple to their home under the pretence of reconciling with them but, instead, tied up her husband and subjected him to violence.

Police said that Abid is being brought to Lahore from Faisalabad where his DNA test will be taken.

The other suspect who allegedly raped the woman, Shafqat, is in jail on judicial remand. The Intelligence Bureau (IB), Special Branch of the police and other agencies had done a recce of the suspect and tipped off Punjab Police about the whereabouts of Malhi.

Malhi's DNA test had been obtained thrice from the motorway rape victim's samples. However, once more his DNA test will be taken and matched with the samples before any formal proceedings begin against him.

Key points about motorway rape suspect Abid Malhi's arrest:

- Suspect falls into trap laid out by Punjab police

- Police used Malhi's wife to lure him to Faisalabad

- His DNA test will be taken and matched with samples of the victim

- After the DNA tests, formal proceedings against Malhi will be initiated

- Punjab Police intentionally ""cooled things down"", says Fayyaz Chohan

- Malhi got to know about police raids from media reports: Chohan

The motorway rape case's prime suspect had managed to evade arrest four times by escaping the clutches of the Punjab police.

How did police manage to catch the motorway rape suspect?

Sources told Geo News that a trap had been laid out for the motorway rape prime suspect, falling into which he was apprehended by police. Sources informed Geo News that Malhi's wife was given a SIM which she used to call him.

Malhi told his wife in one of his calls to her that he would meet her in Faisalabad. When the motorway rape suspect arrived in the city to meet her, he was nabbed by police officials in plain clothes.

According to Geo News correspondent Ahmad Faraz, Malhi was arrested without any torture or scuffle. He was apprehended easily and taken from Faisalabad to Lahore.

Punjab govt to do everything in its power to make 'example out of him'

Speaking to Geo News, Punjab information minister Fayyaz Chohan said that the provincial government would do everything in its power to make an example out of the motorway rape suspect.

Talking about how the Punjab government aims to prosecute Malhi as he had managed to be secure a bail previously despite rape charges, he said:

Chohan said that without speaking to the motorway rape victim, the Punjab government had managed to identify the suspects within 72 hours.

""No shortcomings will take place from [the government's side],"" Chohan said of the case.

He said that Malhi had managed to escape the clutches of the police due to detailed media hype and reporting about him.

""Due to the media's hype regarding the case, he escaped police raids four to five times as he used to get information from his sources about the police,"" said the information minister.

Chohan said that the Punjab police had ""intentionally cooled down things"" over the things and observed that Malhi had also relaxed over the past 10-12 days which ultimately led him to become less careful.

The minister said that to hide details of the investigation from the public at large, he used to ""play down questions asked to me"" about the motorway gang-rape case during press conferences.

The information minister stressed that if the prosecution, police, and the judicial system play their role in the right manner, then such people would not escape the law again.

Prime suspect in motorway rape case raped woman and her daughter in 2013

According to reports, Shafqat and Abid were at the Lahore-Sialkot motorway on Sept 9 with an intention to rob any motorist when they saw a stationary white-coloured car on the roadside. The two approached the vehicle, threatened and robbed its occupants, and then gang-raped the woman in front of her children after dragging them to a nearby field.

Police had earlier disclosed that apart from Shafqat's statement, his DNA had to match as well, which is why the samples had been sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA). The arrest was made with use of footprint-tracking as well as DNA samples.

The PFSA had Abid's prior DNA records from 2013, when he had raped a woman and her daughter and was booked alongside four others under Sections 376 and 395. While he had been bailed out at the time, his DNA and fingerprint records were saved in the lab's data bank.

The lab's system identified him as the same rapist from more than seven years ago.

PEMRA directs to stop coverage of motorway rape case

On October 2, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) had barred all satellite TV channels from covering the motorway rape case.

A notification from the regulatory authority had stated that the airing of content related to the investigation of the case will diminish the ""evidentiary worth of the material collected by the prosecution"".

PEMRA stated in its notification that since the offence is related to a sex crime, hence media coverage concerning the victim and her family will also be a cause of discomfort and disgrace for her.

The authority told news channels to refrain from airing any content with regard to the case on electronic, print, and social media, in the future, and warned that in case of non-compliance, strict legal action will be taken as per PEMRA's ordinance.

What is the motorway rape case about?

Malhi has been on the run since September 9, when it was reported that two robbers had allegedly gang-raped a mother of three on the Lahore-Sialkot motorway in an area falling within Gujjarpura police's jurisdiction.

The woman, along with her children, was driving to Gujranwala when she was forced to stop at the Gujjarpura section of the motorway after running out of fuel, at around 1:30am.

She immediately called a relative and sent him her location. He asked her to also dial the Motorway Police helpline 130 from which she reportedly received no response.

In the meantime, two robbers reportedly approached the car, broke the window, and took the woman and her children to nearby bushes where they allegedly raped her in front of the children.

They also allegedly snatched her purse carrying Rs100,000 in cash, one bracelet, car registration papers, and three ATM cards.",[],"The prime suspect in the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway gang-rape case, Abid Malhi, was arrested on Monday after a period of over one month, Geo News reported.

1149,162,271,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/738635-protecting-the-minority,,Protecting the minority,"The sudden case of Arzoo Masih, known better as Arzoo Raja, has brought some much-needed attention to the problem of forced conversions and our general treatment of religious minorities. The case began when she was abducted from inside her home while playing with her brother and sister by a neighbour said to be 44 years old. The neighbour has claimed he chose to marry her since she was 18 years old, although her documents, including certificates from her birth and her school show her to be no more than 13. A lower court then decided that she should be allowed to go with her husband. After the news broke in the media, the Sindh government promised that it would indeed implement the Child Marriages Act which prohibits the marriage of any person aged under 18 in the province. There are also other laws on forced conversions that are in place in the province.

Fortunately, after a delay, during which poor Arzoo must have suffered a great degree of trauma as did her parents, the case seems to be heading towards some sort of resolution. The Sindh High Court has ordered that Arzoo be moved to a shelter home till the matter is decided and has also suggested that she would be best placed with her parents. Minority rights groups in the province and also minority MNAs have been condemning the case, and also the delayed action of the Sindh government. They point out that the laws are useless unless they can be enforced. This indeed is the case. Minority groups from other provinces have also staged protests.

The problem has gone on for far too long. It is time that some definite action was taken, and some measures put in place to protect young girls from such marriages. The Hindu community has been a victim in the past. Christians in Punjab have also suffered similar violence in similar forced marriages. Such a blase attitude in a country where girls from minority communities are abducted and forcibly converted every month shows how little attention is paid to the rights of minorities. Even leaving aside the fact that it is doubtful those of minor age are capable of freely changing their religion, is there any doubt that the concerns of the parents would not have been swept away immediately had they not been poor and religiously in the minority?

The entire matter is a grave offence of human rights. What we need is action on the ground. This has come in Arzoo's case and we hope the matter will be settled as per the law and as per the situation that exists. No child aged 13 can determine whom to marry or whether to change her religion. Until we take concrete action to counter this issue of forced marriages and conversions, we have no right to boast about how equal rights are granted to all. Instead, we need to look at ourselves and decide if this is the kind of discriminatory society we want to maintain going forward.",[],"Minority rights groups in the province and also minority MNAs have been condemning the case, and also the delayed action of the Sindh government.

Until we take concrete action to counter this issue of forced marriages and conversions, we have no right to boast about how equal rights are granted to all.","['minority', 'action', 'protecting', 'arzoo', 'parents', 'case', 'forced', 'matter', 'sindh', 'marriages', 'rights']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/700X390_thenews.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg,1,FALSE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'Protecting the minority | Editorial | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'The sudden case of Arzoo Masih, known better as Arzoo Raja, has brought some much-needed attention to the problem of forced conversions and our general treatment of religious minorities.

The latest example was the ‘ridiculous’ dialogues between the governments and the private transporters. One can only express shock and dismay as to how these people can so blatantly challenge and violate the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) put into force by the federal and provincial governments if they want to start their operations!

On one hand, these transporters had been protesting and pleading, against and to, the government to let them resume their business.

They always cried for special compensation/relief packages to mitigate the losses they had suffered because of being pushed out of business following the imposition of ‘lockdown’ by the government to prevent spread of COVID-19 pandemic.

Each time any of these businessmen, be those the ‘Shadi Hall/Marque’ operators, transporters, Shopping Mall owners, entertainment industry operators, small and mid-level industrialists talked about the losses they have suffered, the amount was always mentioned in billions!

One wonders if the amount of losses they claimed they have suffered, would this not be a golden opportunity for the government or the FBR or any other relevant departments to take them on their words and sift through records as to how much income tax and other taxes they are supposed to pay have been paid by them in the past?

The amounts of losses these people are pushing forward they have suffered over a period of two or three months are fabulous, none mentioning losses less then billions of rupees!

Whomsoever the government tries to follow the laws and rules, they instantly go on strike, making the government to bow eventually. Just like the flour mill owners did a few days back.

However, right now it is the transporters who are openly challenging the writ of the federal and provincial governments for following the SOPs! They are not ready to reduce the number of passengers they will be carrying in their vehicles.

They have refused to scale down the fares despite the fact that the POL prices have gone down considerably low. They are openly over-charging from the passengers who are stranded in different cities and towns all over the country and are desperate to go to their homes to celebrate Eid with their families.",['Mobarik A.

The Sindh government on Friday announced that it would write a letter to the Centre asking it to present the highest police award to the assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Mohammad Bux Buriro involved in arresting the Kashmore rape suspect.

The father-daughter duo will be awarded, Sindh government spokesperson Murtaza Wahab said while addressing a press conference in Karachi.

""Without the bravery and courage of the ASI, the arrest would not have been possible,"" said Wahab. He announced that the Sindh government will recommend to the Centre that Buriro be given the highest police award — the Quaid-i-Azam Police Medal.

Wahab said that the suspect had admitted to raping the woman. He said that DNA samples had been sent to a laboratory in Sindh and the results will be back in two days.

ASI Buriro had helped in arresting a suspect who allegedly raped a mother and her four-year-old daughter in Sindh's Kashmore district. The woman had accused the suspect of raping her and the daughter after she arrived at his home from Karachi.

The victim told police she had been duped by the suspect over a job offer. According to her complaint, the men had kept her daughter hostage and released the victim, telling her to bring them another woman from Karachi.

It was then that the ASI's daughter acted as a decoy with the victim and invited the suspect to a hotel. As soon as he arrived, police arrested the suspect and took him into custody.

Wahab said that the Sindh government will recommend the Centre to award the ASI's daughter with the highest civil award for her role in the alleged rapist's arrest.

""If she wishes to pursue higher education, the expenses will be borne by Sindh government,"" he said, announcing a Rs1 million cash award for her as well.",[],"— Geo NewsThe Sindh government on Friday announced that it would write a letter to the Centre asking it to present the highest police award to the assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Mohammad Bux Buriro involved in arresting the Kashmore rape suspect.

Six men gang-raped a woman in Punab's Jaranwala city on Wednesday, according to police, as she was waiting for another van after the bus she was travelling in broke down.



The woman was standing at a bus stop when a car stopped there and offered to give her a lift. Afterwards, the men proceeded to drug the woman and rape her in the car, said police.



The men threw then women in a nearby field before fleeing. Police said they have registered a case against the suspects but so far, no one has been arrested for the crime.



CM Punjab Buzdar takes notice



Chief Minister Usman Buzdar took strict notice of the incident, calling on RPO Sheikhupura to arrest the suspects as soon as possible and ensure they be handed exemplary punishments.



The incident takes place a month after the Lahore motorway gang-rape case caused widespread anger and condemnation.

Police had said that two armed men had raped a woman stranded with her children on the motorway before robbing her of money and other valuables.

The woman, a resident of Gujranwala, was on her way back to the city from Lahore's Ring Road at 1:30 am on Tuesday night, when her car ran out of petrol near Gujjarpura around an hour later.

The woman had waited for her husband and phoned a relative for help, who advised her to call the Motorway Police. She subsequently called the Motorway Police's 130 emergency helpline for assistance but was told by the operator that she could not be provided help as the emergency beat had not been assigned to anyone.",[],"The woman was standing at a bus stop when a car stopped there and offered to give her a lift.

1624,637,961,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/601492-140-child-domestic-workers-tortured-raped-or-murdered-in-a-decade,,"‘140 child domestic workers tortured, raped or murdered in a decade’","Releasing a report that compiled the statistics of abuse, torture, rapes and murders of child domestic workers across the country from the media, rights groups on Sunday demanded of all provincial governments to ban child domestic work thorough legislation.

Three rights-based groups – the Hari Welfare Association (HWA), the Pakistan Institute of Labour Education and Research (Piler), and the Institute for Social Justice (ISJ) – jointly issued a report that reveals that more than 140 cases of abuse, torture, rapes and murders of child domestic workers (CDWs) were reported in the media during the past ten years.

The statistics have been compiled from media reports and therefore the actual number could be higher than it. Most of the cases of child sexual abuse are not reported in the media as such cases are often brushed under the rug because of its taboo nature, said Akram Khaskheli, the HWA president.

The report, mainly compiled by the ISJ, said that for the child domestic workers every single year was horrible but in terms of reporting of their torture and abuse the years of 2013, 2017 and 2019 were the worst, in which 21, 27 and 19 cases of abuse with CDWs were respectively reported in the media.

According to the statistics, of the total in ten years, 96 children were tortured and raped, and 44 of them were murdered. Of the total 140 reported cases, 79 per cent were reported from Punjab, 14 per cent from Sindh, six per cent from Islamabad and one percent from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The statement lamented that child domestic work is rampant in all provinces and children are silently and badly abused, and exploited inside the boundary walls; however, the cases of abuse, torture, and murders are mainly reported from Punjab, slightly from Sindh and some from Islamabad. Cases of abuse and torture on CDWs are not reported from KP and Balochistan, it said.

Of 140 children, 48 (34 per cent) children were ten years old and below, 56 (40 per cent) children between 11 to 14 years old, and 36 (26 per cent) children between 15 to 18 years old, according to media reports.

Sharing the reports of abuse with child domestic workers in 2019, the report said that only cases of female CDWs were reported; of which, five children were murdered and 14 were tortured, while many among them were raped.

During that year, as usual, the majority of the cases, 15 to be exact, were reported from Punjab. In 2019, Maryam, 13, was murdered in Gujranwala; Uzama, 16, was murdered in Lahore; Faiza, 13, was murdered in Karachi; Khadija, 10, burnt with iron in Gujranwala; A, 10, was brutally tortured in Lahore; M, 13, was murdered in Wazirabad; Rehana, 10, missing in Lahore (parents feared that employers had murdered her); A, 13, raped in Rawalpindi; Rukhsana, 10, brutally tortured in Lahore; Jeena, 10, on which hot water was poured in Ferozabad; Fatima, 7, brutally tortured in Lahore; G, 10, brutally tortured in Lahore; F, 11, brutally tortured in Islamabad; Maria, 7, tortured in Faisalabad; N, 11, raped and murdered in Lahore; S, 13, raped in Karachi; Ariffa, 12, brutally tortured in Lahore; Mubeen Bibi, 15, murdered in Lahore; and N, 8, tortured in Karachi.

The civil society groups in their joint statement lamented that due to a lack of seriousness on the part of federal and provincial governments, the issue of child domestic labour had not gained attention in the legislative assemblies.

“Tayabba torture case in Islamabad resulted in the engagement of the superior judiciary, which took suo moto notice of the matter. Besides sending the culprits behind bars, the court had ordered the governments to the child domestic work less than 16 years of age and ensure such children’s education,” the statement said, referring to the case of Tayabba, a minor maid, who was tortured in by a judge and his wife.

The child domestic work is recognised as modern slavery and falls under the category of work forms of the child labour. In 2001, Pakistan ratified the International Labour Organisation’s convention titled ‘Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention’. The ILO recognises child domestic work as the worst form of labour.

HWA’s Khaskheli said the Sindh Assembly had passed the Sindh Child Protection Authority Act in 2011, aimed to form child protection units at district level across the province. “But the Act has not been implemented properly as most of the districts do not have any child protection units that could safeguard children's rights,” he said. “Even child protection units which are active in some of the districts unfortunately lack manpower, funds and infrastructure.”

Mentioning the Sindh Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 2015, Khaskheli said the bill was aimed to overcome bonded labour in the province. “However, it has also not been implemented properly and children have been working in the agriculture sector.”

In December 2018, the Punjab government had also promised to the Lahore High Court that it would ban child domestic work less for kids under 15, and in that regard the government was supposed to table a bill in the provincial assembly.",['Zia Ur Rehman'],"Releasing a report that compiled the statistics of abuse, torture, rapes and murders of child domestic workers across the country from the media, rights groups on Sunday demanded of all provincial governments to ban child domestic work thorough legislation.

Meanwhile, Waqarul Hassan, the other suspect in the case identified by the Punjab government, had surrendered himself on Sunday at Lahore's Model Town police station. He claimed that his brother-in-law was using the mobile phone which had wrongly implicated him in the crime, adding that he himself was not involved.

Police shared on Monday that further investigations have suggested that Waqarul Hasan may indeed not have been involved, adding that a final decision on the matter will be taken after they receive the DNA report of the suspect.

The police said Waqar had revealed that prime suspect Abid used to commit crimes along with an individual named Shafqat. They added that Waqar told them that Shafqat was a resident of Bahawalnagar and a friend of Abid.

The police said that they have dispatched teams to Bahawalnagar and Sheikhupura for the arrest of Shafqat following the revelation by Waqar. They also shared that the police has also arrested the brother-in-law and other relatives of prime suspect Abid Ali.

Chohan compares motorway rape case with Zainab case

Punjab’s Information Minister Fayyaz ul Hasan Chohan, when asked about the delay in the arrest of Abid Ali, compared the case to the 2018 rape and murder of seven-year-old Zainab.

“Even three years ago when the Zainab rape case happened, it took three months to get hold of the culprits although the province had used all of its powers to get hold of the culprits,” reminded Chohan while speaking to Geo Pakistan.

The minister said that Abid Ali had committed rape for the first time in June 2013 and a first information report (FIR) was lodged against him but he was released after some time during Shahbaz Sharif’s government. He also shared that the forensic report had also been finalised months after his release.

He recalled that police have carried out geofencing of the area and have been working day and night with 28 teams on the case. He also shared that the law enforcement agency was able to identify Abid Ali “within 72 hours”.

“Yesterday, Waqarul Hassan surrendered after the police closely tracked him down. The police should be given credit where it is due,” said Chohan.

Talking about laws regarding protection of women and children, the minister said that there were a lot of laws for the safety of women and children ""but they are never implemented”.

“This is my personal opinion, not the government’s stance, but I think the rapists should be punished publicly after fulfilling all legal terms,” said the minister. He added if this does not happen then a speedy investigation and prosecution should be done.

Parents' appeal to authorities

Meanwhile, speaking to Geo News, Waqar's mother said that her son is innocent and that he decided to surrender himself after he got to know of the incident.

""If my son had done something wrong, he wouldn't have surrendered himself,"" she said. The suspect's mother appealed to Chief Minister Usman Buzdar to ensure justice is served in Waqar's case.

""My son is a pious and religious person, his life should be spared,"" she said, adding: ""He runs a motorcycle repairing shop in Qilla Sattar Shah.""

""If my son was a culprit, why would he present himself [to the law enforcement agencies],"" she asked.

The mother said that she has four daughters and two sons and one of her sons was ill.

Meanwhile, Waqar's father said that his son is not a ""thief"" and ""works at a shop"".

He said Waqar is ""innocent"" and appealed to the authorities to release him.

Rs2.5 million reward

On Saturday, Chief Minister Punjab Usman Buzdar had announced a reward of Rs2.5 million for each of the suspects if information leading to their arrest is shared. He said that the identity of those bringing forward any information will be kept confidential.

""We worked day and night and launched a probe using scientific techniques. I personally monitored the progress and directed the completion of the probe expediently,"" Buzdar had said.

According to the chief minister, seven cases — including two gang-rape cases — were registered against Abid, while two robbery cases were filed against Waqar who was reportedly released 14 days earlier on bail.

Buzdar said that the culprits will be given exemplary punishment for the heinous crime.

While briefing the media about how the police identified the suspects, Inspector General of Police Inam Ghani had said, ""Geo-fencing of the entire area was carried out, data was taken from the Election Commission of Pakistan, fingerprints were taken from the site, and DNA tests were conducted"".

IGP Ghani said that after the police went through the records they had gathered they got to know that Abid Ali had four SIMs registered in his name that he used on several occasions. All of the SIMs, however, were currently non-functional.

""Ultimately, we tracked down another number — that was not registered to his name — and it proved our suspicions right. Through this number, we were able to reach his partner as well,"" he said.

The Punjab police chief added: ""We are 95% sure that [the person we have tracked down] is his partner as his phone signals were traced to the location of the crime [at the time of the incident].""

The incident

On Wednesday night, it was reported that two robbers had allegedly gang-raped a mother of two on the Lahore-Sialkot motorway in an area falling within Gujjarpura police's jurisdiction.

The woman, along with her two children, was driving to Gujranwala when she was forced to stop at the Gujjarpura section of the motorway after running out of fuel, at around 1:30am.

She immediately called a relative and sent him her location. He asked her to also dial the Motorway Police helpline 130 from which she reportedly received no response.

In the meantime, two robbers reportedly approached the car, broke the window, and took the woman and her children to nearby bushes where they allegedly raped her in front of the children.

They also allegedly snatched her purse carrying Rs100,000 in cash, one bracelet, car registration papers, and three ATM cards.",[],"Authorities continue to carry out raids for the arrest of key suspect in the motorway gang rape case, Abid Ali, who continues to remain at large.

Speaking at a press conference here at the Karachi Press Club on Wednesday Shibli said the opposition parties had formed the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) to protect the wealth accumulated through corruption and not for any political cause. They were trying to divert the attention of masses from their corruption and seek an NRO (National Reconciliation Ordinance) from the government. He said that government would not come under any pressure of opposition’s blackmailing. The minister said the opposition parties had made politics a business. “They cannot pressurise the government for any kind of NRO.

The government under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan will continue its struggle to recover the looted national wealth, he added.

Senator Shibli Faraz has said that the federal government has taken no unconstitutional or illegal step by promulgating the ordinance to establish the Pakistan Islands Development Authority (PIDA).

Speaking at a press conference here at the Karachi Press Club on Wednesday, the federal minister said that the Constitution has the provision for promulgating the ordinances and the government has adopted a legal method to establish the PIDA.

He said that the government was developing a mechanism to link the provision of advertisements to media houses with the payment of salaries to their employees. The government had paid over Rs1 billion to the media outlets to clear their outstanding dues and tried to ensure that the employees’ salaries were paid from that amount, he said.

Earlier, talking to media persons at the Mazar-e-Quaid, the federal information minister said that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was given the mandate by the people to bring those who had plundered the national wealth to justice.

The incumbent government, which had completed two years in office, was making all-out efforts to steer the country out of crises and put it on the path to development. Everyone would have to work for the country’s development. He said Karachi was the country’s economic hub and despite limited resources, the federal government had initiated K-IV, Karachi circular railway and sewerage system. Replying to a question regarding the problems faced by the Karachiites due to the recent rains, Shibli Faraz said Prime Minister Imran Khan had directed for taking immediate steps to resolve them.

Like the mega city, he said, the PTI government also accorded importance to the development of other areas of Sindh to bring them at par with the rest of the country. Unfortunately, the Sindh government was not playing its due role in this regard, he regretted. Senator Shibli Faraz said that this was on record that first time the government had given advertisements to the newspapers, through transparent mechanism.

He expressed these views while talking to the office bearers of All Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS) here. Speaking on the occasion, President APNS Hameed Haroon briefed the minister in detail about the problems of print media, especially, the problems which were being confronted by the Sindhi newspapers. Secretary General APNS Sarmad Ali and other office bearers also spoke on the occasion.

Meanwhile, Shibli Faraz highlighted the need for a coordinated mechanism to help address genuine grievances of electronic media in the country. During a meeting with office-bearers of Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA), he said regular contact and mutual cooperation could help in efficient handling of issues, ultimately paving the way for their proper solutions. had paid over Rs1 billion to the media outlets to clear their outstanding dues and tried to ensure that the employees’ salaries were paid from that amount, he said.

Police said the arrested girl had been identified as 18-year-old Binish who used to steal motorcycles along with her two accomplices 14-year-old Chohto and 20-year-old Basit who are yet to be arrested.

The girl is said to be a resident of Lyari and she practised boxing. She, however, denied the accusations and said that she did not steal any motorcycle but someone had given a stolen motorcycle to her. She said she was arrested because police recovered the stolen motorcycle from her possession.

Meanwhile, police claimed that the three-member gang used to snatch or steal motorcycles of new models and they were also looking for the dealers to whom the gang sold those motorcycles. The girl has been handed over to the women police.

Eight thieves held

The Anti-Vehicle Lifting Cell (AVLC) of the Karachi police on Tuesday carried out raids in different parts of the city and arrested eight suspects for stealing motorbikes.

The AVLC spokesman said the suspects were arrested during separate raids carried out in the Lyari, SITE Area and Gulberg localities of the city. Police also claimed to have impounded five stolen two-wheelers and seized a pistol.

The spokesman said the detainees are habitual motorbike lifters who used to sell the two-wheelers’ parts to mechanics and scrap dealers, adding that they have been arrested for the first time, so they do not have any earlier criminal record.

The arrested suspects have been identified as Aftab Gulzar, Shahrukh Hanif, Shehbaz Kali, Faisal Shafi, Ghulam Rasool Abdul Rasheed (alias Bhola), Yasir Nasir, Mehboob Abdul Ghaffar (alias Ali) and Falak Sher Abdul Qadir.

The spokesman of the AVLC said the motorbikes impounded during the raids had been reported stolen at the Nabi Bakhsh, Brigade, Madina Colony and Azizabad police stations.","['Oc', 'Our Correspondent']","The Mauripur police on Tuesday arrested a teenage girl who allegedly stole motorcyles in the city while disguising herself as a boy.

It is beyond belief how someone that young can consent to marrying anyone, let alone someone in their 40s. The fact that a high court validated the marriage of the minor girl means only one thing that our state is allowing the rape of a minor and we are watching it happen silently. The religious angle of the case makes it harder for the people to be outraged since we have not learnt to even mourn, let alone stand up, for religious minority communities.

True consciousness is the ability to recognise oneself as the enemy. It is easy to point fingers at India/Israel/ the West or any other fictitious symbol of evil. But it is much more difficult to accept the evil that resides within us. Unless we muster the courage to stand with a minor abandoned by the state, we will remain to be unwilling participants in horrific crimes against the children of this nation.

On July 2, 2020, neither the local police nor the PRU, Dolphin and other patrolling squads could help the ill-fated girl who was gang-raped alongside a road in the limits of Gujarpura police.

Unfortunately, Lahore police did not learn any lesson from the girl’s case. If police had made the patrolling system more effective by increasing police patrolling in the unpopulated city areas and highways, the mother of three children would have been saved from falling prey to the robbers-cum-rapists.

The latest incident has sent shivers down the spines of Lahorites. The criminals who only robbed people on pavements in the provincial metropolis are now freely using these spaces for the fulfillment of their culpable lust.

The question that arises here is that how these robbers have the audacity to commit such a heinous crime. Are the Dolphin and PRU officials really doing their job, or is the patrolling just another opportunity for these men to get together for a group hangout? For most of these officers and officials, this job has proved to be a double delight as they do not only get paid for doing nothing, but get to ramble through the city without any transportation cost to bear. It is the citizens who are being charged for these costs, by not just getting robbed of their valuables but dignity as well. The girl who was raped about two months back served as an assistant in a homeopathic clinic at Suggian village.

On the day of the incident, she along with her employer was on her way back home in a car when four armed robbers intercepted their vehicle and made them hostage at gunpoint. The robbers conducted thorough search of the victims and deprived them of their valuables, including cash and cell phones.

The two robbers forcibly dragged the girl out of the car, took her to the roadside and gang-raped her. The then IG Punjab Shoaib Dastgir had also taken notice of the incident as the present IGP Inam Ghani also directed Lahore police to submit a report and arrest the culprits. The newly-posted IGP Punjab Ghani pledged that if any such incident takes place in future, the police concerned will be answerable. When contacted, a spokesperson for Lahore Investigation Wing told that the four culprits involved in the girl’s case were arrested and jailed.",['Salman Aslam'],"LAHORE:Police could have prevented the gang-rape of a woman on the motorway if they had learnt a lesson from the rape of a 19-year-old girl by robbers on a roadside in the Gujjarpura police limits about two months ago.

Sindh Inspector-General Police Mushtaq Mahar on Tuesday decided to defer his own leave and ordered police officers to set aside their leave applications for 10 days in the ""larger national interest"" till the conclusion of Captain (retd) Safdar's arrest inquiry.

""The unfortunate incident that occurred on the night of 18/19 October caused great heartache and resentment within all ranks of Sindh Police,"" a tweet from the Sindh Police read.

Following the ""unfortunate incident"", IG Sindh decided to proceed on leave and subsequently all ranks decided that they would also apply for leave to protest the ""humiliation meted out to Sindh police"".

""This was a spontaneous and heartfelt reaction and made on an individual rather than a collective basis because every single member of the department felt an acute sense of disrespect,"" the Twitter handle of the Sindh Police said.

The Sindh police said that it was ""immensely grateful to the Chief of Army Staff Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa that he realised the sense of ""hurt that prevailed within a uniformed force"", and ordered an inquiry into the matter.

It also thanked PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and the Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah for visiting the IG House and showing solidarity with the police leadership.

""Sindh police has always been a disciplined force which believes in institutional harmony between all key national institutions and has always been cognisant of its responsibility to serve and protect the citizens of this province,""it added.

The development comes after the police chief, senior Sindh Police officers applied for leave as the Captain Safdar arrest controversy intensified, with the senior command of the Sindh Police saying that the episode had left police ""shocked and demoralised"".



The officials reportedly included the Additional Inspector General (AIG) Karachi, the AIG Special Branch (whose application for leave has been widely circulated) and several Deputy Inspectors General (DIG) of police.



An application signed by AIG Special Branch Imran Yaqoob, which has been making the rounds on social media, reads that he wishes to proceed on leave because the police high command has been “ridiculed and mishandled”, leading to demoralisation within the ranks of Sindh Police.



“In such a stressful situation, it is quite difficult for me to discharge my duty in a professional manner,” AIG Imran has said.

He added that he needed 60-day earned leaves to “come out of the shock and settle down”.

According to a Geo News correspondent, 12-13 other police officers have submitted similar leave requests.

The officers have reportedly said that if their request is not entertained, they will simply stop showing up to their postings.

Chaos in Sindh Police

A day earlier, Sindh Police's Digital Media Cell had tweeted, then deleted, then tweeted again a statement defending Captain Safdar's arrest, saying it was done ""according to the law"".

The department's Twitter activity, which indicated that not all was well within the provincial police, had raised eyebrows.

Controversy had already been brewing over the circumstances surrounding Captain Safdar's arrest, with PML-N representatives claiming that the police had been put under pressure to pick him up.

Representatives of the Sindh government had publicly distanced themselves from the arrest and condemned it, saying that while Captain Safdar raising slogans at the Quaid-e-Azam's Mazar was not condonable, the arrest had been made without its knowledge.

Captain Safdar's arrest

Retired Captain Safdar — Nawaz Sharif's son-in-law and Maryam Nawaz's spouse — was arrested in the early hours of Monday by Sindh Police for, among other charges, allegedly violating the sanctity of Quaid-e-Azam's Mazar (also called Mazar-e-Quaid).

The sanctity of the Quaid's Mazar is protected by The Quaid-i-Azam’s Mazar (Protection and Maintenance) Ordinance, 1971, which explicitly forbids political activities within the premises of the mausoleum.

""No person shall organise, convene or take part in any meeting or demonstration or procession or engage in political activity within the premises of Quaid's mausoleum or within a distance of ten feet from the outer boundary thereof,"" reads the law on the matter.

In a press conference earlier in the day, Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah said that an attempt was made to put the police under pressure, with PTI ministers going to the police on two different occasions to register a case and on a third occasion accompanying the Mazar-e-Quaid board.

They were told by police that a summary trial like the one sought falls under the jurisdiction of a judicial magistrate and it is not up to the police to register a case, said CM Shah. He said the police had refused to fall under pressure.

Nonetheless, the CM Sindh said, the petitioner had ""manufactured"" a complaint saying that he had been threatened with his life, due to which police had to take action.",[],"— Photo courtesy Sindh PoliceSindh Inspector-General Police Mushtaq Mahar on Tuesday decided to defer his own leave and ordered police officers to set aside their leave applications for 10 days in the ""larger national interest"" till the conclusion of Captain (retd) Safdar's arrest inquiry.

1221,234,370,https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/723539-nehal-hashmi-booked,,Nehal Hashmi booked after family and police brawl in Karachi,"KARACHI: Police officials and Nehal Hashmi's family got into a scuffle in the city's Malir Town area on Friday night, with the former PML-N senator's son accusing police officials of attacking him and his mother.

The police have reportedly detained Hashmi and his sons, one of them Naseer Hashmi, following the incident. An FIR No 324/20 was registered against the PML-N leader and his two sons at the Saudabad police station on behalf of Saudabad SHO Rana Haseeb for abusing, scuffling and beating cops.

The fight took place near Malir's busy Saudabad area with police, on the other hand, saying that Nehal Hashmi's family was involved in an altercation with another party.



Police officials said that when they tried to intervene, the senator's family tore the uniforms of the personnel.

According to Deputy Inspector General of Police East, people have gathered outside the station, and some have entered it against police's instructions.

In the video, Hashmi reportedly says: ""You are beating him, you are beating my son. Who are you?""

Meanwhile, his son said: ""Police tried to come near my family. When I tried to stop them, they broke my phone.""

""They attacked my sister and mother,"" his son added.

In a video statement issued late in the night, the PML-N leader's daughter, Ayesha Hashmi, said, ""We were dragged into someone else's matter. They misbehaved with me and my mother."" She said the policemen in plainclothes subjected her brother, Naseer Hashmi, to torture and humiliated her family. ""Police tortured my 17-year-old brother also,"" she said.

Terming it Hashmi's private matter, PML-N leader Muhammad Zubair said the party has nothing to do with it.

The former Sindh governor said it would be premature to say anything until Nehal Hashmi and his family stated their viewpoint on the issue.

Another PML-N member, Asad Usmani, accused police officials of extorting money and the fight started when Hashmi's son stopped them from doing so.

""Nehal Hashmi's son intervened and tried to stop them [from collecting extortion money],"" he said. ""Two police cars came by, taking Nehal Hashmi and his sons with them to the police station.

Usmani said he had arrived outside the police station but the door had been closed and no one was being allowed to enter.

1280,293,454,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/711043-family-blocks-university-road-for-hours-after-girl-found-raped-and-murdered,,Family blocks University Road for hours after girl found raped and murdered,"Angered residents of the Essa Nagri area in Gulshan-e-Iqbal held an hours-long protest on Sunday on the main University Road, following the recovery of the body of an abducted minor girl who had been killed after being raped.

The culprits had even torched her body so that it could not be identified and dumped it into a vacant plot in the area. Meanwhile, police claimed to have taken one of the neighbours of the victim into custody for his alleged involvement in the abduction, rape and murder of the girl.

The family ended the protest after giving a three-day ultimatum to the government and police and warned of holding another major protest if the real culprits were not traced and arrested within three days.

The minor girl was kidnapped a couple of days ago and her body bearing torture marks was found in the early hours of Sunday near her residence in the Essa Nagri area that falls within the jurisdiction of the PIB Colony police station.

The body was shifted to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre where the initial post-mortem report suggested that the girl had been sexually assaulted and that she had died due to head injuries.

Following the incident, the parents and family members of the victim gathered near Hassan Square at around 12 noon and held a protest on University Road. Later, a large number of their relatives and neighbours also joined the protest. The protesters blocked the flow of traffic for hours from Hassan Square to New Town.

Videos of the protest shared on social media also showed some protesters carrying sticks and asking the commuters to take alternative routes. Police officials tried to persuade the protesters multiple times to end the protest but they did not listen.

The funeral prayers for the victim were also offered during the protest after Zuhr prayers. She was then laid to rest at a graveyard in Baldia Town. The protest, however, continued after the funeral prayers and burial.

The victim’s paternal uncle told the media that the girl’s father was a rickshaw driver. He added that his five-year-old niece was kidnapped near her residence on Friday at around 7am when she had left her home to buy biscuits from a nearby shop and since then her whereabouts had been unknown until her body was found in a garbage dump in a plot.

The uncle explained that unidentified persons had first kidnapped her and then murdered her after subjecting her to rape. Later, they set her body on fire so that she could not be identified.

A heavy contingent of the law enforcers, including police and the Rangers, reached the protest site to pacify the protesters. They held negotiations with the girl’s family and assured them of their full cooperation.

Police also told the protesters that they had arrested a suspect, Nawaz, for his alleged involvement in the incident. According to PIB Colony SHO Shakir Hsusain, the suspect’s DNA samples had been sent to a laboratory in the University of Karachi to ascertain his involvement in the crime.

The officer said police were recording the statements of the girl’s family members, relatives and neighbours and they were also trying to obtain CCTV footage. The protesters dispersed at 6pm in the evening after the law enforcers held successful negotiations with them. They, however, gave a three-day deadline to the government and police to arrest the real culprits. A case has been registered and further investigations are under way.",['Faraz Khan'],"Angered residents of the Essa Nagri area in Gulshan-e-Iqbal held an hours-long protest on Sunday on the main University Road, following the recovery of the body of an abducted minor girl who had been killed after being raped.

2023,1036,1557,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/717719-putting-an-end-to-rape,,Putting an end to rape,"\In the face of the high-profile gang-rape a few days ago, different cultural, societal, institutional, and ideological debates surfaced. These have always been imbibed in Pakistan’s national thought but as responses to such heinous criminal atrocity, these were not only unsuitable but also basically perpetuate the culture of rape.

Men took on to habitually mansplain women and the nation about rape and rape punishment on every platform: be it parliament, talk-shows, or social media. It is quite amusing and infuriating (simultaneously) to see TV panels full of men with little to none female representation discussing women’s issues and how to cope with them. A popular quick-fix was incorporated into the Twitter trend ‘Hang The Rapist’ and men of the nation decided that this will be the punishment for criminals. Our prime minister, after many days of the crime, showed up on a TV show and joined the bandwagon suggesting chemical castration as a better idea according to him.

The punishment of gang-rape is a death sentence already but the demand in recent days has been for the hanging of the rapist publically. This, of course, has nothing to do with women and what they would deem appropriate, but no one asked or cares about how women feel and what women want.

This tendency of getting excited about the idea of public hanging serves masculine tendencies of aggression. On one side, aggression is directed towards a woman and on the other, it is redirected onto an xyz rapist. Both are for male amusement. The fact that they deem women incapable of deciding for themselves is one of the supreme causes of the problem of rampant sexual crimes in the country.

Which brings us to: why men rape. Castration suggests that they do it because they have a sexual organ and if you rid them of it, they will be put to rest. However, rape doesn’t stem out of sexual needs but out of the need for power and control. In nations, the culture of misogyny and toxic masculinity breeds rape culture. Rape is just a symptom of the disease called patriarchy, misogyny, and toxic masculinity.

The major factor behind sexual assault or gender assault is inherent misogyny. Women only exist in two forms for such men, either man is the owner of a woman or a woman is a sexual object. If she is not your property, as a stranger then she is a sexual object. And when she is your property, you have all rights over her, even sexual ones. Think of incestuous rape which accounts for 82 percent of rape cases in Pakistan and remember these are highly underreported statistics. These men who rape deem women as inferiors, and even less than humans; hence by raping them, they put women into their place they have decided for them in their perception. This is why rapists have zero percent empathy for the victim because empathy is due to humans, not objects.

Rape is a depiction of power, dominance, anger, revenge all wrapped up in sexuality. Some men in patriarchal cultures rape women out of revenge because women are deemed as property, and the honour of men and families is placed in a woman’s privates.

All such instances show only one thing – the denial of woman’s agency, autonomy (also sexual), and humanity! Same is the case with the third sex. This is why only this is the antidote to rape. When you give a woman her rights given to her by the religion and the constitution, see a woman as an equal human being and not as an inferior being for your amusement or for power and control by dominating sexually, you halt rape culture. The objectification and sexualization of women aid the rape culture to stand upright. Harassment needs to be seen from women’s perspective. It may be men’s idea of fun but normalization of these ideas and habits transform into a culture of rape. Until there is a change in how men perceive a woman, no punishment is capable of terminating the rape culture.

The conviction rate of rapists is less than three percent so with this level of impunity before looking at the punishment, the system needs reforms on every level of the procedure. We need sensitive and empathetic women officials free of rape apology, victim-blaming, and shaming to provide investigative services. The police reforms that we were promised are needed badly. Even in this recent case, the role of the police has been highly questionable.

A major part totally missing in the process is the mental, psychological, and emotional help for the survivor. Judicial reforms are most desperately needed to eradicate the major factor of impunity for the abuser. Rape cases go on for years on end while the abuser is out on bail and the survivor is threatened and traumatized to forgive by police, the judiciary and family alike; also, given the high cost of legal help, cases go on for years.

The fact that there can be a compromise on such a crime is immensely problematic in itself. Many survivors kill themselves not due to the primary crime but because of the devastating aftermath that follows. It is impertinent to mention the ruthless attitude of authorities towards a traumatized human who is questioned again and again for details that are too heart-shattering for the survivor to speak about repeatedly.

Lastly, chemical castration is in no way a solution. After castrating, when the abuser is sent back into society and that too without years of psychological treatment, he will come out far more violent and this time with a purpose. A misogynistic man who has been castrated because of a woman will be many times more violent towards women than ever before. Rape is not prevented by castration.

Let’s just face it; there are no shortcuts or quick fixes to societal pandemics. As much as men would like to jeer as spectators on the sort of act of aggression they suggest such as public hanging, they need to be silent, step aside and let women come forward with their voices, and listen to understand and empathize. This is about women’s safety and only they know where and what kind of change is needed because they face harassment on a daily basis. As stated in the beginning, stop mansplaining and gaslighting women about what they need. They know their needs, rights, and voice them every day. If you wish to help end the rape culture, you need to change patriarchy and replace it with equality and misogyny with empathy. The ones who are not actively participating in the prevalence of such culture are supporting it passively by allowing it. I say: to ignore it is to allow it and to allow it is to accept it.

Sexual assault is not a natural disaster that just happens out of nowhere. A man rapes a woman or a transgender person or a child or even a male. And he rapes because the patriarchy, misogyny and culture of rape facilitate him. His intent is further strengthened and encouraged by impunity and the loopholes in the procedures respectively.

Rapes cannot be prevented without killing the rape culture and its sources. Hence, there are only three steps that help this issue. First, an end of the rape culture by an end of its sources. Second, reforms, reforms, reforms and third, prevalence of law and order, and implementation.

Tensions have been high between the ABVP and left-wing students in the university since the past 70 days owing to a strike against hike in fees.

This afternoon, the ABVP and the administration wanted to open the gates and begin registration, which led to a scuffle with the Left wing students, who are opposing the fee hike.

A professor, Atul Sood, spoke to an Indian news website and said miscreants threw huge stones at people in the campus.

""These were not small stones, these were big stones that could have broken our skulls. I fell on the side and when I came out, I saw cars completely vandalised, including my car,"" he said.

The ABVP, on the other hand, alleged that their students were being attacked inside the university by leftist students.

""Around 25 students have been seriously injured in this attack and there is no information as to the whereabouts of 11 students. Many ABVP members are being attacked in hostels and the hostels are being vandalized by the leftist goons,"" tweeted the student body.

1232,245,387,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/682094-corruption-continues-to-pervade-police-stations,,Corruption continues to pervade police stations,"Islamabad :: The question concerning the eradication of ‘Thana Culture’, probably, will remain unanswered as to how can corruption at the police station level is meaningfully curbed.

Regardless of accountability at the lower level, corruption continues to pervade the police stations, particularly of Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Police officials are caught and suspend the cops on corruption charges but are later cleared for unexplained reasons. Thus the entire action turns out to be eyewash.

Former Inspector general of Police, Zulfiqar Cheema, having immense experience of field policing, said when asked about the basic criteria of an SHO, “Two basic qualities, required for the police officers whether they command the basic unit of the police station or a district or division, are integrity and effectiveness. Some officers are honest but otherwise ineffective, they are also useless in the field of law enforcement because they can hardly contribute to the system. Some are effective but corrupt – such rogues should have no place in police stations.”

“In another political move, four parliamentary groups, consisting of members of National Assembly, Senate, Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhawa Assemblies to bring reforms in the police department, in presence Police Order 2002,” former IGP Zulfiqar Cheema said when asked and added that political influence in police affairs in the present system has never seen in the past, even in dictatorial regime.

The former IGP said, the Police Reforms does not go well with the political governments and politicians.

It is a hard fact that corruption at the police station level can’t be eliminated in the prevailing circumstances, even during the present government which believes in social reforms and establishing corruption-free police stations. This dream could only become a reality with effective planning, selection, and appointment of honest and professional SHOs (station house officers) and capable leadership, he concluded.

What is and what should be criteria of selection of SHO, an office that is the basic tool of combating corruption and the accomplishment of the dream of elimination of ‘Thana Culture’ which has literarily become a political slogan of every government.

Obviously, honesty with professionalism is basic quality of an SHO with extra attributes of bravery, commitment with duty, ability to deliver professionally with the investigation skill and enjoying public support having roots in the area people and finally, his accessibility to the aggrieved people. But the question is who meets the criteria having a package of these qualities in the corrupt police system.

Certainly, in the epoch of dearth of the right, when even Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) and District Management Group (DMG) officers are indulging in moral corruption, there are still many upper and lower subordinate police officials who believe in earning their bread and butter honestly but the authorities would have to pick the diamond from the filthy mud.

Most of the SHOs occupy different police stations due to their skill to maintain or develop close relations with leaders or personalities having influence in power corridors irrespective of the fact which political government is in place. It happened, even, in this regime when an established corrupt and notorious police inspector, due to the influence of a top political leader, was appointed as SHO. He was suspended on corruption charges. The interior minister took notice and removed him immediately after his appointment as SHO.

Unfortunately, police authorities of the twin-cities, haven’t yet achieved the target to hunt police officials of the ranks of inspectors and sub-inspectors (SIs) who meet the set criteria for the appointment as SHOs, the sources told The News adding that among some SIs, only one was found as an average police official meeting the set standard while the other nine were below average.

The irony is that the operational office is eliminating a few honest and upright SHOs one by one for unknown reasons after humiliating them and replacing them with ‘favourites’. A recurring common whisper is that police stations are ‘auctioned’ or ‘granted’ due to political influence without gauging the ability and efficiency of police officers. Corrective measures are required to be taken to check this trend to improve the image of police in the public eye.

Former Inspector general of police (IGP), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Nasir Khan Durrani, when contacted to seek his point of view on the subject, had said, “Though, the SHO as an individual can play a vital role but not so important to change the system. Sustainable measures are require to change the police station culture, which, obviously, is not possible with the effectual assistance and backing of the general public.”

Former IGP Islamabad, Sikandar Hayat, said when asked, “Certainly, there is no such officer having a complete package for the appointment of the key post of SHO, however, we are hounding for the officer meeting minimum criteria for the post.” The system required an operation against the corrupt SHOs to develop base for corruption-free policing, Sikandar Hayat concluded.",['Shakeel Anjum'],"Islamabad :: The question concerning the eradication of ‘Thana Culture’, probably, will remain unanswered as to how can corruption at the police station level is meaningfully curbed.

The treatment meted out to women in Pakistan is horrible. Physical assault, domestic violence, and harassment at workplaces, as well as rapes and murders have become the order of the day in Pakistan. According to global institutions, Pakistan has become the sixth country in the world where more than 1500 women are killed in the name of honor. And during the last five years, nearly 5000 cases of honor killings were reported in the country.

Though there are laws that provide legal protection to women in Pakistan, these laws are unfortunately ineffective and are not implemented at all in true letter and spirit. Given the critical situation of growing violence against women, PM Imran Khan has also decided to bring stern legislation on rape. But unless the implementation of such laws is guaranteed, it is very difficult to put an end to violence against women in Pakistan.

It was said by Engineer Asim Munir, District Board of Management of the TEVTA Faisalabad and Chiniot president. Chairing the board’s meeting, he said that unemployment was a major threat to our economic stability and we must carve out of box solutions to bring females into the national mainstream. He told that Prime Minister Imran Khan and TEVTA Chairman Ali Suleman Siddique were committed to provide maximum jobs and in order to arrest the menace of unemployment.

He said that females were most unutilised segment of our economy and we must launch projects to make them productive by equipping them with technical and vocational skills. He proposed that a pilot project could be launched in selected Rural Girls High School to impart much needed training and skills to the girl students.

He said that market driven courses could be launched in addition to the traditional courses of beautician and dress making etc. This would help young girls to get jobs or start their own businesses from their houses, he added.

He was optimistic that this pilot project would usher a new economic revolution in Faisalabad and Chiniot. Continuing, Asim Munir told that the government should also consider a proposal for the solarization of TEVTA centers to save costly thermal electricity, which was also polluting the environment. He said that the Punjab government had already decided to solarize the schools in the South Punjab and hence this facility must be extended to the other parts of the province where sunlight was available for more than 17 hours a day.

‘MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE INCREASING’: Maternal mortality rate is increasing at a much fast pace and thus reinvigorated awareness campaign is imperative to sensitize and educate the female population about their maternal issues.

It was said by Dr Samina Haq, patron-in-chief of Faisalabad Chapter of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Pakistan. She was addressing a reception hosted in honor of the newly-elected Governing Body of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Pakistan, Faisalabad.

She said that globally 830 maternal deaths were reported every day despite curable and preventable causes. She said that out of total deaths, 99pc were reported from developing countries, including Pakistan. She said that maternal deaths were much higher in the South Asian countries.

She said that immediate steps were needed to check these deaths and in this connection society will launch an awareness campaign. She said that it was our national duty to check maternal deaths by launching a joint campaign in collaboration with public and private partnership.

Unfortunately, due to the usual lack of reporting and lack of access to reporting we really can’t be sure where exactly we stand. What we do know is that the past few years have seen some of the most horrific cases come to light – from Kasur to individual cases. And now we have an alleged paedophile in Khairpur raping children. As per reports, the man – a retired schoolteacher – was allegedly raping minor students whom he tutored privately; reportedly, he was also filming his assaults. He has been arrested after photographs of him sodomising a young boy went viral on social media.

As per NGOs estimations, a total of 2,846 child abuse cases were reported from across the country in 2019, with data showing that more than eight children suffered some form of abuse every day in Pakistan last year. The true number must be a magnitude higher since most cases of child harassment, molestation and rape go unreported. We only hear of a fraction of these cases, but we need to wake up to the fact that child abuse is a daily occurrence and that it often leads to murder. The fact also is that those who are economically vulnerable do not have the option to always be around for their children, no matter how much they might want to, because they are struggling to make a living and feed their families. And this is why those who are economically insecure make for the easiest targets because of their circumstances, something all predators know.

Unfortunately, Pakistan maintains no registry of child sex offenders. There is also no exchange of data between police, the FIA and other security bodies. Given that the rate of sexual abuse continues to increase, concrete measures are required to address such loopholes and also initiate a system under which sex offenders can be identified and their movement monitored. In other countries for example serial offenders guilty of molesting children, must report in regularly to police, even after completing any prison sentence, and are not permitted to work in any environment where they have easy access to children, such as schools or orphanages. We also desperately need a society that is open to an honest conversation around sexual abuse. That can only happen when we stop brushing everything under the carpet in the name of propriety and ‘decency’.",[],"In a country where morality seems to rule every single second of every single person’s life, the rate of child sexual abuse seems blindingly high.

The teenager was identified as Areeba, daughter of Asif, and was a grade nine student at the Happy Palace School, Girls Campus, near Ayesha Manzil. The police team reached the school and initiated investigation into the case. An inquiry committee was also formed to investigate the incident by the education department.

According to school management, apparently the teenager’s foot twisted while she was climbing the six-step stairs after which she fell. According to the school, Areeba was rushed to a private hospital where she succumbed to her injuries. Later, the body was shifted to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital.

The family of the deceased student alleged that the teenager passed away due to the negligence of the school management and that the management did not take their child to hospital. They did not inform them of the situation.

The Sindh Education Minister, Saeed Ghani, has sought a report of the incident from DG Private Schools Mansoob Siddique. “The tragedy should be thoroughly investigated,” Ghani directed, inquiring as to why the school administration did not take the girl to hospital immediately after the accident.

No case was registered till the filing of this news story as the parents of the deceased girl reportedly refused to take any action against the school management. The schools, colleges and universities across Pakistan reopened today after six months. The schools were closed in March following emergence of COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier on August, 2019, in a tragic incident, a Grade VI student Zeeshan Durrani drowned in the swimming pool of his school during a swimming class. A case of ‘Qatl-e-Khata’ was registered against the instructors and the school management. Eleven-year-old Usman, son of Zeeshan Durrani, was a Grade VI student of the Habib Public School.

Also on October 2018, a class-seven student died after falling off from the second floor of his school in Block-17 of Gulberg. Police said that 11-year-old Habibullah Ismail fell from the second floor mysteriously. He was taken to the Ziauddin Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. His parents insisted that someone had pushed their child him from the second floor and refused the school version that he had jumped from there. They held the school administration responsible for the incident.",['Faraz Khan'],"According to school management, apparently the teenager’s foot twisted while she was climbing the six-step stairs after which she fell.

Myka Stauffer recently broke silence and came out about her side of the story after the ‘rehoming’ of her son Huxley was made public.

Although Myka and her husband initially stayed silent over the allegations, they appear to have broken their silence in an Instagram post aimed to quell any rumors of using him for profit.

Taking to her Instagram, she began by saying, “I want to first off apologize for the uproar and take full responsibility for all of the hurt that I have caused,” she wrote.

“This decision has caused so many people heart break and I’m sorry for letting down so many women that looked up to me as a mother. I’m sorry for the confusion, and pain I have caused, and I am sorry for not being able to tell more of my story from the beginning. I could have never anticipated the incidents which occurred on a private level to ever have happened, and I was trying my best to navigate the hardest thing I have ever been through. [sic]”

She later went on to say, “I apologize for being so naive when I started the adoption process, I was not selective or fully equipped or prepared. I received one day of watching at home online video training and gained my Hague adoption certification which was required by my accredited adoption agency. For me, I needed more training. I can’t say I wish this never happened because I’m still so glad Huxley is here and getting all of the help he needs.

“I also know that even though he is happier in his new home and doing better that he still experienced trauma and I’m sorry, no adoptee deserves any more trauma. I wanted to help so bad I was willing to bring home any child that needed me. For this I was naive, foolish, and arrogant. [sic]”

1488,501,765,https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/659101-inspirational-story-of-blind-pakistani-girl-whos-stormed-to-britains-got-talent,,Inspirational story of blind British Pakistani girl who's stormed to Britain's Got Talent,"LONDON: A 14-year-old British Pakistani girl who lost sight at the age of 10 has become a huge sensation in ITV's famous hit show - Britain's Got Talent – hoping to make it to the final of the popular show.

Sirine Jahnagir, who is the only contestant of Pakistani origin on the hit show, is the granddaughter of Sahibzada Jahangir, who presently serves as Prime Minister Imran Khan’s spokesperson on Trade & Investment in UK & Europe. Fauzia Kasuri is Sirin’s aunt and the late pop and nasheed singer Junaid Jamshed was her uncle.

Sirine has become an instant hit after outperforming her rivals through her amazing music performances – and winning approval from judges Simon Cowell, Alesha Dixon, Amanda Holden and David Walliams.

Sirine was born in 2005 in London. Until the age of five, she excelled in everything including sports, with dancing being her favourite pastime. Her family discovered when Sirine was five years old that she had lost her vision totally in one eye and although the other eye was perfect, there was a danger it may deteriorate.

Over time, the worst fears of the family were realised as Sirine lost vision slowly in her remaining good eye until the age of 10 when she lost it all.

A family friend told The News and Geo that those 5 years were very traumatic for Sirine as she could not do many things and slowly she learnt Braille and started to read books again. Her parents and family were supportive throughout this time and helped Sirine, who wanted to make it big in the world.

Her parents had to move to Mill Hill, in North London, when she reached the age of 12, as there were no secondary schools in central London that could cater to her special needs. In her new school, Sirine had access to expertise that helped her learn other skills. It was around this time that she delved into music. She learnt how to play the piano by herself and started singing and writing music.

Sirine has never looked back and her passion took her, after a gruelling process of selection, to Britain's Got Talent.

On Saturday, she will appear in the audition stages of Britain's Got Talent on ITV.

When contacted by The News and Geo, Sahibzada Jahangir confirmed that Sirine would be appearing before the celebrity panel.

He said: “We are all very proud of Sirine. She is hard-working, lovely and passionate. When there is a disability in someone, Allah gifts that person with some other exceptional talent. Sirine’s parents have been exceptional in bringing her up and giving her everything she needed. She does charity work and helps others. She wants to thank Allah for what she has and for the blessings in her life.”

Kafeel Jahangir, Sirine's father, told The News and Geo that Sirine taught herself how to write, compose and play music.

“We are all very proud of Sirine. Music is her passion and Britain will give her the right platform to share her music with others. She is very excited. She did the auditions by herself for BGT. One day she told me to come along with her. I went along and was shocked that she was performing before 3,000 people. She taught herself how to play music.”

Kafeel said that during his trips to the UK, the late Junaid Jamshed used to sing with Sirine and teach her about music.

Sirine uses music and her story to inspire other people with disabilities. Every Monday she goes to a school and teaches a young 6-year-old boy who has the same condition as her and she teaches him Braille and gives him confidence in seeing the future and believing he can do anything as well.",[],"LONDON: A 14-year-old British Pakistani girl who lost sight at the age of 10 has become a huge sensation in ITV's famous hit show - Britain's Got Talent – hoping to make it to the final of the popular show.
Over time, the worst fears of the family were realised as Sirine lost vision slowly in her remaining good eye until the age of 10 when she lost it all.
Her parents and family were supportive throughout this time and helped Sirine, who wanted to make it big in the world.
Sirine has never looked back and her passion took her, after a gruelling process of selection, to Britain's Got Talent.
On Saturday, she will appear in the audition stages of Britain's Got Talent on ITV.","['sirine', 'whos', 'london', 'girl', 'british', 'britains', 'pakistani', 'family', 'parents', 'inspirational',

The intention was expressed by the provincial government’s spokesman, Barrister Murtaza Wahab, during a meeting of the Senate’s Special Committee on Forced Conversions on Thursday, with Senator Anwaarul Haq Kakar in chair.

In November 2016 the PA had passed the Sindh Criminal Law (Protection of Minorities) Bill 2016 to criminalise the act of forced conversion of religion across the province.

The then governor Justice (retd) Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui, however, returned the bill to the House without his assent after some religious parties voiced their objections to the newly passed law.

The PA never got the opportunity to reconsider the bill to remove the governor’s objections. The most controversial clause of the bill had turned out to be the one about the prohibition of religious conversion of a person who seeks it before attaining the minimum age of 18 years.

Addressing the meeting of the Senate’s special committee, Wahab said the government had consulted with all the relevant political parties before the PA had passed the bill against forced religious conversions.

He said after its passage by the assembly, the bill was sent to the then governor but he returned it without his assent on the grounds that it had been passed without consulting certain religious parties. The adviser said Sindh has banned marriages of girls below 18 years. He said cases of conversions involve instances in which girls from religious minorities are taken to other provinces, where their marriages happen easily.

He said people take advantage of the fact that other provinces allow marriages of girls below 18 years. “Such incidents defame the country, so we have to work together to prevent such cases.”

Wahab said the Sindh government stands with the people of the province who belong to religious minorities, adding that the federation is also under an obligation to play its due role in this regard. “We can sit together and seek a permanent solution to this problem.”

He said no religion allows forced conversions, adding that Islam gives complete freedom to religious minorities to freely practise their respective faiths. He also said the provincial government has established a separate department to deal with the issues faced by religious minorities. The government spokesman said that a quota of five per cent in government jobs has been reserved in the province for candidates belonging to religious minorities. He said the exact number of people from religious minorities living in the province is not known to the government because the final results of the last population census are yet to be received.","['Oc', 'Our Correspondent']","The Sindh government intends to hold consultations with the relevant religious parties and clerics before it presents the bill against forced conversions in the provincial assembly once more.

The court’s decision to seek an explanation from the government on the issue comes amid growing concern about sexual violence in Bangladesh, where the penal code and domestic abuse laws do not contemplate marital rape as a crime, a British wire service reported. Campaigners, who say current legislation discriminates against married women and girls, welcomed the court’s ruling. “We think this is very much a step in the right direction,” said Sara Hossain, from the Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust, one of several rights groups that filed a writ petition with the High Court. “We told the court that Pakistan, Nepal and India have changed their laws. The law for us also has to be in accordance with equality,” she said, adding that the group would seek a final ruling from the court after the government responds. The Deputy Attorney General representing the government at the hearing declined to comment on the court’s request, but confirmed that it had been issued on Tuesday. Last month, the government changed the law to expand the use of the death penalty in rape cases following protests triggered by an online video showing a group of men sexually assaulting a woman. Women’s rights advocates said the tougher penalties would not be enough to tackle increasing rape cases, demanding far-reaching reform of the legal system and more education to bring about real change. Nearly 1,000 sexual crimes were reported between January and September, including more than 200 gang rapes, according to human rights group Ain-o- Salish Kendra. A national survey by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics in 2015 found that at least 27% of the 20,000 married women surveyed had experienced sexual violence by their husbands.",['News Report'],"DHAKA: Bangladesh’s High Court has questioned a ban on marital rape prosecutions after women’s rights groups argued it was discriminatory to stop alleged rapists from being charged if they are married to their victims, activists said on Tuesday.

A national survey by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics in 2015 found that at least 27% of the 20,000 married women surveyed had experienced sexual violence by their husbands.","['group', 'questions', 'sexual', 'high', 'bd', 'prosecutions', 'married', 'courts', 'ban', 'bangladesh', 'women', 'womens', 'rape', 'rights', 'court', 'marital']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/700X390_thenews.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-11/ss_756866_073204_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-11/ss_756867_073745_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'BD high court questions ban on marital rape prosecutions | Pakistan | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'DHAKA: Bangladesh’s High Court has questioned a ban on marital rape prosecutions after women’s rights groups argued it was discriminatory to stop alleged rapists from being charged if...', 'keywords': 'high,court,questions,marital,rape,prosecutions', 'fb': {'app_id': 650123461797330}, 'og': {'title': 'BD high court questions ban on marital rape prosecutions', 'image': {'identifier': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'secure_url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'width': 390}, 'description': 'DHAKA: Bangladesh’s High Court has questioned a ban on marital rape prosecutions after women’s rights groups argued it was discriminatory to stop alleged rapists from being charged if...', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/738933-bd-high-court-questions-ban-on-marital-rape-prosecutions', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@thenews_intl', 'creator': '@NRNews Report', 'title': 'BD high court questions ban on marital rape prosecutions', 'description': 'DHAKA: Bangladesh’s High Court has questioned a ban on marital rape prosecutions after women’s rights groups argued it was discriminatory to stop alleged rapists from being charged if...', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg?t=015942'}, 'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style': 'black-translucent', 'apple-mobile-web-app-title': 'The News International', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#333333', 'theme-color': '#000000'})",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,news,"November 4, 2020",2020-11-04

Injected in women every two months, cabotegravir is 89 percent more effective in preventing HIV than daily pills of PrEP, pre-exposure prophylaxis, the UNAIDS body said.

“UNAIDS has long been calling for additional, acceptable and effective HIV prevention options for women, and this could be a real game-changer,” its chief Winnie Byanyima said in a statement.

“If donors and countries invest in rolling out access of injectable PrEP to women at higher risk of HIV, new infections could be dramatically reduced.” The trial involved more than 3,200 women between 18 and 45 years old who were at higher risk of acquiring HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, in Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Eswatini, Uganda and Zimbabwe, UNAIDS said. It said expert monitors stopped the trial earlier than planned because there was “clear statistical evidence showing that the injectable medicine is more effective than a daily pill,” the body said.

It added that four women who received injections became infected with HIV, as opposed to 34 women who took the pills, with all the treatments administered in a random fashion. “The risk of HIV was ninefold lower with cabotegravir injections than with daily oral PrEP,” it said.

UNAIDS said the test results were important in boosting the fight against AIDS by offering women new ways to protect themselves beyond using daily pills, ensuring condoms are worn or abstaining from sex.

“Like with a Covid-19 vaccine, we now must work to ensure that these life-changing injections are accessible, affordable and equitably distributed to people who choose to use them,” Byanyima said.",[],"GENEVA: The new anti-retroviral therapy cabotegravir could be a “game changer” as a study shows it is many times more effective in preventing HIV in women as PrEP, the UNAIDS body said on Tuesday.

LAHORE: The police have identified the main culprit in the motorway gang-rape case with the help of DNA profiling, as well as his accomplice, and intensive raids are being conducted at various places for their arrest.



This was disclosed by Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar at a press conference here on Saturday. He was flanked by Punjab Law Minister Raja Basharat and Inspector General of Police (IGP) Inam Ghani.

The IGP told the media the accused fled from their homes when the police teams conducted raids there.

Interestingly, the CM shared all information about the suspects at the press conference against the norms of investigations to high-profile cases ‘before the arrest’ of culprits.

If one believes that the suspects are still at large, the disclosure of all particulars of suspects would facilities them to go into hiding. Senior police officers believed that the press conference was normally held at the arrest of culprits, and not at a time when they were absconding.

Sources said special teams including the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) had arrested both the accused and they would be killed in encounters soon “to award them exemplary punishment”. It would also help the Police Department avoid prosecution process in the relevant courts, a senior police officer said.

According to the official stance of the Punjab government, special police teams had launched a manhunt to apprehend the culprits after having identified them through scientific evidence.

The CM announced a reward of Rs2.5 million for those providing credible information for arrest of each culprit. He said that the identity of those bringing forward any information would be kept confidential.

“We worked day and night and launched a probe using scientific techniques. I personally monitored the progress and ordered for completion of probe expediently,"" Buzdar said.

""I want to inform you all we have succeeded in tracking down the real culprits of the heart-wrenching incident in less than 72 hours.

“I assure you that the savages, who committed the crime, will be brought to justice very soon,"" the CM vowed. Buzdar said that the culprits would be given exemplary punishment for the heinous crime.

IGP Inam Ghani said that the police have entire record of both accused – identified as Abid Ali and Waqarul Hasan – in the case.

According to the CM, seven cases, including two gang-rape cases, were registered against Abid, while two robbery cases were registered against Waqar who was released 14 days ago on bail.

""A special investigation team was constituted in which officers from the CTD, Special Branch, and an officer from the unit of violence against women were made part of the team,"" Ghani said. He said that the entire area where the incident took place was canvassed. ""Geofencing of the entire area was carried out, data was taken from the Election Commission of Pakistan, fingerprints were taken from the site, and DNA tests were conducted,"" he said. Ghani said that scientific investigation was a time-consuming process.

The chief minister cooperated with the police throughout the process and he remained in contract with the team even at night, till 1:30-2am,"" he said.

The police chief said that ultimately, on midnight of Friday and Saturday, ""through scientific evidence"", the prime suspect was identified as Abid Ali.

""Abid is a resident of Fort Abbas, district Bahawalnagar,"" he said.

""Our teams worked hard to gain information about Abid and were able to get information about his family, his prior records, his CNIC, and cell numbers.

The IGP said that after the police went through the records, they had gathered they got to know that the suspect had four cell-phone SIMs registered in his name that he used on several occasions. All of the SIMs, however, were currently non-functional.

""Ultimately, we tracked down another number — which was not registered in his name — and it proved our suspicions right. Through the number, we were able to reach his partner as well,"" he said.

The Punjab police chief added: ""We are 95% sure that the person we have tracked down is his partner as his phone signals were traced to the location of the crime at the time of the incident.""

He said that today, at 12pm, ""we were ready to raid their residences and apprehend them"", but upon reaching the locations, found that they had fled.

""The police were then able to track down the suspects' residences to Qila Sattar Shah, district Sheikhupura,"" IGP Ghani said.

""Unfortunately, despite raiding both the suspects' residences, we were not able to get hold of them,"" he added.

He said that owing to information leak in the public domain, the suspects ""were aware that the police were closing in on them"".

Speaking of Abid, IGP Ghani said the police raided his house — located in fields — in civilian clothes and a car, but he saw a vehicle stop near his house. So, Abid and his wife fled the scene.

""However, we were able to find his daughter inside the house,"" he said, adding that the police recovered his marriage certificate and other records, which helped confirm things.

""The second suspect, Waqarul Hassan, a resident of Ali Town, had also fled,"" the Punjab police chief said.

The IGP requested people to help the police catch the suspects and call on 15 to inform the police of their whereabouts. Responding to questions, he clarified that the suspects were ""not yet caught"".

Ghani said that timely assistance was not provided to the woman as Motorway police were not present in the area.

The chief minister said that to avoid any jurisdictional issues in the future, the government had decided to develop a mechanism to connect all calls to 15 so that the police's response time can be reduced.

Buzdar, responding to a question, said that the Capital City Police Officer Lahore Umar Sheikh had made an ""irrelevant"" statement and he has been served a show-cause notice.

""The IG has sent a show-cause notice to him and sought a reply in seven days. After he responds, legal action will be taken,"" Buzdar said.

CCPO Sheikh had blamed the victim for using an unsafe route and said that she should have checked her petrol tank before getting on the said route.

On Wednesday night, it was reported that two robbers had allegedly gang-raped a mother of two on the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway in an area falling within Gujjarpura police jurisdiction.

Meanwhile, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been trying to trace a truck from which a person approached the Gujjarpura rape victim from the opposite side and tried to ask the reason for parking the car on the roadside.

It is learnt that the truck coming from Gujranwala stopped on seeing the parked car on the opposite side. A person from the truck approached the car and tried to ask the woman about the issue she was facing. The woman didn’t open windows but told him about the petrol issue with signs. The said man opened the bonnet of the car and then left. After few minutes of his departure, two suspects reached there and committed the heinous offence.

It is worth-mentioning here that the villages and other areas of Gujjarpura police limits are safe havens for criminals. A number of incidents of crime against persons and property are reported there on a daily basis. The police have failed to control crimes in the said areas.

Ameen Abbasi adds from Bahawalpur: The main offender, Abid Ali, earlier lived in Chak 260/HR, tehsil Fort Abbas, district Bahawalnagar, where he had been wanted by the police in different heinous crimes. The cases included a gang-rape in which he and four other culprits had raped a mother and her daughter seven years ago and later reconciliation was reached between the victims and the culprits because the victim family was pressurised.

Abid Ali had been absconder because Bahawalnagar district police had registered seven more FIRs in different police stations; however, Bahawalnagar district police could never take any strict action against him.

The Bahawalnagar district police did not provide any details about the accused despite various calls made by the correspondent.

District police spokesman said that Abid Ali had left the area seven years ago after a reconciliation was reached with the victims in gang-rape case and no other record against the culprit existed.

Nevertheless this correspondent collected reliable information about Abid Ali which confirmed the fact that he had been involved in almost seven heinous crimes including robberies, which the district police seem to be hiding from the media.",['Arshad Dogar'],"Gang-rape on motorway: ‘Culprits’ clues confirmed, evading arrest for nowLAHORE: The police have identified the main culprit in the motorway gang-rape case with the help of DNA profiling, as well as his accomplice, and intensive raids are being conducted at various places for their arrest.

1936,949,1418,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/674504-what-hampered-implementation-of-police-order-2002,,What hampered implementation of Police Order 2002,"Islamabad : For the first time in the history of Pakistan a serious effort was made back in 2001 to get rid of the colonial Police Act introduced by the British back in 1861, which was basically to suppress the local people and enslave them.

The same 1861 Police Act was adopted by Pakistan after independence in 1947. So, effectively, despite getting independence after a long political and legal struggle, people of Pakistan were still being controlled through the cruel Colonial Police Act 1861.

In 2001 a serious effort was initiated to change the situation and bring about a more conducive and effective policing system for which a four-member think tank, headed by former Inspector-General of Police Afzal Ali Shigri, along with former Inspector-General Dr Shuaib Suddle, former Inspector-General (Punjab) Qazi Zulfiqar and a London-based expert, Z.U. Khan was established under National Reconstruction Bureau (NRB), which started deliberations and finalized the Police Order 2002.

The idea was to establish ‘Police Commissionerate’ with greater administrative powers to impose the law in an effective manner. Basically, it was to be more independent in its operations and work beyond the cover of the ‘Pakistan Administrative Service’ or the ‘District Management Group’ comprising assistant commissioners, the deputy commissioners and the commissioners.

The government of the time tried to implement this ‘Police Order 2002’, but for one reason or the other it could never be implemented in full. The question still remain unanswered as to which were the circumstances, or who were the prime and powerful hurdles in the implementation of Police Order 2002 for the last 18 year, even during the military regime as well as during the civil democracy?

Afzal Ali Shigri, a respectable name in the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) and author of the Police Order 2002, when questioned by this correspondent, said, mainly politicians were not in favour of implementing the Police Reforms.

“Not only politicians and Pakistan Administration Service (PAS) group showed resentment against the Police Order 2002, but some top police officers were also against the police reforms,” former IGP Afzal Ali Shigri said, adding that one of the IGP Punjab openly expressed his bitterness against the Police Order before the High Court.

It was mentioned in the ‘Police Order 2002’ that Police, being the lead agency in maintenance of internal security is yet to be reformed, despite transient of four regimes – Musharraf, PPP, PML-N and now PTI – but the previous governments have botched implementing Police Order 2002 in Islamabad Capital Territory.

There has always been conflict between police and Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) which used to gobble-up energy and resources of both the institutions.

It was believed that the PAS remained the main resistance in the implementation of the ‘Police Order 2002’, the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) officers orate, the PAS officers occupy prime positions in the government set up to govern the system.

Under the PAS administrative system, the initiatives of police officers were controlled and institutional growth of police was hindered. The system was also abusive of age old principle of responsibility with authority as a deputy commissioner enjoys supervision over the police force but when something goes wrong, only the police officers would bear the brunt.

Almost 18 years have lapsed but the ‘Police Order 2002’ has yet to come of age in Islamabad and is still awaiting its proper implementation by the provinces and the federal government. The piece of law was promulgated in order to repeal the draconian Police Act of 1861. However, as mentioned in the Crisis Group report, police reforms were sacrificed for political expediency.

Unfortunately, Pakistan lagged behind because of resistance from vested interest groups to preserve their colonial powers.

Almost 18 years have lapsed but the ‘Police Order 2002’ has yet to come of age in Islamabad and is still awaiting its proper implementation by the provinces and the federal government.","['implementation', 'shigri', 'hampered', 'pakistan', 'pas', 'administrative', 'system', 'order', '2002', 'service', 'officers', 'act']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/700X390_thenews.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'What hampered implementation of Police Order 2002 | Islamabad | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'Islamabad : For the first time in the history of Pakistan a serious effort was made back in 2001 to get rid of the colonial Police Act introduced by the British back in 1861, which was basically to...', 'keywords': 'hampered,implementation,police,order,2002', 'fb': {'app_id': 650123461797330}, 'og': {'title': 'What hampered implementation of Police Order 2002', 'image': {'identifier': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'secure_url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'width': 390}, 'description': 'Islamabad : For the first time in the history of Pakistan a serious effort was made back in 2001 to get rid of the colonial Police Act introduced by the British back in 1861, which was basically to...', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/674504-what-hampered-implementation-of-police-order-2002', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@thenews_intl', 'creator': '@SAShakeel Anjum', 'title': 'What hampered implementation of Police Order 2002', 'description': 'Islamabad : For the first time in the history of Pakistan a serious effort was made back in 2001 to get rid of the colonial Police Act introduced by the British back in 1861, which was basically to...', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg?t=015450'}, 'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style': 'black-translucent', 'apple-mobile-web-app-title': 'The News International', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#333333', 'theme-color': '#000000'})",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,news,"June 19, 2020",2020-06-19

The wing will keep record of the statistics of incidents of heinous crimes and terrorism and suggest strategies. The initial focus will be on child abuse following a series of incidents of rape and murder of minors across the country in the last many months.

Besides, it would conduct field studies to find challenges to the police force in the newly-merged districts, evaluate and modernise police welfare system, keep a check on the conduct of the police personnel, involve more and modern technology in policing and make workable recommendations for the capacity building of the station house officers, moharrirs and field and office staff.

“Previously three offices were set up for research and analysis, including Director Research at the Counter Terrorism Department, Superintendent of Police Research and Investigation and SP Research and Analysis Special Branch. This is for the first time that a dedicated Directorate for Research and Analysis has been set up at the CPO for the entire province,” Inspector General of Police (IGP) Sanaullah Abbasi told The News.

He said the directorate would do comparative study of police system nationally and internationally, make recommendations for police reforms, extend cooperation to academic institutions, recommend modern policing techniques and more. The office of the director research and analysis has been set up at the Central Police Office (CPO) by posting Waqar Ahmad as its head. The director will work under the supervision of Additional Inspector General Headquarters and will have his own research staff.

“Understanding child abuse from social and policing perspective stands on top of the proposed subjects for research and analysis at the newly set up wing,” an official told this scribe. The official added the wing would analyze the incidents of child sexual abuse across the province to find how the crime can be stopped and perpetrators duly punished.

The director of R&A would be properly strengthened with specialized manpower, technology and other requirements in the next stage. An official informed that in Sindh, a specialised research wing is working under AIG while in Punjab a DIG is heading it. He added that under the Police Act, the IGP KP can appoint a Director Research at the CPO to improve research and analysis in the force. “The job of the directorate will be to use primary and secondary data, evaluate the system and make recommendations, conduct field studies to collect data, undertake comparative studies in specific areas to recommend best policy framework, follow recommendations from all stakeholders, and impart training to the concerned staff regarding collection of data and analsis,” said the official.

He said that the directorate would highlight the emerging issues in the KP Police, evaluate and analyze these issues strategically and identify an efficient policy framework. He added that it would also recommend evidence-based solutions for improving the societal impact of policing.",['Javed Aziz Khan'],"PESHAWAR: A special research wing has been set up in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police for research and analysis with focus on understanding child abuse from social and policing perspective.

LAHORE: Abid Malhi's father on Tuesday claimed that the prime suspect in the motorway gang rape case, surrendered himself to police, Geo News reported.



Police arrested Malhi a day ago from Faisalabad, and according to authorities, the Intelligence Bureau (IB), Special Branch of the police, and other agencies had tipped off Punjab police about the whereabouts of the suspect before they apprehended him.

However, according to the suspect's father, Malhi had called the police himself after which they arrested him from Lahore's Manga Mandi area in front of a person named Khalid Butt.

The father demanded that police release the women in his family as they had Malhi in custody now.



""Abid had expressed his wish to come home. At 6:30pm, he returned,"" his father said. ""Abid was sent to the Crime Investigation Agency's (CIA) [office] in Khalid Butt's car,"" he claimed.

On the contrary, the Inspector-General Police Inam Ghani claimed that the suspect had been arrested by police.

The motorway rape case's prime suspect had managed to evade arrest four times by escaping the clutches of Punjab police since almost a month after he allegedly committed the sexual assault.



What is the motorway rape case about?

Malhi had been on the run since September 9, when it was reported that two robbers had allegedly gang-raped a mother of three on the Lahore-Sialkot motorway in an area falling within Gujjarpura police's jurisdiction.

The woman, along with her children, was driving to Gujranwala when she was forced to stop at the Gujjarpura section of the motorway after running out of fuel, at around 1:30am.

She immediately called a relative and sent him her location. He asked her to also dial the Motorway Police helpline 130 from which she reportedly received no response.



In the meantime, two robbers reportedly approached the car, broke the window, and took the woman and her children to nearby bushes where they allegedly raped her in front of the children.

They also allegedly snatched her purse carrying Rs100,000 in cash, one bracelet, car registration papers, and three ATM cards.

2109,1122,1667,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/736492-charter-of-demands-to-ensure-protection-of-women,,Charter of demands to ensure protection of women,"LAHORE: A large number of women from a cross section of the society have taken note of rising incidents of violence against women in Pakistan, particularly the incident of gang-rape of a woman on motorway despite having called the police at least twice after her fuel ran out.

The fact that a woman in Pakistan is not safe (especially after alerting law-enforcement agencies) in a public space is not only unacceptable but is also a sickening reflection of where the society stands today, they have noted in a statement issued on Wednesday.

Around this time, news from Karachi surfaced that a young woman in Karachi was abducted in a double cabin vehicle outside a mall in Clifton by two men who took her to an apartment where they, along with a third man, raped her. The woman was dropped back to the site of her kidnapping the next morning. Most women who are subjected to violence do not report it. The conviction rate in rape and sexual assault cases is under 3pc.

This group of women has issued the following charter of demands. The signatories of this charter hail from all backgrounds.

1. Implement Article 25 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973

2. Expedite and increase recruitment of female police officers and immediately establish additional women police stations. Where women police stations cannot be immediately established, set up a woman-staffed unit at each police station nationwide

3. Remove CCPO Lahore

4. Expedite inclusion of female prosecutors and provision of adequate resources and facilities to Gender Based Violence Courts to conduct trials with use of all special protection mechanisms

5. Implement a judicial sensitization programme on dealing with victims of sexual violence and harassment

6. Conduct compulsory gender sensitization training for all civil servants, police officers and judicial officers at induction; and mandatory gender sensitization training courses must be instituted for serving officers, as part of the MCMC and NMC courses by the National School of Public Policy and the Judicial Academy (making this training a prerequisite for promotions)

7. Conduct police sensitization and training across the country on handling cases of sexual violence and harassment. Further, women police officers must be made part of all investigating teams constituted to investigate cases of sexual violence, domestic abuse or harassment. The prosecuting team in GBV cases must include at least one female prosecutor.

8. Establish one government universal access number/distress line for women countrywide

9. Prohibit the two-finger (virginity) test for all rape and gang-rape survivors

10. Mandate use of forensic evidence in all cases of sexual violence

11. Provide swift, affordable and accessible administration of justice in all rape cases in the 3-month time frame provided under the law, through constitution of women’s courts and provision of free legal aid where required

12. Hold regular and periodic gender sensitization sessions for young and senior lawyers by the Pakistan Bar Council and all provincial bar councils

13. Mandate gender sensitization training for all elected officials

14. Repeal criminal defamation law contained in PECA, under which the right to expression of survivors of sexual harassment, journalists and members of civil society is curtailed

15. Immediately remove all elected and appointed state officials that engage in victim-blaming survivors of sexual assault and implement a zero-tolerance policy for both sexual harassment and misogynistic comments and behaviour by elected and appointed officials

16. Conduct regular and effective monitoring of judiciary, police and prosecutors working on GBV cases with incentives and deterrents based on performance

17. Appoint sufficient number of female medico-legal staff to ensure Women Medico Legal Officers are available 24/7 in every district of the country

18. Make all efforts to ensure more holistic discussions on the nature of rape, consent and victim blaming, which can be achieved by state-sponsored televised programmes, advertisements, radio broadcasts, etc.

19. Immediately appoint greater number of female judges at trial level, through affirmative action, to deal with rape cases

20. Immediately change procedural law to ensure the process of reporting rape and abuse takes into account sensitivity of the situation for survivors

21. Establish state-sponsored bodies to provide psychological and physical treatment to survivors of sexual violence

22. Immediately introduce, and make compulsory, intermediate and secondary level courses highlighting legal and moral viewpoints on gender sensitisation, harassment and sexual violence",['Our Correspondent'],"This group of women has issued the following charter of demands.

1176,189,309,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/624381-assad-says-erdogan-blackmailing-europe-with-refugees,,Assad says Erdogan blackmailing Europe with refugees,"DAMASCUS: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Thursday accused his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan of blackmailing Europe by opening its borders to fleeing refugees.

""Turkey has started to send a second wave of refugees as a form of blackmail to Europe,"" Assad said in an interview with the Russia 24 channel aired on Syrian state TV. As thousands of desperate refugees gathered on Turkey’s border with European Union member Greece, some EU states and the bloc’s migration commissioner have also accused Turkey of using migrants as a bargaining chip with Brussels to get support for its operations in Syria.

A three-month-old military offensive by Damascus, which Russia has supported with air power, has shrunk Syria’s last rebel bastion and displaced close to a million people. The newly-displaced civilians are massing near the border with Turkey, which already hosts more Syrian refugees than any other country, some 3.6 million people.

The interview was broadcast as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Erdogan held talks in Moscow, a summit aimed at securing an elusive ceasefire in Syria’s rebel-held Idlib enclave.

A regime strike last month in Idlib resulted in the deaths of 34 Turkish soldiers, the heaviest loss of personnel for Ankara since its military intervention in 2016.

Turkey’s reply has been bruising, with devastating drone and rocket strikes destroying regime positions and military equipment and killing dozens of government troops.

Erdogan’s move to open the floodgates for refugees seeking to flee to Europe has sent Brussels into a panic, raising the spectre of a repeat of the 2015-2016 migrant crisis.

The Turkish president has rejected accusations he was blackmailing Europe and stressed that ""Turkey’s capacity has a limit"".

Meanwhile, with tensions growing and accusations flying between Turkey and the EU over an escalating migrant crisis, the head of Nato has warned Europe it must find a way to work with ""important ally"" Ankara.

EU members accuse Turkey of unleashing a wave of migrants for political ends, in an increasingly bitter confrontation over a new crisis on the Greek border.

Thousands have gathered on the Turkey-Greece frontier since President Recep Tayyip Erdogan gave migrants the green light to leave for Europe last week, as he seeks more support from the international community in Syria.

The drama prompted a bitter tirade against Ankara from French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian, who told lawmakers in Paris it was time for a ""frank debate"" at Nato about whose side Turkey was on.

But, in an interview with AFP, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called for a more pragmatic approach, saying the European Union would have to find a way to cooperate with Ankara.

""We have to understand that when you speak about the migrant and refugee crisis we speak about a common challenge, which we have to address together,"" Stoltenberg said.

""The only way to address the situation on the border is by working together."" There was support for this view from Norbert Roettgen, chair of the foreign affairs committee in the German parliament and a contender to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel.

""We have to face the reality and if you want to help the refugees you have to cooperate with Turkey,"" Roettgen said at the Institut Montaigne in Paris, calling for a dose of realpolitik.

""I cannot see a strategy without Turkey. Face the reality, it might not delight you but Turkey is the border state between Europe and the Middle East.""

The migrant drama began after Russian-backed Syrian forces killed 34 Turkish troops in northern Syria, prompting Erdogan to seek greater assistance from allies -- both military and to support 3.7 million refugees and migrants currently hosted in Turkey.

France is one of a number of Nato members exasperated by Turkey’s actions in recent months and years -- including its unilateral incursion into Syria to fight Kurdish militias that had been important allies for the anti-Islamic State coalition.

At the French Senate on Wednesday, le Drian reeled off a list of ""ambiguities"" in Turkey’s actions, including its growing closeness to Moscow, its controversial territorial claims in the eastern Mediterranean and the migrant ""blackmail"".",[],"DAMASCUS: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Thursday accused his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan of blackmailing Europe by opening its borders to fleeing refugees.
""Turkey has started to send a second wave of refugees as a form of blackmail to Europe,"" Assad said in an interview with the Russia 24 channel aired on Syrian state TV.
The newly-displaced civilians are massing near the border with Turkey, which already hosts more Syrian refugees than any other country, some 3.6 million people.
The Turkish president has rejected accusations he was blackmailing Europe and stressed that ""Turkey’s capacity has a limit"".
Face the reality, it might not delight you but Turkey is the border state between Europe and the Middle East.""","['europe', 'erdogan', 'nato', 'migrant', 'refugees', 'turkeys', 'blackmailing',

1208,221,351,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/749570-indian-state-outlaws-religious-conversion-by-marriage,,Indian state outlaws religious conversion by marriage,"NEW DELHI: India’s ruling Hindu nationalist party has approved legislation in the country’s most populous state that lays out a prison term of up to 10 years for anyone found guilty of using marriage to force someone to change religion, foreign media reported Wednesday.

The decree for the state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) was passed Tuesday and follows a campaign by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party against interfaith marriages. The party describes such marriages as “love jihad,” an unproven conspiracy theory used by its leaders and Hindu hard-line groups to accuse Muslim men of converting Hindu women by marriage.

Under the decree — which will become a law after its approval by the state’s governor, a formality — a couple belonging to two different religions will have to give two months’ notice to a district magistrate before getting married. The couple will be allowed to marry only if the official finds no objections. Uttar Pradesh government minister Siddharth Nath Singh said prison terms of up to 10 years would stop unlawful conversions and provide justice to women.

Uttar Pradesh is the third Indian state ruled by Modi’s party after Haryana and Madhya Pradesh to approve such legislation to check what Hindu nationalist leaders call forced and unlawful religious conversions.

Earlier, the state’s top elected leader, Yogi Aditynatah, a Hindu monk, said at a public meeting that those waging “love jihad” should either refrain from it or be prepared to die.

Amid a rising tide of Hindu nationalism in India under Modi, Hindu hard-line groups have long accused minority Muslims of taking over the country by persuading Hindu women to marry them and convert to Islam.

Although India’s constitution is secular and provides protection to all faiths, the issue of “love jihad” has gripped headlines and pitted Modi’s party leaders against secular activists.

India’s investigating agencies and courts have, however, rejected the “love jihad” theory, which many see as part of an anti-Muslim agenda by Modi’s party.

On Tuesday, a court in Uttar Pradesh heard a case of interfaith marriage and said that “interference in a personal relationship would constitute a serious encroachment into the right to freedom of choice of the two individuals.”

The court’s ruling came after a Muslim man was accused of forcibly converting his Hindu partner.

India is a predominantly Hindu country, with Muslims making up about 14% of its more than 1.3 billion people. Hindu hard-line groups also oppose conversions to Christianity and have vowed to continue trying to prevent interfaith relationships.

Critics of Modi — an avowed Hindu nationalist — say India’s tradition of diversity and secularism has come under attack since his party won power in 2014 and returned for a second term in 2019.

They accuse the party of fanning religious passions and presiding over religious intolerance and sometimes even violence. The party denies the accusation.

But an apparent mood of fear, anger and disenchantment is growing among ordinary Indian Muslims. They say Modi and his party are slowly disenfranchising them, leaving the community reckoning with a future as second-class citizens.

The new decree comes at a time when Indian politics are increasingly becoming religiously charged.

On Monday, police registered a case against two executives of online streaming service Netflix, after a leader of Modi’s party objected to scenes in the series “A Suitable Boy,” in which a Hindu girl and a Muslim boy kiss against the backdrop of what appears to be a Hindu temple.

The police complaint was registered in Madhya Pradesh state for allegedly offending the religious sentiments of Hindus.

A Netflix India spokesperson declined to comment.

Many Indians on Twitter demanded a boycott of Netflix and called for the series to be taken off the platform.

Last month, jewelry brand Tanishq withdrew an advertisement featuring a Hindu-Muslim family celebrating a baby shower from TV channels and its social media platforms, following a backlash from Hindu nationalists and Modi’s party leaders. They said the ad promoted “love jihad.”

The withdrawal of the ad drew sharp criticism from many in India and shed light on the country’s growing religious polarisation under Modi, whose party and supporters envision the country as a Hindu nation and are accused by critics of normalizing anti-Muslim sentiment.",['News Report'],"Uttar Pradesh is the third Indian state ruled by Modi’s party after Haryana and Madhya Pradesh to approve such legislation to check what Hindu nationalist leaders call forced and unlawful religious conversions.

The two suspects arrested by the police have been identified as Ishaq and Achar, while the prime suspect, namely Ilmuddin, is yet to be caught. Ishaq and Achar were nabbed by the investigation wing of the Boat Basin police.

Police had earlier registered a case against the three men for allegedly subjecting a 15-year-old boy to sexual assault for two consecutive days. The FIR had been registered after the boy’s uncle approached the Boat Basin police station and complained about his nephew’s gang rape.

The uncle claimed that Ilmuddin had called his nephew to a bungalow in Clifton Block-5 with the promise of providing him a job. After the boy reached the house on September 17, Ilmuddin and two other men, namely Ishaq and Achar, repeatedly raped him that day and the next.

“After my nephew got a chance to escape from the bungalow, he ran back home and told me about his ordeal,” the uncle told the police. The officials are waiting for the boy’s medical examination report and trying to hunt down the prime suspect.

Cases of sexual assault have lately been on an apparent rise in Karachi and elsewhere in Pakistan, prompting calls for formulating stricter laws and meting out severe punishments. In the latest rape case that took place in the metropolitan city on Monday night, a young woman was allegedly gang raped in the upmarket Clifton neighbourhood. In another horrific incident earlier this month, five-year-old Marwah was kidnapped and gang raped to death by two men in Essa Nagri.

Even though Ariana Grande has a plethora of fans who have devoted their lives towards the pop sensation , there are a handful whose obsession crosses the bounds and jumps straight to being creepy.

The Thank U, Next crooner has found herself stuck in a muddle with one of her fans allegedly trespassing on her property, as per E! News.

The 26-year-old filed for a restraining order in Los Angeles on Friday while her mother Joan Grande is also in pursuit of court-ordered protection.

Police, last week, had arrested a 20-year-old individual identified as Fidel Henriquez and had booked him on felony battery and misdemeanor trespassing.

As per TMZ quoting law enforcement sources, the man had knocked on her door and had asked for her but fortunately the singer had not been home at the time and a property manager of her LA home had been the one to open the door who later called the cops on Henriquez.

A representative of the LAPD revealed to E!

1289,302,465,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/721994-police-response-to-motorway-rape-senate-panel-slams-lahore-ccpo-for-conflicting-remarks,,Police response to motorway rape: Senate panel slams Lahore CCPO for conflicting remarks,"LAHORE: The city’s top cop has once again landed himself in hot waters during a hearing of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights to talk about the motorway rape case, on Monday, Geo News reported

Lahore’s Capital City Police Officer (CCPO), Mohammad Umar Sheikh, spoke about the authorities’ response time to a distress call made by a woman when her car broke down on the M-11 Motorway on September 9, saying at one point that it was approximately 28 minutes whereas the officers who reached the site had said they did so under six minutes.

The hearing was held to discuss a gang-rape incident earlier this month when two armed men raped a woman in front of her children when she was stranded on the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway. The horrific case has led to country-wide protests and calls for reforms in laws pertaining to the perpetrators of sexual assault. In the hearing, CCPO Sheikh also said the motorway rape survivor was travelling without her husband's permission.

To which, PPP Senator Krishna Kumari Kohli — a member of the Senate committee — reprimanded him over his comment, telling him not to make any such assumptions in the future. ""Did this lady tell you?"" she asked. ""Do not make assumptions like that,"" Kishoo Bai told him when he said he had made a ""guess"". Not only that but Lahore's top cop also forgot the name of Abid Malhi, the prime suspect who has been in the wind for 20 days and whom the eight special teams — comprising personnel from all of the Punjab Police's departments — have failed to apprehend despite spotting him at least thrice across the province.

Addressing the committee members, Sheikh said: ""If [police helpline] 15 had received the call, we could have reached that place in 25 minutes. The first call to 15 was at 2:47am made by a passerby and the 15 officials reached at 3:15am."" To which, Marri said either the CCPO had no information or the committee had been misinformed.

""The call came at 2:47am and the first [Dolphin Force] officer arrived at 2:53am. I'm telling you the 100% truth,"" the CCPO responded. ""Then your cops are lying,"" Marri shot back at him.

""My job is to stop the crime and catch the culprits,"" Sheikh replied. ""Neither is there a CCTV [camera] at the toll plaza nor is an actual toll tax receipt given.

""Five technologies were used in the motorway rape case; geo-fencing, DNA filing, and fingerprint technology. Even the American police do not respond [to a crime] in six minutes"".

The committee members expressed anger over the contradiction in the police officer's statement. ""You say the police arrived at the scene in 28 minutes but the police said they had reached in six minutes,"" the committee said. ""The police tried to misguide the committee"".

When the CCPO apologised once more, Marri said: ""You don't have to apologise again and again.""

PMAP Senator Usman Kakar, also part of the committee, opined that the policeman should have been punished considering the words he had used. ""The CCPO only apologised out of fear of the court,"" Kakar said.

Sheikh told the committee that Abid's data had successfully been found from the Punjab Forensic Science Agency's (PFSA) 2013 records. ""The first case of Daniel Pearl in Pakistan was solved with [the use of] DNA,"" he said. ""If Abid was involved in 2013, why was he released,"" asked Khokhar.

The cop once again joined his hands in front of the committee in a bid to seek forgiveness. ""Babar Malhi's blood and DNA have also matched,"" he said. At which, the committee members paused, in shock, and asked: ""Babar Malhi or Abid Malhi?""

The cop responded: ""Forgive me my sister, I have joined my hands in front of you, I beg you. I am 56 years old and my memory, too, is according to my age. ""I have sought forgiveness from the committee and apologised. Let me just once stand in front of the joint meeting and I will apologise in front of everyone there.""

Upon further probing, he said: ""What if there is an outrage if I say something? I have told the chief justice who is responsible. I will introduce court-martial law in the Punjab Police.

""There are 500 people and something or the other gets leaked,"" he said of his police force. ""If it was in my power, I wouldn't spare anyone. This is what will happen to anyone who wishes to bring reforms,"" he added, referring to himself.

Speaking further on the incident, he said the inquiry number was of the motorway but the rescue vehicles come under the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO). ""In this case, too, an FWO officer was taken on the woman's conference call. He told her he would send a car. ""That car was on the M2 [motorway] and it took a long time to reach the site,"" Sheikh said. ""The crux of the matter is that this alert should have been to 15.""",['News Report'],"In the hearing, CCPO Sheikh also said the motorway rape survivor was travelling without her husband's permission.

The committee was told by the police officials that 25 teams were jointly working; the accused hace been arrested and further probe was going on. The meeting was chaired by Riaz Fatyana that was also attended by IG Motorway Kaleem Imam, Punjab additional IG and former IG Shoaib Suddle.

During the meeting, the Lahore police chief accused politicians of patronising robbers and other criminals.

CCPO Umar Sheikh claimed that a notorious criminal named Shahbaz Bhinder was found at the Dera of PML-N lawmaker Mohsin Raja.

The PML-N MNA, who is part of the committee, refuted his allegation and in turn accused the Lahore police chief of approaching him for the his appointment as a DIG.

The chairman of the committee observed that Pakistan was disgraced across the world after the Lahore motorway gang-rape incident.

“When a motorway is opened, security personnel should be deployed first and the communication ministry failed to do,” he said.

“The incident of rape on Lahore-Sialkot Motorway is sad and painful,” said IG Imam. “There is an area of 1,200 kilometres for which we have not been provided resources but are performing duties.”

Imam also added that the Motorway Police had kept bringing the issue of lack of resources in the notice of relevant authorities.

CCPO Sheikh, while briefing the committee on the incident, said the reason for the woman for travelling late at night was the pressure of returning home from her husband.

“A conference call was made with Frontier Works Organization on the complaint of the woman running out of fuel,” the CCPO said.

“Forty-five minutes after the call to helpline 130, no one reached out to help. At 2:47 pm, a passerby reported at 15 [police emergency number],” he added.

“If 15 had been called in time, the incident would not have occurred.”

The CCPO further said two best prosecutors available had been sought from the prosecutor general for the case.

He told the committee that 25 teams were working day and night to apprehend the main suspect, Abid Ali.

Fatyana said that there was one emergency helpline globally, but in Pakistan, each department had its own helpline. He recommended having one universal helpline number for the country. He also said police would have to increase the quota of women in its personnel.",[],"ISLAMABAD: National Assembly Standing Committee on Law and Justice Thursday praised Punjab police for investigating motorway rape case using latest techniques.

“The incident of rape on Lahore-Sialkot Motorway is sad and painful,” said IG Imam.","['disgraced', 'woman', 'pakistan', 'helpline', 'committee', 'world', 'accused', 'motorway', 'told', 'rape', 'ig', 'lahore', 'working', 'incident']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/700X390_thenews.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': '‘Motorway rape incident disgraced Pakistan across world’ | Top Story | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'ISLAMABAD: National Assembly Standing Committee on Law and Justice Thursday praised Punjab police for investigating motorway rape case using latest techniques.The committee was told by the police...', 'keywords': 'motorway,rape,incident,disgraced,pakistan,world', 'fb': {'app_id': 650123461797330}, 'og': {'title': '‘Motorway rape incident disgraced Pakistan across world’', 'image': {'identifier': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'secure_url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'width': 390}, 'description': 'ISLAMABAD: National Assembly Standing Committee on Law and Justice Thursday praised Punjab police for investigating motorway rape case using latest techniques.The committee was told by the police...', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/719923-motorway-rape-incident-disgraced-pakistan-across-world', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@thenews_intl', 'creator': '@AAgencies', 'title': '‘Motorway rape incident disgraced Pakistan across world’', 'description': 'ISLAMABAD: National Assembly Standing Committee on Law and Justice Thursday praised Punjab police for investigating motorway rape case using latest techniques.The committee was told by the police...', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg?t=015749'}, 'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style': 'black-translucent', 'apple-mobile-web-app-title': 'The News International', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#333333', 'theme-color': '#000000'})",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,news,"September 25, 2020",2020-09-25

Last month, the four-year-old boy, Tahirullah, was found dead in the fields of Telaband in the limits of the Badaber Police Station. Though his abdomen was cut, no organ was removed as wrongly reported in sections of the media.

However, the incident caused fear in the area as well as in nearby towns. Five days later, a young girl was first killed and then her charred body was set on fire in Balokhel area of Badaber.

""As many as 30 suspects were arrested and questioned earlier. One of them has been identified to be the main accused. He is at large but efforts are underway to arrest him soon,"" said Superintendent of Police (SP), Saddar, Waqar Ahmad.

1315,328,504,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/674931-blackmail-indecision-and-breach-of-contract,,"Blackmail, indecision and breach of contract","LAHORE: There is a disconnection when we look at the state, and trade and industry, despite the fact that this government has interacted with the businesses much more than the previous regimes. The problem arises when government fails to act on agreed points.

In many cases, the government fully understands the impracticality of its decisions, but continues with those impracticable decisions. In some cases, the government is convinced that Pakistan having a full database of its citizen has the ability to document the entire economy, but feels constrained to implement this concept by linking all economic transactions with the CNIC numbers of buyers and sellers.

Government fails to even act on issues where businesses and state are on one page. It is reluctant to act on issues necessary for improving tax compliance fearing traders’ agitation.

Even before coming to power the ruling party assured the exporters that they would be provided gas and power at regionally competitive rates on long-term basis. After assuming power, the government announced to provide five exporting sectors a competitive power and gas tariff for six months.

The economic team never realised that exporters could never benefit from such benefit on short-term basis. When they negotiate the export deal they execute in four to eight months. They cannot evaluate their cost on a short-term concession.

This fact was made known to the economic planners in various meetings and they understood the underlying problem. Still next three energy and tariff concessions were again announced on six monthly bases. In the next budget the tariff concession has not been announced (as it requires subsidy).

At least exporters should have been informed that a policy was being drawn. However, exporters are also agitating for point scoring only. After steep decline in rupee value the electricity tariff is already in line with the regional power tariff. The cost of imported gas is also much lower than the cost of locally supplied gas.

Exporters this time around are facing the problems of declining demand in the global markets. No concessions would boost the demand.

Moreover, highly devalued rupee was so advantageous for our exporters that the Indians were finally forced to devalue their rupee as well. Still, during the PML-N regime one Indian rupee was equivalent to Rs1.70 Pakistani rupees.

Now one Indian rupee is equivalent to 2.10 Pakistani rupees. Our exporters have failed to take advantage of high devaluation.

Economic planners do not have the courage to confront the exporters lobby and insist that they enhance their efficiencies instead of pressing the government for further concessions.

Another contentious issue between the government and the businesses is that of CNIC. The government last year decided in principle to document all purchases from retailers through CNIC.

All retailers were asked to provide the CNIC number of all purchases above Rs25,000. The traders and even the industry agitated.

The matter was first deferred for one month, then two months and finally for six months. After lengthy negotiations, it was notified that from January 1, 2020 all purchases above Rs50,000 would be documented through the CNIC of the buyer.

The notification was not fully implemented by the time Covid-19 hit the economy. Traders started agitating that the demand has declined after pandemic and buyers are not ready to provide their CNIC.

Now in the budget for the next year it was announced that the CNIC number of the purchaser would be mandatory on purchase of goods or services worth Rs100,000 or above. Traders again are opposing it.

They know that they can exert pressure on the government and defer its implementation indefinitely.

All this is happening at a time when we are hard pressed for revenues; when we are desperate to enhance our productivity; when businesses need hand holding from the state to move on from depression to growth.

The government has never adopted a principled stance. It is always prone to pressure from vested interests.

Economy and growth are triggered through prudent policies of the state. A government has to exert its writ particularly in cases where it is convinced that it would benefit the nation and the economy in the long run.

It should be prepared to face short-term agitations instead of giving in to its justified stance. This could only be done by a leader who has confidence in his/her ability.",['Mansoor Ahmad'],"Government fails to even act on issues where businesses and state are on one page.

1754,767,1148,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/610201-police-investigation-is-entry-point-in-criminal-justice-system,,Police investigation is entry point in criminal justice system,"Islamabad : Police are the entry point in the criminal justice system and a door for access to justice. If its core function of investigation is compromised due to political interference, vested interest or corruption coupled with inefficiency, it will surely lead to miscarriage of justice at the door, a experienced police officer, believes in scientific investigation, averred.

A serving senior police officer, while talking to ‘The News’, on the condition of anonymity, conceded that there probably are thousands of innocent individuals, both men and women, young and old, who somehow got implicated in some acts of crime and have been handed out different sentences, even from death to life imprisonment or other terms, only because of flawed investigations.

“We need to hire crime investigation experts who should be trained on scientific lines, using latest forensic sciences for collecting evidence to corroborate the facts in any crime. Similarly, for interrogation purposes we need to hire psychologists and psychiatrists to engage with the alleged criminals instead of using ‘third degree’ tactics,” he added.

“We have seen quite experienced young investigators, who wanted to carry out investigations in any act of crime on scientific basis, using forensics to unveil and unearth evidences and applying human psychology with reasoning to get to the bottom of a case at hand.

“Unfortunately such investigators could not sustain long and with the passage of time, abandoned their actual skills and started following the notorious police investigations prevailing in our police stations since colonial times,” the senior police officer said.

“The traditional practice of investigation is to resort to blackmailing in the form of detention of the close relatives of any alleged criminal and even if it does not work the inhuman violence is what the investigators employ to extract confessional statements,” the police officer supervising the investigation section of the Punjab police department, said, adding that a notable number of inexperienced lot of young investigators, misusing their offices, are practicing old tradition of investigation and misguiding the courts of justice.

As a result, an accused, an overwhelming majority of whom are poor, uneducated individuals, ends up as a ‘proven’ criminal and handed out convictions which range from death by hanging by the neck till death, life imprisonments or other sentences to be served in confinement of jails for years and years for a crime that they have never committed.

There are thousands and thousands of such victims lodged in jails all over the country, awaiting the government to make some meaningful amendments in the prevailing laws, which may help them prove their innocence and get their freedom.

Meanwhile, the former Inspector-General of Police of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Nasir Khan Durrani, pointed out that another major corrupt practice to influence investigations is bribe. “This bribe could start with thou sands of rupees and may end up in multi millions, depending on the severity of case. This financial corruption has frequently impacted investigations, leading to flawed evidence which eventually ends up in weak prosecution,” the former IGP said.

He said that the system of review and revision in the criminal justice system during the course of investigation need to be improved.

“The top most priority of the government should be to change ‘Police Culture’, this ‘Thana-Kutchery culture’ (Police Station and Court culture), completely revamp the police investigation system and separate it from the police department, hire investigation specialists who are abreast with the modern and scientific means and manners of crime investigation and continue training more and more crime investigators in the country,” Nasir Khan Durrani said.

He pointed out that at present the ‘First Information Report’ (FIR) in any case is considered to be the complete case file by the police as well as the judiciary. “This is wrong. The FIR should be considered only as the initial report. At present a whole case is built on the FIR and the changes made in it eventually make the whole thing suspicious. And the courts also consider these FIRs as the basis of any case and because of the faulty investigations the case ends up in a flawed decision,” he said.

About the ‘eye witnesses’ in any case, he said, there is a big importance of eye witness or eye witnesses in any case all over the world. “But the statement of an eye witness or eye witnesses should be brief and authentic in which he or she should narrate only what he or she has seen with his or her own eyes,” he said.

“But in our ‘kutchery and court’ system is overwhelmingly powerful and the touts and mafias have dug their claws too deep in this rotten system. They are openly buying fake professional witnesses who are very well trained to give evidence in the court of law under oath and the judges have no option but to believe their statements and make decision on the basis of those,” the former IGP said.

Another issue, he added, is the credibility of ‘Dying Declaration’, a statement given by a victim just before his or her death. “Usually these ‘Dying Declarations’ are declared not credible on the basis that the dying person could have wrongly implicated somebody for his or her enmity.

Yet another issue is the confessional statements extracted by the use of violence or harassment. “Almost always such statements given by any alleged culprit are denied in the court of law and are set aside by the court as an account taken under duress. So, these are just a few factors, a few of the major factors in fact, which are crippling our investigation and legal system and need to be paid immediate attention with more steps to be introduced for gradual change in the long run,” Nasir Khan Durrani said.

Deputy Inspector General of Police, Asim Gulzar, when contacted to get his belief in investigation skill, said, “Criminal investigations in Pakistan move from criminal to crime scene which ultimately leads to fabrication of evidence, forced confessions, torture and ultimately acquittals or wrong convictions”.

Investigation under Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) is defined as the “Collection of Evidence” which in turn requires use of scientific tools and latest techniques, the DIG maintained.

In order to improve investigations, police must shift its focus on crime scene and use scientific methods, ensure chain of custody procedures and secure he evidence to identify the criminal, Asim Gulzar added.

It is high time that investigative function shall be further developed and only certified investigators must be deputed by law to investigate the cases and in case of motivated or wrong arrests, the investigation officer and the department must face the civil damages suits, he concluded.",['Shakeel Anjum'],"Islamabad : Police are the entry point in the criminal justice system and a door for access to justice.

Queen Elizabeth II, who is reportedly set to step down and hand over the throne to her son Prince Charles next year, had allegedly spotted ghost at Windsor Castle, a royal residence at Windsor.



Windsor Castle is strongly associated with the English and succeeding British royal family, and embodies almost 1,000 years of architectural history.

The Castle has made headlines in recent years for hosting royal weddings as well.

According to a report by House Beautiful, Windsor Castle also hosts as many as 25 ghosts that included King Henry VIII and King George III.

According to the report, Queen Elizabeth II and her sister Margaret had allegedly spotted the ghost of Elizabeth I in the library of the Windsor Castle.

The same report says the ghost of George III has also been spotted in the room below the library of the castle.

Meanwhile, Queen Elizabeth will reportedly 'step down next year' and hand over the British throne to the heir next in line, her son Prince Charles when she reaches the age of 95, a royal biographer has claimed.

Royal biographer Robert Jobson said: 'I still firmly believe when the Queen becomes 95, that she will step down.'",[],"Queen Elizabeth, her sister Margaret allegedly spotted ghosts in Windsor CastleQueen Elizabeth II, who is reportedly set to step down and hand over the throne to her son Prince Charles next year, had allegedly spotted ghost at Windsor Castle, a royal residence at Windsor.

2037,1050,1578,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/643458-mohr-prepares-policy-paper-on-gender-impact-of-covid-19,,MoHR prepares policy paper on gender impact of COVID-19,"Islamabad : COVID-19 response must take the specific needs and vulnerabilities of women into consideration as women, who already face many hurdles in accessing health care, are likely to have heightened exposure to the virus as the burden of caring for the ill often falls on them.

The implications of COVID-19 on women and possible solutions are highlighted in a policy brief prepared by the Ministry of Human Rights, in collaboration with UN Women and National Commission on the Status of Women (NSCW). The recently released policy brief explores the “Gendered Impact and Implications of Covid19 in Pakistan.” The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the specific vulnerabilities that women and girls face in lieu of the Coronavirus as well as broad policy recommendations to mitigate immediate risks and prevent the exacerbation of existing gender gaps.

The brief says that prolonged school closures due to Covid-19 are adversely effecting education and could exacerbate gender inequalities in educational attainment. It also highlights the importance of encouraging women to visit hospitals and clinics for pre and postnatal checkups as well as keeping them informed about prevention protocols and the conditions in which they should seek medical help and care in order to avoid complications during delivery.

With regard to strong evidence that suggests that emergency measures instituted to cope with epidemics increases the risk of domestic abuse, the brief recommends that gender-based violence services are integrated in response efforts as essential services.

The brief also highlights the importance of including female leadership in policy making and response efforts. Representation from women commissions and women development departments should be ensured in decision-making bodies and gender parity should be promoted in recruitment of staff and volunteers for COVID-19 response teams.

The policy document reminds stakeholders of the dire need to generate sex disaggregated data and primary micro-level research required for effective policy making. It says that lack of disaggregated data hinders targeted and effective relief response in times of crisis and humanitarian emergency.

The brief mainly delves into the larger political, social and economic impacts of Covid-19 and presents an analysis of the potentially disproportionate impact on women and girls with a focus on 6 key thematic areas: education, health, labour force participation, time use and mobility, financial empowerment, and gender-based violence.

The policy brief emphasizes reducing the impact on girls’ education through ‘tele-school initiatives’ and increased public and private partnerships to develop learning content and increase accessibility of learning materials to children through computers, televisions and smart phones. Moreover, it outlines specific measures that could be utilized to encourage girls in rural areas to return to school once the situation normalizes.

Another important policy recommendation contained in the brief is that of ensuring the continuation of basic and reproductive health services for women. It also highlights the importance of devising mechanisms for providing regular support to the more vulnerable segments of the labour market and building economic resilience amongst women.

It says that most women in the labour force are part of the informal low wage market, home based workers, or work for small and medium size enterprises and thus suffer from low income security and a lack of access to safety nets and social protection in times of crisis. It points out that targeted cash and loan programmes as well as access to financial services is a critical area of intervention to mitigate the risks and impact of Covid19 on women in Pakistan. Such efforts are already underway through the Ehsaas Programme and the PM COVID Relief Fund. The policy brief says that restriction on mobility warrant adapted solutions to GBV service provision i.e. a shift towards remote and technology-based support.

In her comments regarding the policy brief, Minister for Human Rights, Shireen Mazari, has emphasized the importance of ensuring that access to GBV services in not interrupted. “Women are more vulnerable during a lockdown because they often have to live with abusers and may find it difficult to even call for help.

The Ministry of Human Rights has ensured that our helpline and women crisis shelters remain operation during the crisis, with specific protocols in place to prevent the spread of the virus. We are also working towards ensuring that the police, health workers, and social workers are responding to the specific and critical needs of women during this time.”

Secretary for Human Rights, Rabiya Javeri Agha, has urged stakeholders to adopt a gender integrated approach to the COVID-19 response at multiple levels. “This policy brief and gender analysis should serve as an essential resource document to guide stakeholders to effectively address gender inequalities emerging in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic in Pakistan.”",['Myra Imran'],"The brief says that prolonged school closures due to Covid-19 are adversely effecting education and could exacerbate gender inequalities in educational attainment.

1539,552,845,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/625804-women-shall-have-similar-rights,,Women shall have similar rights,"Women make up half of humanity but, unfortunately attitude of many Muslims towards women is not truly Islamic; it is conservative and medieval. This attitude toward women is morally wrong and at the same time it does not meet the demands of the time.

It appears that we are very much influenced by the alien ideas with regard to women. According to one of these beliefs, Eve was the cause of the first act of disobedience and this gave rise to the concept that women are the roots of all evils. From this ‘original sin’, woman’s ‘moral degradation’ found its expression in every human thought and attitude. Christians initially subscribed to this belief, but now recognize most women’s rights because of the human rights movement, yet Muslims still follow the stories and legends of Israeliaat (Biblical stories) whereas the Quran declares that Adam and Eve, both committed the lapse ( The Quran 2:36, 7:22 and 7:23).

Islam declares unequivocally that a woman, as a human being, is equal to a man. The Holy Quran addresses both men and women in the same manner: i.e. An-Nas (O! People), Al-Insan (O! Human Beings), Al-Bashar (O! Humans) and Al-Momin (O! Believers). All these terms equally applicable to both women and men without any distinction whatsoever on the basis of gender. The Quran describes the equality of human origins: ‘O’ mankind! Reverence your Guardian-Lord, who created you from a single person’ (The Quran 4:1) and ‘O’ mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, ….Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most righteous of you’ (The Quran 49:13). Islam gives equal value to the life of women and men and emphasizes that point by defining equal punishment for a killer of either gender: ‘If a man kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell, to abide therein (For ever) (The Quran 4:93).

However, it is generally but wrongly believed in Muslim societies that men are superior to women. Adherents to this position use this verse as an excuse: ‘…but men have a degree (of advantage) over them’ (The Quran 2:228). This verse merely provides guidance to the Muslims as how to conduct their family matters. Islam considers family as a basic social unit and, therefore, Allah has defined equitable rights and obligations for both wife and husband within the sacred unit.

The words ‘men have a degree over them’, exclusively point to the responsibility of men to earn for their family.

It does not give men a license to control and mistreat women. According to the Quran, dignity belongs to human beings, both men and women, and human beings are Allah’s best creation and that is the reason

He has blessed Adam with enormous respect: ‘We have honoured the sons of Adam. (The Quran 17:70). The Quran views the birth of female children as a blessing and advises its followers that the birth of female children should not be a sad occasion for the families: ‘When news is brought to one of them, of (the birth of) a female (child), his face darkens, and he is filled with inward grief!.....? Ah! what an evil (choice) they decide on? (The Quran 16:58-59). Islam condemned the evil practice of killing female children in the pre-Islamic era. The Holy Quran reprimands the perpetrators, stating emphatically that they will be questioned for the same heinous crime on the Day of Judgment: ‘And when the female (infant) buried alive is questioned: For what sin was she killed? (81:8-9).

Islam makes seeking knowledge mandatory for both women and men. There are many Ahadith that support and motivate for female education: (i) ‘Acquisition of knowledge is obligatory for all Muslims’ (Ibn-Majah); (ii) Some women requested The Prophet (PBUH) to fix a day for them as the men were taking all his time. On that The Holy Prophet (PBUH) promised them one day for religious lessons and commandments (Bukhari, Hadith No. 101). Islam encourages Muslim women to express their views in all the matters of life, from home affairs to political organization. The Holy Quran describes a characteristic of its followers in the following words, ‘Who (conduct) their affairs by mutual consultation (42:38).

The Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) used to consult his wives on various matters and seek their opinions (Bukhari, Vol 3, Hadith No. 891). Umar (RA), the second Khalifah, once in his sermon advised not paying a big Mehar (dower gift to a bride). Hearing this a woman stood up and confronted Umar (RA) by saying when Allah wants to give us more, why are you depriving us? Did Allah not ordain in the Holy Quran, ‘Even if ye had given the latter a whole treasure for dower, take not the least bit of it back’ (4:20). Hearing this argument, Umar (RA) confessed his mistake and withdrew his orders of fixing Mehar.

Islam guarantees protection to women from false accusation and introduces exemplary punishment (Hadd) to protect their honor. The Holy Quran has declared that all women are chaste and has prohibited its followers from leveling baseless allegations. If any woman is charged with committing adultery, the man has to produce four eyewitnesses to prove his charge. If he fails to do so, he will be awarded the punishment of 80 stripes and, furthermore, he will be debarred from giving testimony forever, (The Quran 24:4). Islam protects economic rights of the women. It has given inheritance rights to women in their capacities as mother, sister, daughter and wife.

They are all entitled to get a fixed share in the properties of their ancestors (The Quran 4:7). Khadija (RA), The Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) first wife, was a famous trader of Quraish and The Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in his youth used to take her goods to foreign lands. Umm-ul-Momineen Zainab Bint-e-Jahash (RA) used to process leather and then sew different things from it to sell in the market (Nasa’i, Vol. 2, Hadith No. 1307). Islam allows the marriage of choice. A young girl once came to the Holy Prophet (PBUH) and said that her father wanted her to marry his nephew and that her father wants her to honor his decision.

The Prophet (PBUH) declared that she has a right to choose, (Bukhari and Abu Dawud). Similarly, the Holy Prophet (PBUH) sought the consent of his own daughter Fatima (RA), before her marriage to Ali (RA). The marriage proposal of Khadija (RA) to The Holy Prophet (PBUH) is yet another clear example of the right of a woman to choose her husband.

During the golden era of Muslim civilization, women participated widely and effectively in the social and cultural life of the Muslim communities. Ayshah (RA), the wife of The Prophet (PBUH), was a profound scholar and the leading companions of The Prophet (PBUH) would come to consult her on questions of jurisprudence, history and literature. Umm al-Darda (RA) delivered public lectures in the Jerusalem Mosque, which were attended even by Suleiman, Umayyad King. Imam Shafi’i, founder of one of the four leading schools of Islamic Law, was the student of Nufaysa in Cairo.

Ibn Hajar al-Asqalany, a well-known Imam in Islam, was trained, together with fifty of his co-disciples, at the school of Ayshah al-Hanbaliyah and in his ‘Biographies’ he mentions more than 1500 women jurists and scholars. Al-Suyuti devoted his ‘Nuzhah’ to the biography of 37 women poetesses. Some of the greatest scholars of Islam, such as Ibn Khallikan, al-Baghdadi and al-Zamakhshari owe much of their knowledge to their female contemporaries.

There were women who specialized in various other branches of religious sciences and literature, such as Ayshah of Damascus (grammarian and rhetoricist) and Ayesha of Jerusalem (transmitter of Hadith and teacher). Ibn Jubair, an Andalusian historian of the twelfth century of AH, reported the participation of women in debates with men of letters. In his Nafh-al-Tib, al-Maqqari, devoted a long section to women’s poetry. Grenada seems to have been the leading city of women’s literature.

The blossoming of the female genius in the arts and literature was due to the widespread social freedom enjoyed by the women of Grenada. Some of them were renowned for their talent in calligraphy, such as Lubnah and Fatima (secretaries to al-Hakam II).

Al-Marrakushi reported 170 female calligraphers in a single district of Cordoba. Since printing was not available, the art of calligraphy played an important role in the world of letters. Women also worked in the army, not only as nurses but also as genuine combatants. The historian, Ibn al-Athir, cited Safiyyah as an example of heroism. In an episode during the celebrated Battle of Yarmuk, Asma killed nine soldiers on her own.

The example of Ghazalah, who put to flight the Umayyad army of al-Hajjaj, has become proverbial. Several women are reported to have fought side by side with their husbands at the time of the Crusades in Palestine. Shajarat al-Durr was the widow of the Sultan As-Salih Ayyub (d.1249) who played a crucial role after his death during the Seventh Crusade against Egypt (1249 –1250) and became the Sultana of Egypt in 1250. Raziah was the Sultana of Delhi (1236-1240). Turkan Khatun ascended to the throne of Khurasan in the fourteenth century. At the same time, the celebrated Tanzu reigned over Persia and Iraq.

Contrary to this illustrious tradition, modern Muslims have ostracized women from the society. Women have nothing to do with the world outside. It is great injustice that Muslims have debarred women even from going to the mosque to offer regular congregational prayers and Eid prayers.

My considered view is that in the present times when humankind is awakened and vigilant, education is widespread and the Women’s Rights Movement is gathering momentum, Muslims should change their attitude as present thinking and attitude towards women are untenable. We shall accept, ‘Women Shall Have Similar Rights’, (The Quran 2:228).",['Zafarullah Khan'],"The Holy Quran addresses both men and women in the same manner: i.e.

Speaking at the inaugural workshop here, Australia’s Deputy High Commissioner to Pakistan Joanne Frederiksen said gender equality led to greater productivity and growth.

“Promoting equality and the rights of women and girls is central to Australia’s development, economic and bilateral cooperation with Pakistan.”

She said gender-based violence was a shared challenge.

“There has been an alarming increase in violence against women during the lockdowns to curb the spread of COVID-19. The role of media is important in challenging traditional social and cultural norms and attitudes that condone violence against women,” she said.

Australian journalist and advocate for gender equity, Virginia Haussegger is joining Pakistani journalists Amber Shamsi, Marvi Memon and Mehmal Sarfraz and legal expert Sara Malkhani in the workshops to share experiences about the transformative role media can play in preventing violence against women and girls.

Ms Haussegger said she applauded those, who embraced media education around violence, and congratulated the Pakistani journalists, who aimed to improve media reporting.

“Given the increasingly high rates of violence against women it is vital that we all learn to separate the myths from reality. Journalists must learn to distinguish perpetrator accountability from a victim’s actions... It is only through a better understanding of the root causes of violence and gender inequality that we can build a deeper understanding of the role every citizen must play in preventing violence against women and girls,” she said.

Trainer Amber Shamsi said whether it was through perpetuating stereotypes or victim-blaming through images, language and perspective of stories - media can often indirectly or directly legitimise violence against women.

“Sensitising media practitioners on the need to understand how to handle stories of gender-based violence, and the context of that violence, is a long and continuous process. But given some of the minor victories in Pakistan over the last few years, it is worth the effort,” she said.",['Our Correspondent'],"Islamabad : The Australian High Commission is organising online workshops for media professionals during the 16 Days of Activism to End Violence Against Women with an aim to create awareness of violence against women by encouraging gender-sensitive reporting.

Former chief justice of Pakistan had taken up the matter after the boy, Naveed Munir, had filed an application to the human rights cell of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

A three-member bench headed by Chief Justice Ch Gulzar Ahmed and comprising Justice Umar Ata Bandial and Justice Ijazul Ahsan ordered Commissioner Capt (retd) Saif Anjum to arrange passport and other travel documents of Munir so that he could go to a country of his choice for education.

The Aitchison College had rusticated Munir on allegation of perversion and the government, on previous directions of the court, got him admitted to the Divisional Public School.

A representative of the Aitchison College presented a report about the expulsion of the student, accusing him of moral turpitude which made CJP Gulzar Ahmed infuriated. “I have gone through the letters written by the principal about the student. He has accused Munir of involving in immoral activities, the CJP said.

“Do you have any proof to substantiate you allegations. Prima facie these accusations seem to be false, the CJP said to the representative of the college, adding that the institution administration had badly treated the teenage student.

Justice Umar Ata Bandial remarked that Aitchison is not the prime institution of the country as it is creating problems in the society. Its students and teachers both are stubborn. He regretted that an attempt has been made to ruin the future of the student because no other educational institution is ready to admit him.

During the hearing, the CJP also took the commissioner to task after he presented a report, suggesting that Naveed Munir was undergoing psychological treatment. The commissioner said the service of an expert psychologist has been hired who had conducted a counseling session with Munir.

Justice Bandial chided the commissioner for not taking care of the student, saying that he was appointed custodian of Munir, but he never went to see him. “Do not act like an officer in the courtroom. Have you ever asked the boy about his needs? It was your responsibility. Look after him like your own son, the CJP admonished him.

“He does not need psychology treatment. He needs love and affection and a congenial atmosphere to become a good human being, Justice Bandial said to the commissioner.

The CJP also addressed the boy and advised him to take care of himself and asked the commissioner to make all necessary preparations to send him abroad for higher education. He encouraged the boy and advised him to concentrate on his education, assuring him that he will be facilitated to go abroad for education.

Munir was living with his stepmother after the death of his father and was clueless about the whereabouts of her real mother who was divorced when he was a baby. His family had abandoned him to grab his costly properties after the death of his father and the former CJP had appointed the Lahore commissioner his guardian about one and a half years ago.",['Our Correspondent'],"LAHORE: The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Friday directed the Lahore commissioner to furnish a report regarding the mental and physical health of a 17-year-old boy who was rusticated by the Aitchison College.

988,1,2,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/626956-governor-takes-notice-of-chinese-student-s-alleged-harassment,,Governor takes notice of Chinese student’s alleged harassment,"PESHAWAR: The alleged sexual harassment of a Chinese student at the University of Malakand by no one else but her own teacher has taken a serious turn as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Shah Farman Khan took notice and ordered an inquiry into the matter.

The story about alleged harassment of the foreign student had appeared in The News last week. A Chinese student Ms Zhou Min had lodged a complaint against her teacher Qaiser Khan, chairman of the Department of English, accusing him of sexually harassing her.

The complaint had been made through an email. Spokesman for the University Fida Khan confirmed: “The complaint had been made from an unofficial email to an unofficial email.”

He said that a five-member committee about sexual harassment comprising two deans, two women teachers and a legal expert was already in place in the university. The matter has been referred to the committee for inquiry and I am unable to comment on it before submission of the inquiry report, the official said.

A member of the inquiry committee approached by this reporter also stated that the matter was highly confidential and he could not comment on it.

However, he informed this scribe that the committee had started its proceedings and the allegations would be counter-checked from the accuser before finalizing its report. He said the committee had held a few meetings.

However, Governor Shah Farman, who is also chancellor of the public sector universities, was not satisfied with the university’s own committee, which according to him might be influenced. Therefore, he ordered a high-powered committee to look into the matter impartially and fix the responsibility.

Another committee has already been formed to look into the sexual harassment charges against a number of employees in Gomal University where a senior professor and dean Prof Dr Hafiz Salahuddin was forced to resign and four more employees including two teachers were sacked.

As far as the matter of the Chinese student is concerned, she had applied as foreign student for a two-year course in English in the University of Malakand a year ago through the Higher Education Commission. But since the university had no clear policy for foreign students, the department concerned declined the admission and rather asked for formation of a proper policy for the foreign students.

It was also not known as what kind of course of study she wanted to take admission in, sources told The News. However, later she was given admission in 2019, the sources said. The university administration, according to the sources, accorded the warmest welcome to the student on her arrival and an official dinner was arranged in her honour, which was attended by all the senior officials of the institution including the vice-chancellor. It was after her arrival in the university that it was known that she wanted to pursue MPhil, a course which the university was not offering at all, the sources said. “Thus she could not be enrolled at all in the university,” the source said.

The university has very recently launched MPhil in English for which applications have been sought, the sources said. “But even now she doesn’t qualify for the MPhil and can’t be enrolled,” the source said. Unable to enroll her in the course, she wanted to study, the university administration offered her temporary job on a daily wage basis.

The office order to this effect says: “On recommendation of Principal University Public School and Girls’ college the vice-chancellor is pleased to hire the services of Ms Zhou Min as lab attendant on daily wage basis at the rate of Rs 900 for a period of six months.” During her stay in the university, she got special attention from her teacher(s).

She got the opportunity to visit all the scenic places like Kalam, Laram and others in Swat and Dir districts along with her teacher(s), the sources said. After staying in the university for a few months, she returned home. There are meagre chances that she would return to the university as she won’t be able to pursue the courses of her choice, the sources said.",['Yousaf Ali'],"PESHAWAR: The alleged sexual harassment of a Chinese student at the University of Malakand by no one else but her own teacher has taken a serious turn as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Shah Farman Khan took notice and ordered an inquiry into the matter.

A five-member Shariat Appellate Bench of the apex court headed by Justice Mushir Alam and comprising Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, Dr Muhammad Al-Ghazali ad hoc member-I and Dr Muhammad Khalid Masood ad-hoc member-II heard the case and acquitted Muhammad Hanif after 14 years.

During the course of proceedings, the public prosecutor said the accused killed Ziarat Bibi after raping her and two relatives of the victim saw the accused fleeing. He said the victim was a mother of five children. Justice Qazi Amin remarked that apparently the incident did not look like as it was being reported and according to the police investigation, the accused was a frequent visitor to the house of the woman. He said no one should be ridiculed so it could not be discussed.

He said there were no reasons for the accused to kill the woman and according to the FIR; the woman was killed by trapping.

2016,1029,1546,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/657429-call-to-combat-domestic-violence-during-covid-19-pandemic,,Call to combat domestic violence during Covid-19 pandemic,"PESHAWAR: The civil society organizations here on Monday called upon the national disaster management agencies to take measures to combat domestic violence at a time when the country is facing the coronavirus pandemic.

The civil society organizations (CSOs) expressed appreciation for the actions that the provincial government had taken to protect citizens from the COVID-19 pandemic. The CSOs appreciated the swift actions of frontline medical staff and security agencies to fight the coronavirus pandemic.

Data released by UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, said that 31 million additional cases of gender-based violence (GBV) were expected if the lockdown continued for six months.

It said that if the lockdown continued for every three months, an additional 15 million extra cases of gender-based violence were expected. The data said that Covid-19 would disrupt efforts to end child marriages, potentially resulting in an additional 13 million child marriages taking place between 2020 and 2030 that could have been averted otherwise.

According to the CSOs, while the root cause of GBV was unequal power relations, the Covid-19 pandemic was likely to increase the known triggers of GBV.

Indications from women’s rights organizations and GBV service providers in Pakistan and elsewhere around the world during Covid-19 showed increased risks of gender-based violence. Qamar Naseem Programme Coordinator Blue Veins and co-chair EVAW/G Alliance KP said, “Women and girls are more affected by pandemics generally because of the gender inequality evident in society at large.

“Women and girls trapped in abusive domestic situations are in jeopardy because of the lockdowns and restrictions on their movements imposed by governments to contain the spread of the pandemic. We call on all the provincial and national disaster management authorities to give attention to this urgent issue so that support to victims of domestic abuse are included in their Covid-19 response plans,” he said.

Sana Ahmad, a women rights activist from “Girls Got Voice, said, “It is clear from pandemic that during health crises, women typically take on

additional physical, psychological and time burdens as caregivers.

As such, it is critical that all actors involved in efforts to respond to Covid-19 - across all sectors - consider GBV within their programs planning and implementation.

Taimur Kamal, Coordinator of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Civil Society Network, said, “The government needs to allocate adequate funding and have careful planning of shelters for women and girls escaping domestic abuse.

It means increasing the level of online support services including help-lines to police and social services.

It is clear that health workers and police services are working at full stretch dealing with the consequences of this pandemic, but it is crucially important that they liaise with civil society organizations so that necessary support is provided to the increasing number of victims of domestic violence as a result of Covid-19.”",['Bureau Report'],"PESHAWAR: The civil society organizations here on Monday called upon the national disaster management agencies to take measures to combat domestic violence at a time when the country is facing the coronavirus pandemic.

""Six years ago, Selma coincided with Eric Garner being murdered. That was the last time we were in a place of ‘I Can’t Breathe.’ I remember at the premiere of Selma us wearing ‘I Can’t Breathe’ T-shirts in protest,"" Oyelowo told Screen Daily.

He continued, ""Members of the Academy called into the studio and our producers saying, ‘How dare they do that? Why are they stirring shit?’ and ‘We are not going to vote for that film, because we do not think it is their place to be doing that.'""

The critically acclaimed movie had been nominated in the Best Picture category at the 2015 Oscars and won Best Original Song for Common and John Legend's Glory.



However, DuVernay was not awarded Best Director award and Oyelowo was also shut out of the Best Actor category.

""It’s part of why that film didn’t get everything that people think it should’ve got and it birthed #OscarsSoWhite,"" Oyelowo explained. ""They used their privilege to deny a film on the basis of what they valued in the world.”

On Twitter, Oyelowo's claims were seconded by DuVernay, who wrote, ""True story.""

The Academy, in response, said, ""Ava & David, we hear you. Unacceptable. We’re committed to progress.""

Photo: File

KARACHI: The Aurat Foundation on Tuesday ""strongly condemned"" the motorway gang rape case and criticised the law enforcement agencies for their “total failure” in protecting the citizens, said a statement issued by women's rights group.

""It is the duty of the state to protect its citizens, women, men and children, irrespective of the time, whether it is day or night, whether they are travelling alone or are in the company of others"", said the statement.

The statement came after Lahore police chief Umar Sheikh blamed the rape victim for travelling late at night and selecting the route that she took. The officer has apologised over his insensitive remarks which drew ire from the public.

The foundation said that rape has been declared a ""crime against humanity"" by the international community through a resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations in 2008.

It added that it was ""unfortunate"" that a senior police official blamed the rape survivor for travelling alone and being influenced by the security situation in France.

""There cannot be any excuse or justification for any crime, in particular for a heinous crime like rape. Is this admission of the inability of the law-enforcers that they cannot guarantee safety and security to its citizens?"" asked the women's rights organisation.

The foundation called upon the prime minister, chief minister Punjab and provincial police chief to ""prosecute and punish"" the suspects in the case. The group said that justice should be provided to the rape survivor to dispel the impression that ""law of the jungle"" reigns supreme in the country.

The incident

The two robbers had allegedly gang-raped a woman in front of her children when her car broke down on the Lahore-Sialkot motorway last week in an area falling within Gujjarpura police station's jurisdiction.

The woman, along with her two children, was driving to Gujranwala when she was forced to stop at around 1:30am at the Gujjarpura section of the motorway after reportedly running out of fuel.

She immediately called a relative and sent him her location. He asked her to also dial the Motorway Police helpline 130 from which she reportedly received no response.

In the meantime, two robbers reportedly approached the car, broke the window, and took the woman and her children to nearby bushes where they allegedly raped her in front of the children.

They also allegedly snatched her purse carrying Rs100,000 in cash, one bracelet, car registration papers, and three ATM cards.",[],"Group says justice should be provided to rape survivor to dispel impression that ""law of the jungle"" reigns supreme in country.

1633,646,973,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/718925-another-gang-rape-in-karachi,,Another gang rape in Karachi,"KARACHI: Karachi has witnessed an increasing number of incidents of rape, attempt to rape, sexual assault, gang rape or murder after rape in the recent days.

In the latest incident of an apparent gang rape, a 22-year-old girl has claimed that she was kidnapped from the upscale Clifton neighbourhood on Monday night in a black Vigo and was repeatedly raped by two men. The victim is a resident of District South of Karachi and worked for a private organisation.

Initially, it was reported in the media that the young woman was found unconscious in the Clifton locality on Tuesday morning after she was repeatedly raped throughout the night after her abduction on Monday night; however, police said that the young woman was picked up at around 9:30pm on Monday night and then dropped at around 11:30pm the same night.

The police were informed through Police Helpline 15 on Tuesday afternoon in which the victim’s sister narrated the ordeal of the victim.

The police then recorded the statement of the woman and initiated further investigations. They took her to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center for medical examination as well as for collection of DNA samples. The police investigators also visited the spots from where the victim was picked up and dropped and collected the evidence as well as recording statements of the people.

“The men on a black Vigo took me to the third floor of a building and raped me after picking me from near the Abdullah Shah Ghazi's shrine,” a senior police officer while quoting the victim’s statement said. “Then they dropped me outside the mall in Clifton.”

The officer, while quoting the victim, further said that while dropping her, one of the two suspects also gave her a cell phone number, offering her to hire her on Rs30,000 if she needed a job. Following the incident, the police investigators have initiated further investigations. “It is too early to conclude anything. We are working on the victim’s version,” said South Zone police chief DIG Javed Akbar Riaz while talking to The News. “We have identified the suspects. We have deployed our resources to arrest the suspects and to pursue the investigation on merit.”

DIG Riaz said that the police were taking such incidents very seriously and also attached women officers to the case due to its sensitivity. ""We have also formed special raiding teams for the arrest of the suspects,” the officer said. “Her medical examination has also been conducted and DNA samples have also been collected and the police investigators are now waiting for the reports.”

The police investigators were also recording the statements of witnesses to get help in probing the incident. “We have met the victim and her medical test has also been conducted,” Clifton ASP Zahida Perveen told The News. “We are also trying to obtain the CCTV footage from both the spots – from where she was picked and dropped,” the officer said. Police said that a case had been registered while further investigation was underway.

This was not the first incident to have occurred in the Karachi city as earlier, the body of five-year-old girl Marwa was found from a trash can in a park on September 6. It had multiple torture marks and was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre. Her autopsy reports revealed that she had been raped. The girl was hit with a heavy object on the head multiple times which resulted in her death.

Also on September 15, in a ghastly incident, two men sexually assaulted a disabled married woman in a slum area of Karachi. According to reports, the disabled woman was alone in her hut in Baldia Town’s Qaimkhani Colony when two men entered her abode and sexually assaulted her. As the victim raised hue and cry, a score of neighbouring people came to her rescue.",['Faraz Khan'],"KARACHI: Karachi has witnessed an increasing number of incidents of rape, attempt to rape, sexual assault, gang rape or murder after rape in the recent days.

JARANWALA: A woman hacked off a man’s genitals a day before his mehndi celebration, accusing him of attempting to rape her, Geo News reported on Tuesday.

According to Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Jaranwala Bilal Sulehri, the initial investigation revealed that the man and the woman knew each other as they were neighbours. The man was about to marry another woman but on the night of January 30, he went to the victim’s house for unexplained reasons.

The police officer said that when the man arrived, the woman allegedly attacked the man 'as an act of revenge' and cut off his genitals.

However, according to an FIR filed by the woman's family, the man had allegedly attempted to rape the woman by threatening her with a knife. The woman resisted his attempts, grabbed the knife from his hands and cut off his genitals.

The wounded man was admitted at Civil Hospital Faisalabad, from where he was discharged today. He has yet to give his statement on the incident.

2028,1041,1566,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/743962-girl-child-needs-focused-parenthood-for-healthy-social-growth,,Girl child needs focused parenthood for healthy social growth,"Islamabad : The experts speaking at a webinar urged the parents to focus more on mental, social and physical healthy growth of their girls. Prioritizing girls in the family-life would make them equally mature, nurtured and responsible citizens.

Physical protection is the major challenge facing the minor and teenage girls to avoid physical and sexual abuse. Talking about the social taboos, they said the early marriages deprive the girls of their education, healthy physical and social growth. The teen mothers are more prone to weaker health, pregnancy complications and maternal deaths.

The webinar on the role of healthy and educated girls for a prosperous society was organized by the Development Communications Network (Devcom-Pakistan) and DTN on Saturday.

The panelist included chairperson National Commission on the Rights of Children (NCRC) Afshan Tehseen Bajwa, Devcom-Pakistan Executive Director Munir Ahmed, former parliamentarian from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Miraj Humayun, consultant with an Asian Development Bank (ADB) project Muniza Tarar, and educationist and social activist Meeran Malik.

The NCRC chairperson Afshan Tehseen Bajwa said girls are the children of a lesser god in our society despite our religion has given much more rights to them. We need to change our social behaviours towards our daughters. They need to have equal opportunities of education, health, food and nutrition and social protection. Once it would be fully functional, she said the NCRC would play a pivotal role to ensure their physical protection of their rights according to the religion, national and international commitments. Despite no funds and facilities, we are still putting our efforts to highlight the crimes against children especially girls and consistently follow-up the cases of rape, physical abuse and other sort of victimization.

Devcom-Pakistan Executive Director Munir Ahmed said the parents in our society have proved to be very rigid towards their daughters. All the teachings of our religion and the awareness campaigns could not bring the change we required to prioritize the social, mental and physical growth of our daughters. Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (2017-18) has revealed that 37 per cent of the girls were married by the age of 18 while 8 per cent got married when they were 15 years old. Around 70 percent of the girls lacked adequate nutrition. The pregnancy complications and maternal deaths were far less in the girls married at the age of 25-29.

Munir Ahmed said more girl-child focused parenthood and public funding would help improve the health and wellbeing indicators of the SDG-3, and quality education (SDG-4) and gender equality (SDG-5) and decent work and economic growth (SDG-8). Girls’ education is crosscutting to all the SDGs. Educating the girl child helps in the improvement of a good life, improved health as they bring an awareness of the importance of hygiene and health. Through education, they can lead a healthy lifestyle. The women that are educated can care for their children better. Former parliamentarian from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Miraj Humayun said the situation in KP was much embarrassing as the girls’ education, health and social growths deteriorated over the years. Population and poverty index both are rising in the province unchecked. Parents do not have sufficient resources to feed and educate their children despite knowing the benefits.

Consultant with an Asian Development Bank (ADB) project Muniza Tarar said all the researches show that Pakistan is a patriarchal society where men are the primary authority figures and women are subordinate. Gender is one of the organizing principles of Pakistani society where women lack social value and status because of negation of their roles as producers and providers in all social roles. The educationist and social activist Meeran Malik said girls are more prone to health and social challenges in the rural areas where most of the population lives. The families have less resources and even meagre resources for their children. Girls come after the boys when it is to educate them and provide health and social protection.

Our correspondent adds: Kohsar police on Saturday arrested an accused supplying drugs at educational institutions and various areas of the city and recovered heroin, hashish and Ice, a police spokesman said.

Following orders of IGP Islamabad Muhammad Aamir Zulfiqar Khan, he said DIG (Operations) Waqar Uddin Syed had categorically directed all police officers to accelerate their efforts against drug dealers/smugglers to purge this menace from the city.

Following these directions, SP (City-Circle) Muhammad Omer Khan constituted special anti-drug police team under supervision of ASP Ayesha Gul including SHO Kohsar Police Sub-Inspector Shabbir Ahmed Tanoli, Sub-Inspectors Nawazish Khan along with others officials.

This team nabbed drug pusher from Saidpur and recovered 4 kilogram hashish, 2 kilogram heroin and 500 garm Ice from him.",['Afshan S. Khan'],"Islamabad : The experts speaking at a webinar urged the parents to focus more on mental, social and physical healthy growth of their girls.

The moves comes after thousands of Liberians protested rising incidents of rape in the capital Monrovia last month, in a bid to draw attention to the country´s alarming rate of sexual assault.

Late on Friday, Weah said he would install a special prosecutor for rape in Liberia, as well as set up a national sex offender registry, a statement from his office said.

The government will also establish a so-called ""national security task force"" on sexual- and gender-based violence.

The high rates of rape in impoverished Liberia, forced to contend both with war and the Ebola virus in recent years, has been a longstanding concern. A UN report in 2016 recorded 803 rape cases the previous year in the country of 4.5 million, and found that only two percent of sexual violence cases led to a conviction, for example.

It was the resulting sense of impunity and the legacy of the 14-year civil war between 1989 and 2003, when rape was commonplace, that had created the current problem, it said.

1139,152,256,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/719319-son-of-late-parliamentarian-among-clifton-gang-rape-suspects,,Son of late parliamentarian among Clifton gang rape suspects,"KARACHI: Mystery has deepened over the kidnapping and subsequent gang rape incident in the upscale Clifton neighbourhood as the police are now ruling out the abduction and group action in the light of some new evidence that “refutes force and coercion factor and appear to be something else.” On the contrary, the law enforcement officers claim that they have established the identities of the alleged rapists and raided to arrest them from a Defence Housing Authority apartment, but found none of them.

After the identification of the suspects and recording of the statement of the young working woman, the police raided an apartment on the third floor of the residential apartment in Khayaban-e-Nishat in DHA, but returned emptyhanded. The police also raided the houses of the suspects’ relatives but could not get hold of the suspects.

The police investigators have obtained multiple CCTV footages, which establish facts contrary to the young woman’s statement. In one of the CCTV footages shown to The News, the woman is not seen to be thrown out of the SUV and was seen coming out of the vehicle along with a shopping bag. The video also showed her to be calm and she quickly walked away from the area.

DIG South Zone police Javed Akbar Riaz told The News, “It does not look like rape and kidnapping but it appears to be some other issue but nothing concrete could be established until and unless the investigation completes. The investigators did not find any evidence or witness to suggest that the woman offered resistance during the entire episode.” The police also questioned the watchman of the apartment where she was taken on Monday night and he also did not recall witnessing the young woman resisting at any point of time.

The police also claim to have identified the suspects and one of whom belongs to Jacobabad and happens to be the son of a late parliamentarian. The investigators have also obtained the cell phone call record of the woman and the suspects, which suggested that they were briefly in contact with each other. “The CDR shows their brief call history,” DIG Riaz explained, but said in the same vein that the “suspects will be arrested soon.” The police investigators also cite the “initial medical examination” which suggests no sign of torture or injury on the woman’s body. Despite the preliminary investigations, medical reports and the phone data, none of which is conclusive or fully established at this point of time, there are too many ifs and buts that need to be answered, a senior police source said while warning against rushing to a hasty conclusion.

Earlier, it was reported that the 22-year-old young working woman and her family had claimed that she was kidnapped and later gang-raped at Karachi’s Clifton neighbourhood on Monday night. It was claimed that she had gone out for snacks to a mall with a friend. Afterwards, two men in a double cabin vehicle kidnapped her from outside the mall. They took her to an apartment where along with their third accomplice they raped her. Initially, it was reported in the media that the young woman was found unconscious on Tuesday morning after being subjected to repeated rape following abduction on Monday night.

The police, however, said that she was picked up at around 9:30pm on Monday night and then dropped at around 11:30pm the same night. An FIR was registered at the Boat Basin police station.",['Faraz Khan'],"After the identification of the suspects and recording of the statement of the young working woman, the police raided an apartment on the third floor of the residential apartment in Khayaban-e-Nishat in DHA, but returned emptyhanded.

2066,1079,1610,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/643234-boy-from-isolated-amazon-tribe-dies-after-being-infected-with-coronavirus,,Boy from isolated Amazon tribe dies after being infected with coronavirus,"BRASÃ­LIA: A Yanomami indigenous boy has died after contracting the coronavirus, authorities in Brazil said Friday, raising fears for the Amazon tribe, which is known for its vulnerability to disease.

The 15-year-old boy, the first Yanomami to be diagnosed with the virus, was hospitalized a week ago at an intensive care unit in Boa Vista, the capital of the northern state of Roraima, officials said.

He died of severe respiratory complications on Thursday night, the Brazilian health ministry said in a statement.

Isolated indigenous peoples in the Amazon rainforest are particularly vulnerable to diseases brought in from the outside world, and a Yanomami rights group said the boy had come in to contact with “many” other indigenous people after he began showing symptoms.

The Hutukara Association blamed “inadequate medical care” for the boy´s death, saying he went more than two weeks without a proper diagnosis from the time he first went to the hospital with respiratory symptoms.

It called on the authorities to track them down and help them undergo testing and self-isolation. It also urged the government to crack down on illegal gold miners on indigenous lands, believed to be the source of the contagion.

A major outbreak among indigenous communities would amount to a “genocide,” said Katia Brasil, editor at Amazonia Real news agency, which specializes in issues facing Amazonian peoples.

“This disease is very dangerous for us,” said Dario Yawarioma, a Yanomami leader. “It´s a very sad day for the Yanomami.”

Brazil is home to an estimated 800,000 indigenous people from more than 300 ethnic groups.

The Yanomami, who are known for their face paint and intricate piercings, number around 27,000.

Largely isolated from the outside world until the mid-20th century, they were devastated by diseases such as measles and malaria in the 1970s.

The boy was studying to become a teacher in the indigenous reserve of Boqueirao, said the Hutukara Association. He was the third indigenous person in Brazil to die after contracting the novel coronavirus, according to newspaper Globo. The others were from the Borari and Muru ethnic groups.",[],"BRASÃ­LIA: A Yanomami indigenous boy has died after contracting the coronavirus, authorities in Brazil said Friday, raising fears for the Amazon tribe, which is known for its vulnerability to disease.

2005,1018,1527,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/714655-motorway-rape-suspect-surrenders-to-lahore-police,,Motorway rape suspect surrenders to Lahore Police,"LAHORE: A man allegedly involved in the Motorway gang-rape incident surrendered himself before the CIA Model Town on Sunday.

The accused, Waqarul Hassan, was accompanied by his father and a friend. In his preliminary statement, he denied that he was involved in the gang-rape incident. The accused hails from Ali Town, district Sheikhupura, and he had left his residence to avoid his arrest. The CIA officials said that the culprit claimed that he had nothing to do with the incident. He told the police that he had a spare-parts workshop and he was in Lahore on the day of the incident to purchase spare-parts. Police claimed Waqar was released in one of two robbery cases 14 days ago.

The suspect has been shifted to the Lahore Investigation Wing Headquarters for questioning. Sources familiar with the investigation said that DNA profile of the suspect Waqar has been sent to the forensic laboratory for matching.

The key suspect, Abid Ali, is still at large and police teams are conducting raids at different locations to apprehend him. Abid Ali, along with his four accomplices,had allegedly raped a woman and her 15-year-old daughter on June 15, 2013. Abid, now 28, previously used four mobile numbers that he abandoned from time to time, and now he was using a fifth number that gave police a lead about the co-suspect Waqar. He had fled along with his wife, as police found a girl and some other documents from his house. Abid was said to be a serial rapist and was booked in seven criminal cases between 2013 and 2017, including two related to gang-rape incidents.

A day earlier, IGP Inam Ghani claimed that the police had identified two criminals allegedly involved in the heinous crime through DNA profile matching and mobile phone tracking.

The gang-rape in Gujjarpura police limits shook the country, but the IGP Inam Ghani overlooked the gravity of the crime and saved the SP, DSP, SHO concerned from punishment by making a promise that if any such incident takes place in future, the police concerned will be answerable. It’s a coincidence that Inam was serving as Additional IGP Punjab when a young girl was gang-raped in Gujjarpura police area in the month of July 2020, and now when he’s serving as the IGP Punjab, a mother of three children had fallen victim to the rapists in the limits of Gujjarpura police.

Special Investigation Team comprising six members had been constituted which could not make any headway in the gang-rape incident that had taken place on Sept 10. The other 20 teams of Lahore Police and the CIA, formed on the direction of the IGP, are also groping in the dark despite having high-tech gadgets, including DNA evidence, geofencing, existing CCTV footage and NADRA records from the spot.

The statement of the CCPO Lahore drew public attention after he raised questions about victim’s carelessness while setting off her journey. Police released the pictures of Abid Ali and Waqar on Saturday. Abid was identified by Forensic Science Laboratory on Sept 11. However, he managed to escape from the scene due to poor strategy of police. He had left his house an hour before the raid of the CTD. Abid’s brother and a relative Abbas were arrested.

Waqar's number was traced through geofencing when it was being used by his brother-in-law. News Desk adds: Shabbir, a brother of Waqarul Hassan, said his brother was not involved in any rape case. He said he had forced his brother to surrender to prove his innocence. Police had illegally detained Waqar’s brother Tanvir and a nephew Ashfaq Ahmad, Shabbir said.

Waqar told police his brother-in-law Abbas “refused to surrender himself along with me but he may do so soon. He was involved in some criminal activities with Abid Ali and is still in contact with him,"" Waqar told police.

Meanwhile, speaking to Geo News, Waqar's mother said her son is ""innocent"" and that he decided to surrender himself after he got to know of the incident. ""If my son had done something wrong, he wouldn't have surrendered himself,"" she said. The suspect's mother appealed to Chief Minister Usman Buzdar to ensure justice is done in Waqar's case. ""My son is a pious and religious person, his life should be spared,"" she said, adding: ""He runs a motorcycle repairing shop in Qilla Sattar Shah. If my son was a culprit, why would he present himself [to the law enforcement agencies],"" she asked. The mother said that she has four daughters and two sons and one of her sons was ill.

Meanwhile, Waqar's father said that his son is not a ""thief"" and ""works at a shop"". He said Waqar is ""innocent"" and appealed to the authorities to release him.",['Salman Aslam'],"LAHORE: A man allegedly involved in the Motorway gang-rape incident surrendered himself before the CIA Model Town on Sunday.

As per the policy, in events such as the Covid-19 pandemic, women face considerable threats to their economic, physical, legal and social security. It mentions four areas where there is a lack of emergency services, especially exacerbates issues of access and relief for women and girls across the following. They are “health, gender-based violence, education and economic resilience”.

The policy document recommends immediate legislative actions that need to be implemented, such as expanding the definition of essential services to include all gender-based violence response services and mechanisms to safeguard against any disruption during any emergency or disaster situations, and strengthening services and ensuring access for GBV survivors during all emergencies, including COVID-19. The policy also calls for expediting the implementation of the Sindh Reproductive Healthcare Rights Act 2019 to ensure the maximum number of attendance in schools, as safe reopening is essential, especially for female students, in Sindh.

The launch was attended by parliamentarians, civil society members, labour unions’ members and other stakeholders. Notable guests included Barrister Murtaza Wahab, advisor to Sindh chief minister on law and environment; Khawar Mumtaz, former National Commission chairperson on the Status of Women; Nuzhat Shirin, Sindh Commission chairperson on the Status of Women, Javed Akhbar; the DIG south in Karachi and others.

Nuzhat Shirin highlighted the policy document, explaining the immediate actions the SCSW actively partook during the Covid-19 pandemic. “The Sindh government has no tolerance towards violence against women. When women institutions were closed during the Covid-19 lockdown, we were online and we made commissions; we addressed complaints that women had related to rations,” she said.

Farida Shaheed, executive director of the Shirkat Gah Women’s Resource Centre, presented key takeaways from the policy document and urged the members of the Sindh government to ensure its timely implementation. Aliya Shahid Secretary of the Women Development Department commended the policy document and stated that under the WDD platform, “Sindh’s legislation is the most pro-women, such as the informal home-based workers act has been passed”.

Dr Talib Lashari said women rights could not be ensured “until human capital is invested in and until poverty and education are not focused on”. Virjee Kholi, Sindh Human Rights Department’s special assistant, said: “We need to implement laws and prevent gender-based violence incidents that affect young girls and women.”

Khawar Mumtaz said the interrelationships of different issues faced by women had been taken into account. She emphasised that the violence against women was the biggest barrier for women being involved in anything.

Dr Yasmin Qazi, B&M Foundation senior advocacy consultant, highlighted the importance of reproductive rights and the need for gender sensitivity among men. Barrister Murtaza Wahab, in his closing remarks, lauded the SCSW and the SG for the launch of the policy document. “We have too many challenges as a country and we need to rise up to the challenges.” Wahab said there was a need for the implementation and deliverance of laws, especially towards the gender-based violence cases.","['Oc', 'Our Correspondent']","In a collaborative effort, the Sindh Commission on the Status of Women (SCSW) and the Shirkat Gah Women’s Resource Centre on Thursday held a launch where a policy document was presented to the Sindh government.

1495,508,777,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/671959-four-killed-in-kabul-mosque-blast-govt,,Four killed in Kabul mosque blast: govt,"KABUL: At least four people were killed after a blast ripped through a crowd during Friday prayers at a mosque in Kabul, Afghan officials said, in the latest attack on the city ahead of potential talks with insurgents.

“Based on our initial information, at around noon explosives placed inside the mosque detonated during Friday prayers,” interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said in a message to journalists. A health ministry spokesman also confirmed the toll, saying the prayer leader and three worshippers were killed at the Sher Shah Suri mosque, while several others were wounded. The attack comes a week after an Islamic State-claimed attack killed two people, including a popular prayer leader, at a mosque on the edge of Kabul’s heavily fortified green zone. Afghanistan is juggling multiple crises, with the coronavirus rapidly spreading across the country and continuing violence even as the government and Taliban signal they are getting closer to sitting down for talks.

President Ashraf Ghani vowed Thursday to complete a Taliban prisoner release that is a key condition to the launch of peace talks with the insurgents. “Once the swap is done, the two sides have pledged to begin negotiations that could end nearly 19 years of war.”

Ghani said he would elaborate next steps in the peace process next week and called for a “humanitarian ceasefire” to provide food and medical assistance during the coronavirus crisis. “In terms of reduction of violence, there has been (one) but the casualty figures still average around 60-70 a day. The number of fatalities unfortunately are averaging 30,” he said. Ghani did not say if the casualties were civilians, fighters or a combination. Ghani said women would form an important part of eventual peace talk negotiating teams. Under the US-Taliban deal, American and foreign forces are slated to leave Afghanistan over the coming months.

The Taliban have largely refrained from launching major attacks on Afghan cities since February, when they signed a deal with the US meant to pave the way for peace talks with the Kabul government. A ceasefire during last month’s Eid al Fitr holidays also sparked hopes that the two sides may be getting closer to holding negotiations even as a recent uptick in fighting has tempered expectations.

The ceasefire was just the second observed in the country since the Taliban were toppled by a US invasion in 2001 following the September 11 attacks by Al-Qaeda, whose leader Osama bin Laden was sheltered by the regime.",[],"KABUL: At least four people were killed after a blast ripped through a crowd during Friday prayers at a mosque in Kabul, Afghan officials said, in the latest attack on the city ahead of potential talks with insurgents.

1630,643,968,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/647336-shc-upholds-death-sentence-of-former-sessions-judge-another-man-in-honour-killing-case,,"SHC upholds death sentence of former sessions judge, another man in honour killing case","The Sindh High Court on Monday dismissed the appeals of a former district and sessions judge and a co-accused who were sentenced to death by the trial court in a case pertaining to honour killing.

Sikandar Ali Lashari, a former district and sessions judge, and co-accused Mohammad Irfan Khan were sentenced to death by an anti-terrorism court that had found them guilty of murdering the young son of another district and sessions judge in Hyderabad.

According to the prosecution, the former judge instructed the co-appellant and three absconding co-accused Ghulam Abbas Siyal, Barkat Lashari and Morchand, to murder Aaqib Hussain Shahani, son of another district and sessions judge, as he came to know about the love affair of his daughter Keenjhar with Shahani.

The prosecution alleged that Irfan and the absconding co-accused killed Shahani on February 19, 2014, while he was travelling with his family near the Wapda sports complex in Hyderabad.

The counsel for the appellants, Sardar Latif Khan Khosa, submitted that no accused was nominated in the FIR and the prosecution case against Sikandar admittedly did not allege his physical participation in the crime. He submitted that Sikandar was implicated purely on circumstantial evidence and no such evidence was produced that would incriminate the appellant with the charge of abetting or masterminding the crime.

Peer Asadullah Shah Rashidi, the counsel for the complainant, argued that the objective of killing was to protect the family honour. He submitted that the CDR data of Sikandar showed that he was using the SIM of prosecution witness Abdul Saleem Afridi at his own IMEI number and he remained in regular contact with the absconder Barkat, who in turn was in contact with the actual killers.

The lawyer submitted that weapons used in the crime had been found by the police on the information provided by Sikandar in the presence of two private witnesses. The empties of the seized weapons had also matched with the empties recovered from crime scene and both the forensic science laboratories reports were available on record which made the case of the prosecution strong enough.

Additional Prosecutor General Khadim Hussain argued that the motive of the murder was obvious as Sikandar was annoyed after he came to know that his daughter had been in love with Aqib. Hussain added that Sikandar had admitted in a video that he was responsible for the murder.

A division bench of the SHC headed by Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar, after hearing the arguments and perusal of the evidence, observed that the mastermind of a crime means a person who is responsible for planning and organising it and in this case, it had been unequivocally proved that Sikandar was the mastermind of killing and he was an abettor without any reasonable doubt.

The high court observed that this was not the prosecution’s case that Sikandar had personally committed the murder or that he was present at the scene of offence but he was its mastermind which in fact it had proved satisfactorily. The SHC observed that the entire evidence was heading towards the direction that the murder was committed on scheming and conspiracy of Sikandar who had arranged or hired the killers to accomplish the job with the aim of satisfying his ego and vengeance.

The high court also observed that as the father of a young girl, he might be annoyed or exasperated on knowing the love affair or romantic attachment of his daughter with the deceased but at the same time he was also a district and sessions judge who had served the judiciary for a long time.

According to the bench, the sentiments of a district and sessions judge must not be like those of an uneducated person as a judge is considered to be the custodian of the law as they are to dispense justice and in no way a judge was expected to take the law in their own hands and adopt any evil design rather than the legal recourse.

The high court observed that the appellant was conscientiously acquainted and well-versed to the consequences of contravention of the law with an ultimate outcome of committing the crime but despite knowing the consequences, he became instrumental and mastermind of the murder of a son of his colleague judge with no empathy or compassion.

The bench observed that due to brutal, spiteful and acrimonious homicide, a man had lost his life in a tender age leaving behind forever grief and misery to his parents and other family members.

The SHC observed that the notorious act of honour killing also branded as karo-kari was cancerous to our society and humanity.

The bench remarked that any such crime is an act of murder in which a person is killed for his or her actual or perceived immoral deeds and comportments as such alleged depraved manners and postures may take the form of alleged marital betrayal, denial to acquiesce an arranged marriage, wanting marriage or divorce, seeming flirtatious demeanor or being raped, etc.

The high court observed that the eyewitnesses had deposed that co-appellant Irfan was the same person who had pulled out Aqib from the car and enfolded his hands from the back side and thereafter Siyal shot Aqib and fired more shots on him after he had fallen down.

The SHC observed that Irfan was equally responsible for the murder under the principle of constructive liability as he not only abetted the offence but also enabled the killer with the common intention to murder Aqib.

The bench observed that whys and wherefores led the court to a denouement and finale that the prosecution had proved the guilt of both the appellants beyond a reasonable doubt and each piece of evidence including the ocular testimony against appellant Irfan, clear admission of guilt through video CD statement and revelation of material and uncontroverted facts through the CDR, had proved the communication between Sikandar and the killers within proximity of time before and after murder on the fateful day and other evidence collected and brought on record by the prosecution was providing all links making out one straight chain where one end of its noose fitted in the neck of the accused persons and the other end touched to the dead body of Aqib and no link was missing from the chain which might disconnect and break the whole chain.

The SHC dismissed the appeals of the appellants and upheld the death sentence awarded to them by the trial court.",['Jamal Khurshid'],"The Sindh High Court on Monday dismissed the appeals of a former district and sessions judge and a co-accused who were sentenced to death by the trial court in a case pertaining to honour killing.

1860,873,1296,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/698373-child-abuse-cases-soar-in-n-ireland,,Child abuse cases soar in N Ireland,"BELFAST: An average of six children were sexually abused every day in Northern Ireland last year, new figures reveal.

Figures from the PSNI obtained by NSPCC Northern Ireland reveal that in the last year, there were 2,082 recorded offences against children under 18 years of age – up 37 per cent in the five years since 2014 and 2015.

Across the UK, there were 73,518 recorded offences including rape, online grooming and sexual assault against children in the UK in 2019/20, up 57 per cent in the five years since 2014/15.

The charity said the figures on child sexual abuse show the need for the Government to deal with the “hidden harms” of the pandemic and ensure support for children who have experienced sexual abuse is embedded in recovery planning.

The NSPCC have called for a cross-departmental strategic framework to support a collaborative response to child sexual abuse in Northern Ireland as recommended by the Criminal Justice Inspection (CJI).

The NSPCC said the needs of children and young people should be at the centre of how authorities respond to child sexual abuse.

NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said: “The crisis of child sexual abuse is not going away and behind these figures are thousands of children and young people who have reported crimes that can have a devastating impact on their lives.

“Urgent action is needed to prevent abuse and to ensure children are supported to recover when they bravely speak out.

“We need concerted leadership from governments across the UK to implement strategies on tackling child sexual abuse that put the experiences and needs of children at their heart and are effective in preventing abuse and helping young people recover.”

The call comes as an NSPCC report found contacts from young people to Childline about sexual abuse in the family tripled during lockdown.

The report published on Monday, The Impact Of The Coronavirus Pandemic On Child Welfare:Sexual Abuse, shows there were an average of 23 contacts to Childline per week about child sexual abuse in the home, up threefold since March 23 when lockdown was enforced.

Some children told Childline that sexual abuse had become more frequent during lockdown, as they were spending more time with their abuser.A third of counselling sessions were about abuse in the family that happened over a year ago, with many children talking about it for the first time.

Anyone concerned about a child can contact the NSPCC Helpline for advice on 0808 800 5000. Adult victims of non-recent sexual abuse can also get in touch for support. Childline is available for young people on 0800 1111 or at childline.org.uk.",[],"The charity said the figures on child sexual abuse show the need for the Government to deal with the “hidden harms” of the pandemic and ensure support for children who have experienced sexual abuse is embedded in recovery planning.

1381,394,604,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/661345-four-accused-held-in-waziristan-honour-killing-case,,Four accused held in Waziristan honour killing case,"MIRANSHAH: The police on Tuesday claimed to have arrested four accused in connection with the recent murder of two teenage girls in the name of honour in North Waziristan.

Speaking at a press conference, District Police Officer Shafiullah Khan Gandapur said that raids were being conducted to arrest the main accused identified as Mahmood Aslam who is stated to be paternal cousin of the girls. The two girls aged 16 and 18 were shot dead in Garyum in North Waziristan on May 14.

He said that the family of the slain girls, who were sisters, and the local people did not want the police to investigate the crime. However, he added that the police had registered the case at the Razmak Police Station on behalf of the state and an investigation team had been formed to probe the matter.

It is stated to be the first incident of its kind in North Waziristan, a former tribal agency that became a district when erstwhile Fata was merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

The short, 52-second video was made on mobile phone. The two teenaged girls and the man, who recorded the video outdoors, are seen in the footage along with a third woman, who was stated to be the wife of the killer and had been spared.

The DPO said that the family of the girls originally belonged to South Waziristan and had shifted to North Waziristan when the military operation was carried out in their areas. The bodies of the girls were secretly shifted to their native Shaktoi area in South Waziristan for burial.

He said that the father of the two girls was also among the four arrested persons. He added that one of the accused, Umar Ayaz, who allegedly leaked the video, belonged to Torikhel in North Waziristan. The DPO said that the video showing the two girls had been made a year ago and had been recently leaked to social media.

Shafiullah Khan said that the police had formed an investigation team on the instructions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General of Police Sanaullah Abbasi. He vowed that all the accused would soon be brought to justice.

He urged the local people to seek help from the police without any fear or hesitation and the cops would extend all-out support to them keeping in view the local customs and traditions. He added that it was the upmost responsibility of the police to protect the life and property of the local people.",['Our Correspondent'],"MIRANSHAH: The police on Tuesday claimed to have arrested four accused in connection with the recent murder of two teenage girls in the name of honour in North Waziristan.

The East district’s judicial magistrate ordered the Federal Investigation Agency’s investigation officer to submit a charge sheet against the accused within 14 days.

The complainant, Tahir Rasheed, had lodged a complaint with the FIA’s Cyber Crime Reporting Centre, saying that his former girlfriend, Sumera Ishaq, was circulating his obscene videos on Facebook through a fake account.

He said he had befriended Ishaq in 2013 and later in 2019 they had fallen in love and started seeing each other at their places. He said he had given her several gifts, including jewellery and clothes, during the relationship.

“We had developed intimacy and we would often do video calls on WhatsApp,” he told the FIA investigators. “She asked me to show myself [naked] on the chat and as I did she recorded me without me knowing.”

He added that after a few days she started demanding money and as he refused, she started blackmailing him with his nude videos and put them on Facebook through a fake account. “The woman blackmailed me after I refused her marriage proposal,” the complainant recorded his statement in the FIR

The IO, sub-inspector Komal Anwer, told the court that following the complaint a raid was conducted at the house of the accused and three phones were seized from her possession. The technical analysis of her mobile phones confirmed that these devices carried Rasheed’s obscene videos and the fake account that circulated them was also active in them.

The FIR is registered under Sections 16, 17, 20, 21, 24 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act read with Section 109 of the Pakistan Penal Code.

The FIA spokesperson said the evidence recovered from the woman’s cell phone and other material suggested that she was involved in similar acts of harassment and blackmailing in the past too. During a preliminary investigation, the spokesperson said they learnt that the arrested woman, a school teacher, was also involved in blackmailing a relative of the victim by capturing his obscene videos.","['Oc', 'Our Correspondent']","A court on Thursday sent a woman to jail in judicial custody on the charges of blackmailing her ex-boyfriend with his nude pictures and videos.

1999,1012,1518,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/750241-rape-laws,,Rape laws,"According to reports that have been reaching the press and the public, the federal cabinet has decided to introduce new laws on rape, gang-rape, and sodomy, which will now also be counted as an offence equivalent to rape through an ordinance. In the first place, it is unclear why laws as sensitive as these with some provisions that are debatable, should be dealt with through an ordinance, which under the law stays in place only 120 days and is not debated by members of parliament. The role of parliament is after all to debate measures proposed to discuss the pros and cons and therefore make it easier to decide what would be most beneficial for the country and its people.

Pakistan already has a series of laws which deal with rape, gang-rape, and also child marriage or forcible remarriage. There are also issues such as the age of consent, with religious scholars also contesting what the age of marriage should be in terms of Islamic provisions and the law of Pakistan. While there is no doubt that some of the provisions introduced are well-thought-out, we also need to consider why new laws are needed in the first place. Surely the most important thing would be to introduce measures to ensure we have a higher rate of conviction for rape offenders. Currently, only four percent of those accused of rape are convicted and of these 97 percent later have their sentences reduced or acquitted. This figure means that the current laws do not act as they should. In this situation, it is doubtful whether new measures such as chemical castration, or any such harsher penalties, will in any way be beneficial.

We need to also consider the dichotomy between the laws which exist and the differences between them, with one contradicting the other. These need to be sorted out. And only parliament can achieve this, so that there is a standard acceptable law that reaches across Pakistan and also deals with issues such as child pornography and related matters. The issue of special courts or special investigators is also something that needs to be discussed. In the past, special courts or tribunals have not proved to be very successful. What we need is special police officials who are trained to investigate rape cases using DNA evidence, which is now the standard across the world.

Fortunately, the cabinet has suggested and put in writing an end to the two-finger examination for determining rape, which is humiliating and traumatic for the rape survivor/victim. It is also vital that the new law protect the victim and not hurt her or him further through the processes that are used. Many survivors/victims back away from cases after facing the kind of crude onslaught they come under, and in some cases because of threats made by culprits who may be influential. We also need to think about reform, or restorative justice. And all this must be done keeping in mind that this is a crime of power rather than one of lust.",[],"According to reports that have been reaching the press and the public, the federal cabinet has decided to introduce new laws on rape, gang-rape, and sodomy, which will now also be counted as an offence equivalent to rape through an ordinance.

1128,141,235,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/655167-after-killing-hasnain-stray-dogs-claim-life-of-another-boy-from-larkana,,"After killing Hasnain, stray dogs claim life of another boy from Larkana","A few months after the death of Hasnain, a six-year-old boy who was mauled by a pack of dogs in Larkana and later died of the resulting complications at a hospital in Karachi in December last year, another boy from Larkana died at a hospital in Karachi on Wednesday due to full-blown rabies.

According to the Indus Hospital where nine-year-old Zeeshan breathed his last, the boy was bitten by a rabid dog in his hometown and was not properly vaccinated despite approaching the public health facility in his area.

“Today, the nine-year old boy from Larkana died at the Indus Hospital Karachi due to full-blown rabies. He was probably mauled on face by a rabid dog in his hometown. His parents took him to a public health facility where they gave him some injections but apparently the anti-rabies vaccine (ARV) was not administered properly and immunoglobulin was not given to the ill-fated boy,” said Aftab Gohar, the incharge of the dog-bite centre at the Indus Hospital Karachi.

Zeeshan is the second unfortunate boy from Larkana who died in recent months due to dog bite. Earlier, six-year-old Hasnain, who had been mauled by stray dogs when he was playing outside his residence, passed away despite his treatment at the National Institute of Child Health (NICH) Karachi for over a month. Hasnain, however, did not die of rabies.

With the death of Zeeshan, the number of rabies encephalistis deaths in Sindh in 2020 has reached six. Officials said that of the six victims, three died at the Indus Hospital Karachi while the other three passed away at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre. The victims also include two children.

The Indus Hospital’s dog-bite centre claims that they have so far received 3,000 victims of dog bite from the entire Sindh, of whom a majority were children. It also highlights the fact that the government has yet to take an effective action against the rising number of stray dogs in the city and other parts of the province.

Gohar said Zeeshan was taken to the Civil Hospital Larkana after his condition deteriorated despite receiving several ‘so-called ARV injections’. The Civil Hospital Larkana referred him to the National Institute of Child Health (NICH) Karachi. “The NICH referred him to the Indus Hospital as the boy had already developed full-blown rabies and nothing could have been done to save his life.”

He stated that a few weeks back, a seven-year old boy from the New Karachi area was brought to the Indus Hospital with full blown rabies. The boy had not received any anti-rabies vaccine, he said and added that an adult from a small town of Sindh also passed away at the Indus Hospital a few months back after he had developed rabies encephalitis.

“When a rabid dog bites a person and the wound is very deep, the patient must be given immunoglobulin immediately, which contains antibodies that fight the rabies virus transmitted to the body of the person through the saliva of the rabid dog. In addition to immunoglobulin, the patient should be given four to five doses of an international quality anti-rabies vaccine,” Gohar said.

Experts say any person who is bitten by dogs should wash their wounds with soap and water thoroughly and then rush to some tertiary-care hospital for vaccination.",['M. Waqar Bhatti'],"“Today, the nine-year old boy from Larkana died at the Indus Hospital Karachi due to full-blown rabies.

1960,973,1451,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/716031-all-that-glitters-is-not-gold-amnesty-international-s-alarming-report-about-rape-cases-in-ideal-nordic-countries,,All that glitters is not gold: Amnesty International’s alarming report about rape cases in ‘ideal’ Nordic countries,"ISLAMABAD: The four Nordic countries, which are referred to by many as role models in terms of women’s right and a low crime rate, have been found by Amnesty International to have a disturbingly high level of rape cases because of their failed justice systems.

Amnesty International in its 2019 report states: “Despite being among the top-ranking countries in the world in terms of gender equality, the four Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) have disturbingly high levels of rape, and survivors of sexual violence are being failed by their justice systems.”

The report states that flawed legislation and widespread harmful myths and gender stereotypes have resulted in endemic impunity for rapists across the region. “It is a paradox that the Nordic countries, which have strong records of upholding gender equality, suffer shockingly high levels of rape,” Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International’s Secretary General was reported as saying.

The report also spoke about unreported cases and said: “Social stigma and a lack of trust in the justice system often mean that women and girls fail to report attacks, and those that do, are frequently failed by callous and prejudiced justice systems or outdated laws. One survivor told us she would never have reported her rape if she had known how she would have been be treated, and her story is typical in justice systems which are stacked against rape survivors.”

Whilst the situation facing survivors of rape is not uniform across the four Nordic countries, there are disturbing parallels among their criminal justice systems that ignore, deny and tacitly condone sexual violence against women, the report adds.

Finland: According to the report, every year around 50,000 women in Finland experience sexual violence, including rape. Most of those responsible for these crimes are never brought to justice. In 2017, only 209 convictions were secured for rape.

Some survivors told Amnesty International that they had had positive and supportive experiences with the police and justice system. Others have described how the lack of understanding reflected deeply entrenched myths about rape and female sexuality that impact directly on access to justice.

Interviewed survivors described the process as stressful, scary and stigmatizing, regardless of the outcome of the case. One survivor told Amnesty International: “At the trial I thought, and said to my counsel, that if I had known what this would be like, I would never have reported the rape.”

Norway: Norwegian authorities have not taken the necessary measures to prevent rape and other forms of sexual violence or to address the consequences when such crimes occur. Prevailing and erroneous myths about rape make it hard for rape victims to report the crime to the police or to seek medical help. They also influence the way rape cases are handled by the criminal justice system.

Many rapes are not reported to the police, but even those survivors who do turn to the police face a lengthy and often flawed process. One survivor told Amnesty International: ""It took almost two years from the time I reported in the autumn of 2016, until the case was closed in the spring of 2018. It is a long time to wait.”

Sweden: Despite the large number of rapes, there are very low prosecution rates in Sweden with only 6 percent of cases involving adults resulting in prosecution in 2017. Low prosecution and conviction rates affect confidence in the justice system.

Nevertheless, in many instances, treatment of rape victims by the police has generally improved in recent years and the 2018 legal reforms require investigating police officers to immediately inform the victim about their right to counsel of their choice, free of charge.

In Sweden, flaws in the judicial processes need to be addressed, particularly in the police's handling of rape cases. The inconsistent application of best practice working methods for investigations of sexual offences against adults and delays in results of forensic analysis were highlighted by representatives of different authorities, while some survivors described unacceptable delays in interviewing identified suspects.

Denmark: Rape in Denmark is hugely under-reported and even when women do go to the police, the chances of prosecution or conviction are very slim. Of the 24,000 women found by a recent study to have experienced rape or attempted rape in 2017 alone, just 890 rapes were reported to the police. Of these, 535 resulted in prosecutions and only 94 in convictions.",['Ansar Abbasi'],"“It is a paradox that the Nordic countries, which have strong records of upholding gender equality, suffer shockingly high levels of rape,” Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International’s Secretary General was reported as saying.

1757,770,1153,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/662426-this-is-how-police-solved-boy-s-murder-mystery-in-48-hours,,This is how police solved boy’s murder mystery in 48 hours,"LAHORE:The Lahore Investigation Wing police have really performed a miracle by saving huge expenses on DNA tests, which had cost Rs 80m to the Punjab police in the Zainab murder case, and solved a child abuse and murder case by only one DNA test and above all within 48 hours.

On May 16, 10-year-old boy Ghulam Mustafa was found dead from an under construction plaza in Nawab Town. The condition of the body and circumstantial evidence implied that the boy had been abused and murdered.

The murderer also tried to set the boy ablaze and create an impression that the boy had tried to set himself on fire. The killer failed to burn the body as he heard someone’s loud voice in the plaza that was also used by locals as a shortcut passage to reach their locality. He placed the body in the washroom, locked the room from inside and escaped through a small window over the door.

The matter was brought to the notice of DIG Investigation Lahore Dr Inam Waheed, who reached the crime scene and constituted eight teams to solve the mysterious death. The first team was directed to talk to local children, the second team was asked to identify people who were involved in such crimes, the third team was ordered to interview local labourers, the fourth team was asked to engage local vendors for information, the fifth team was to interview locals, the sixth team was tasked with checking locals as well as CCTV cameras, the seventh team was in contact with family members of the victim and the eighth team was supposed to coordinate with all teams.

The idea to talk to the children in a friendly way worked and one of the children informed the police that a local of the area, Abdul Rehman, was involved in abusing children. Another child told the police that an abused victim and his family had left the locality. The police asked the boy to lead them to the house of the accused. Meanwhile, another team rushed to the houses of other victims, including the family which had migrated from Lahore.

The police team was informed by the family that Abdul Rehman had abused their child and they left the city in shame. As per police, Adbul Rehman had abused three boys after luring them as they played outside their homes.

His offense became more serious as he continued to evade capture, with the intervention of elders of the area, who requested the victims’ families to forgive him. There was a distinct pattern to his offences. In each case he approached his victims near to where he could easily abuse them. The swift investigation led the detectives to present evidence to Abdul Rehman, including a positive DNA match, which left him unable to deny his heinous crimes.

There is no shred of doubt that the Lahore Investigation Wing has saved the city from a new threat. A racket in Kasur in 2015 had caused the removal of then Kasur DPO Rai Babar Saeed, who is presently serving as DIG Operations Lahore.

The then Punjab Chief Minister had made Additional IG Special Branch Arif Mushtaq, DPO Rai Babar Saeed and two DSPs OSDs over their negligence and misreporting of the incident, following recommendations of the then IGP Mushtaq Ahmad Sukehra.",['Salman Aslam'],"The condition of the body and circumstantial evidence implied that the boy had been abused and murdered.

Police collected the remains of the body and shifted them to morgue. The victim has been identified as Bilal, son of Sharif. Police quoted the Safari Park employees as saying that the victim was cutting grass when he went near the cage of lions. The lions attacked him and tore him apart. Police have also started grilling the park employees.

Meanwhile, the family of the victim reached the park and lodged protest. They alleged that the negligence of park administration resulted in the tragic incident. They claimed someone killed Bilal and dumped his body in the cage of lions.

It is also learnt that the CCTV cameras of Safari Park were out of order. The victim’s mother tried to search him the other day. Further investigation is underway.

Safari Park Deputy Director Chaudhry Shafqat Ali said the youth jumped over the fence apparently with a sickle to fetch some grass and was attacked by a lion which got hold of its prey from the neck, giving no time to the victim to act or a chance to even cry.

The fence is inadequate if someone was able to climb and get across to the danger zone. The authorities need to consider fortifying the boundaries for security purposes so that nobody ever dares try such a thing. The victim’s relatives had sought the park officials’ help in tracing

According to investigators, the suspects’ samples had been taken and sent to a laboratory to ascertain whether they were involved in the rape.

Earlier, the police had taken one of the victim’s neighbour, Nawaz, into custody on Sunday and the suspect’s DNA samples were sent to a laboratory in the University of Karachi. Meanwhile, medico-legal officer Dr Zakia has confirmed that the minor girl was subjected to rape before murder. The officer explained that the girl had been hit in her head with a heavy object.

As the news of the heinous crime was spread on Monday, ‘Justice for Marwah’ became one of the top trends on social media. Angered residents of the Essa Nagri area in Gulshan-e-Iqbal had held an hours-long protest on Sunday on the main University Road, following the recovery of her body.

The culprits had even torched her body so that it could not be identified and dumped it into a vacant plot in the area. The family ended the protest after giving a three-day ultimatum to the government and police and warned of holding another major protest if the real culprits were not traced and arrested within three days.

The minor girl was kidnapped a couple of days ago and her body bearing torture marks was found in the early hours of Sunday near her residence in the Essa Nagri area that falls within the jurisdiction of the PIB Colony police station.

The funeral prayers for the victim were also offered during the protest after Zuhr prayers. She was then laid to rest at a graveyard in Baldia Town. The protest, however, continued after the funeral prayers and burial.

The victim’s paternal uncle told the media that the girl’s father was a rickshaw driver. He added that his five-year-old niece was kidnapped near her residence on Friday at around 7am when she had left her home to buy biscuits from a nearby shop and since then her whereabouts had been unknown until her body was found in a garbage dump in a plot.

The uncle explained that unidentified persons had first kidnapped her and then murdered her after subjecting her to rape. Later, they set her body on fire so that she could not be identified.",['Our Correspondent'],"Police officials investigating the rape and murder case of a minor girl in Gulshan-e-Iqbal have rounded up 11 more suspects for their alleged involvement in the crime.

APP/Syed Abbas Mehdi/Files

ISLAMABAD: A draft position paper on police reforms has been prepared by Pakistan's Sustainable Social Development Organization (SSDO), in collaboration with the United States Institute for Peace (USIP), aimed at more effective legislation and capacity building of the law enforcement department.

Prepared in consultation with police officers as the pilot project of ""Police Awam Saath Saath (PASS),"" the draft position paper would be presented to senators and members of the assemblies. A news release issued Sunday said it contained recommendations of parliamentary groups.

Four parliamentary groups, comprising members from National Assembly and Senate, as well as the provincial assemblies of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, and Punjab, were formed to bring reforms in the police department by introducing modern research mechanisms and necessary legislation.

Mobilising lawmakers for the institutional reforms were vital for a more vibrant judicial system, which had a key role in ensuring the rule of law in Pakistan.

The paper suggested urgent ""strategic initiatives"" to further improve law and order besides the prevention of incidents of violence at different levels.

Moreover, it underlined the difference between 'police reforms' and 'policing reforms,' noting that the former were linked to the department's organisational aspects, while the latter related to functions or service delivery aspects, such as case registration, investigation methods, bail and remand laws, trial procedures, and handling of offenders and juveniles.

The service delivery issues discussed in the paper focused on the topics of women in police, investigation, community policing, and information technology in police.

Parliamentarians' recommendations about the 'women in police' section were mostly about categorising women officials in the police department and crimes against women. They asked to ensure that women working at police stations were functional units of law enforcement agencies, with increased induction of staff, as well as retention and training of women officials in the department.

Women parliamentarians strongly recommended that crimes against women should be professionally measured through investigation by women police officers as it would help minimise communication gap and increase empathy.

They also asked for increased coordination for evidence collection to carve out strategies in order to deal with criminals through reliable databases.

The draft paper also stressed on functional specialisation, renewal of investigation resources and methods alongside accountability for defective investigation, standardisation, evidence-based arrests, police prosecution, and forensic cooperation.

The parliamentarians stressed for the recorded, rule-based management of cases, only to be conducted and supervised by investigators rigorously trained in police investigation, forensic, human rights compliance, and legal matters.

They asked to develop a separate and specialised investigation wing of police stations to ensure more focused investigative measures to provide relief to the victims.

The parliamentarians called for increasing the investigation budget, decentralisation, as well as a professional audit to make disbursements easy and transparent.

They said police should be bound only to make evidence-based arrests with few exceptions, which would result in lessening the judiciary’s burden and improve investigation quality with better conviction rate in cases sent for prosecution.

Community policing, the recommendations said, must be institutionalised through a clear and rule-based mandate and a system for selection and removal, tenure to ward off any political, and personal considerations, besides compatibility through integrating initiatives into the larger criminal justice system.

The paper recommended moving from digitisation to digitalisation, declaring the primacy of electronic evidence relevant and admissible under the law of evidence, as well as ensuring cyber security and data privacy for citizens’ dignity and integrity of police organisation.

""The development of this document has been a great learning for us from its conception to completion,” SSDO Executive Director Syed Kausar Abbas said, expressing gratitude to legislators, police officers, and the District Management Group (DMG) personnel for timely and relevant recommendations.

increase empathy.","['position', 'draft', 'pakistans', 'issued', 'peace', 'women', 'investigation', 'evidence', 'institute', 'ssdo', 'policing', 'paper', 'officers', 'parliamentarians', 'reforms',

Taking to Twitter, PM Imran said the ordinance will close all “loopholes”.

The premier said that he spoke to a police hero who played a key role in the recovery of Kashmore rape victim and lauded his bravery.

Kashmore tragedy

The premier lauded Sindh Police ASI Mohammad Bux Buriro and his daughter for their part in rescuing a four-year-old girl from men who tortured and gang-raped her.

""Spoke to ASI Buriro lauding his and his daughter's exemplary initiative and courage in the arrest of Kashmore rapist,"" he wrote in a tweet. ""The nation is proud of them and he has given positive uplift to the image of the police.""

The premier was referring to the sexual assault of a minor and her mother by three men in Kashmore.

A young woman from Karachi was duped by three men who took her to Kashmore with the promise of a job. They gang-raped her before selling her to Khairullah Bugti — a member of the gang — while the child remained with the other two.

Later, she was let go on the condition that she would lure another woman. However, she approached the Kashmore police who helped her recover the daughter.

Speaking to Zara Hut Kay hosts on Dawn TV, SSP Amjad Ahmed Khan said since the police department lacked female officers, ASI Buriro offered to use his daughter to set trap for the suspects..

Rape laws in Pakistan

There has been much debate around rape laws in Pakistan. The incident of Kasur's Zainab and more recently the motorway gang-rape in Lahore sparked a debate on the severity of punishment to prevent sexual assaults.

Speaking at a joint sitting of the Parliament after the passage of bills pertaining to the FATF, PM Imran had said that the government will soon introduce a three-tier legislation including registration of sex offenders, exemplary punishment for rape and child abuse and effective policing.

In an interview, PM Imran had suggested public hanging and chemical castrating the convicts to curb rising sexual violence in the country.",[],"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday announced that the federal government is bringing a ""stringent and holistic anti-rape ordinance"" next week.

1048,61,98,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/678617-house-passes-sweeping-police-overhaul-after-floyd-s-death,,House passes sweeping police overhaul after Floyd’s death,"WASHINGTON: The House approved a far-reaching police overhaul from Democrats on Thursday, a vote heavy with emotion and symbolism as a divided Congress struggles to address the global outcry over the deaths of George Floyd and other Black Americans, foreign media reported.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gathered with members of the Congressional Black Caucus on the Capitol steps, challenging opponents not to allow the deaths to have been in vain or the outpouring of public support for changes to go unmatched. But the collapse of a Senate Republican bill leaves final legislation in doubt.

“Exactly one month ago, George Floyd spoke his final words — ‘I can’t breathe’ — and changed the course of history,” Pelosi said. She said the Senate faces a choice “to honor George Floyd’s life or to do nothing.”

The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is perhaps the most ambitious set of proposed changes to police procedures and accountability in decades. Backed by the nation’s leading civil rights groups, it aims to match the moment of demonstrations that filled streets across the nation. It has almost zero chance of becoming law.

On the eve of the vote, President Donald Trump’s administration said he would veto the bill. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has also said it would not pass the Republican-held chamber.

After the GOP policing bill stalled this week, blocked by Democrats, Trump shrugged. “If nothing happens with it, it’s one of those things,” Trump said. “We have different philosophies.”

Congress is now at a familiar impasse despite protests outside their door and polling that shows Americans overwhelmingly want changes after the deaths of Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others in interactions with law enforcement.

The two parties are instead appealing to voters ahead of the fall election, which will determine control of the House, Senate and White House. “We hear you. We see you. We are you,” said Rep.

Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., during the debate It has been a month since Floyd’s May 25 death sparked a global reckoning over police tactics and racial injustice. Since then, funeral services were held for Rayshard Brooks, a Black man shot and killed by police in Atlanta. Thursday is also what would have been the 18th birthday of Tamir Rice, a Black boy killed in Ohio in 2014.

Lawmakers who have been working from home during the COVID-19 crisis were summoned to the Capitol for an emotional, hourslong debate. Dozens voted by proxy under new pandemic rules.

During the day, several Democratic lawmakers read the names of those killed, shared experiences of racial bias and echoed support of Black Lives Matter activists.

Rep. Karen Bass, DCalif., the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said hundreds of thousands of people “in every state in the union” are marching in the streets to make sure Floyd “will not be just another Black man dead at the hands of the police.”

Republican lawmakers countered the bill goes too far and failed to include GOP input. “All lives matter,” said Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz. New York Rep. Pete King said it’s time to stand with law enforcement, the “men and women in blue.” House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy decried the “mob” of demonstrators.",['News Report'],"But the collapse of a Senate Republican bill leaves final legislation in doubt.

1450,463,715,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/743068-issue-of-sexual-harassment-resurfaces-on-campuses,,Issue of sexual harassment resurfaces on campuses,"PESHAWAR: The issue of sexual harassment has resurfaced in the educational institutions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and triggered concern among parents.

In the historic Islamia College University (ICU), the students staged a protest to urge the university administration as well as the government to provide them protection and implement the Higher Education Commission’s (HEC) policy against sexual harassment. The students’ protest prompted the university administration and the Governor’s Secretariat to issue immediate orders to address the issue. The Governor’s Secretariat through a letter asked the university administration to provide them a report about the issue within two days.

The letter stated that the governor has taken serious notice of the alleged sexual harassment of female students by the teachers and management of the Islamia College University about which a protest had also been staged. Vice-chancellor of the university, Prof Dr Jahan Bakht, who is holding additional charge as he is vice-chancellor of another university, said that he had already referred the case to the sexual harassment committee of the university that would look into as per law. He said being father of four daughters, he himself was seriously concerned about the issue and has a policy of “zero tolerance’ in such matters. The VC maintained that this was the first case reported in the university and he took immediate notice of it. He said that the matter was discussed in the Academic Council meeting on Thursday and the heads of different departments were strictly directed to take every step to ensure protection to the girl students.

He said women constitute 52 percent of the population of the country and such incidents would discourage them from getting education, he added. “The teachers should serve like the father of the students and they should be the one to provide protection to them,” he argued.

He said that no lethargy would be shown in pursuing the case and taking it to its logical conclusion. The HEC policy on sexual harassment had been adopted and action would be taken in light of it, he assured. The students of the university believed that they were feeling insecure in the university. They alleged that their own teachers harass them mainly on the pretext of giving them maximum marks, accepting the research and doing them favour in their studies.

They said that the university administration had badly failed in taking appropriate action against the harassers. The university administration should own and display the HEC policy at every corner of the institution, they added. Sexual harassment of students in educational institutions right from primary schools until universities has become a serious issue in the province. It needs serious consideration and only strict action can help overcome it. The incidents of sexual harassment of girl students have been reported in many universities of the province.

In some cases, even teachers were dismissed from services. Similar cases surfaced in all major institutions including University of Peshawar, Gomal University, Dera Ismail Khan and University of Malakand at Chakdara. This is a serious issue. It is hard for victims to come forward and lodge complaints or go public. But in the Islamia College University, the students were bold enough to go public and stage a peace walk to highlight the issue. Fingers were also pointed at some teachers on the occasion and serious allegations were levelled against them.

Some of the teachers told The News that the motive behind such cases and even the complaints needed to be properly investigated and responsibility fixed.

“The profiles of the accused and the complainants should also be checked in a transparent manner,” one of the teachers said. “It is very easy to level allegation of sexual harassment against anyone and play with his career and chastity,” he said, adding, this should be checked properly.

“If someone is found guilty of harassing students, he should be given exemplary punishment. But if someone has lodged a false and fake complaint against someone, he/she should also be awarded punishment,” the teacher argued.",['Yousaf Ali'],"PESHAWAR: The issue of sexual harassment has resurfaced in the educational institutions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and triggered concern among parents.

Ayesha Omar sent shockwaves down the showbiz with her groundbreaking revelation of being harassed during the early days of her career.



During her Instagram interview with the BBC, Ayesha, along with a number of other prominent figureheads touched upon the rampant issue of rape and harassment within Pakistan and even dived into detail regarding the victim-blaming mentality that is heavily rooted within the crux of the culture.

The short clip began with Ayesha reiterating a number of questions that usually sprout up in people’s minds, some of which include, “What was she doing, what was she wearing, what did she say, how did she act?”

Other stars also popped up for a cameo in the video, adding how people “blame the woman for being irresponsibly leaving her house a later hour” and constantly ask, “Well, why did you go to the market alone, why did you not cover yourself up properly?”

The featured women in the BBC clip all had one thing in common and it was there disdain towards the atrocities being inflicted upon women across the country.

The short clip featuring the actress, is part of an interview she did with director Rose McGowan. In that conversation, Omar claimed that she had finally gathered the strength to speak about what had happened to her all those years ago.

Omar admitted, ""A huge powerful man, twice my age. I had just entered the industry, I was this young 23-year-old, fresh out of college, and bam, this started happening. And it went on for years.""

""It wasn't a one-off incident, and I just didn't want to process it. I put in a box, and I said okay, this is happening in my life, I have to deal with it. I didn't wanna share it with anybody. I let it stay there for 15 years, and I finally spoke about it to someone two years ago.""

""A friend of mine from the industry also came out with her story, and TV channels started calling me up and asking 'Do you think she's telling the truth?'""

1396,409,631,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/713765-rape-cases-on-the-rise,,Rape cases on the rise,"LAHORE: While the Lahore police were literally running from pillar to post till the filing of this report to hunt down the two men who had allegedly raped a woman who was stranded on the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway with her children on Wednesday, the incidence of this heinous crime is surely surging--as is the case anywhere in the world--of course.

Exact figures are hence not available, but a January 12, 2016, statement of the incumbent Punjab Governor Chaudhry Sarwar had shed some light on rape

statistics pertaining to Punjab at least.

Chaudhary Sarwar had revealed: ""Pakistan is among the 10 worst countries when it comes to rape cases. Around 14,850 kidnapping cases involving women, children and girls have been reported in Punjab during the last one year. Around 10,000 rape cases were reported in Punjab during the last three and a half years, from January 2014 to June 2017. Some 2,000 women were kidnapped and 80pc of them were allegedly raped during last year, while 15 per cent of these were killed.

Chaudhary Sarwar was seemingly quite spot on because research conducted by the ‘Jang Group and Geo Television Network' shows 2,669 women in Punjab were raped during 2014, another 2,509 in 2015, some 2,938 in 2016 and 1,365 in 2017.

Research further shows that during 2019, not fewer than 3,881 cases of rape were registered in Punjab, or 581 cases more than what the case was the case in 2018.

The-then Additional Inspector General and the incumbent head of Punjab Police, Inam Ghani, was quoted by media as saying that civil society should play an active role to curb crimes instead of blaming the police.

It is imperative to note that a few years ago, famous international NGO Human Rights Watch had revealed that there while a rape incident occurred once every two hours in Pakistan, and a gang rape was mutilating the honour of a Pakistani woman every single hour.

Rape in Pakistan, which had gained global attention in 2003 after the politically sanctioned gang-rape of a woman Mukhtaran Bibi in the Muzaffargarh District as an ""honour rape"" after allegations that her 12-year-old brother had had sexual relations with a woman from a higher caste, remains a severely under-reported crime till date.

A May 12, 2020 report of the ‘Gulf News’ states: ""An alarming increase has been observed in cases of crime/ violence against women and children in Pakistan during the first quarter of 2020. A periodical report titled ""Tracking crimes against people - A numeric tale of human insecurity,"" which has been released by rights group ""Sustainable Social Development Organisation"" has revealed a 200 per cent increase in cases of violence against women in Pakistan in the past three months. The report, based on print media coverage of such incidents during the above-mentioned period, also shows the crime rate kept fluctuating during the period as 73 per cent drop was witnessed during the month of February but a spike of up to 360 per cent was witnessed during the month of March 2020.""

On April 17 this year, the American Department of State-led Overseas Security Advisory Council had produced a report in conjunction with the Regional Security Office at the US Consulate General in Lahore.

According to this report about rape incidents in Lahore, 101 such crimes were recorded and registered in 2017, there were 54 rapes in 2018 and 55 of such incidents had come to light in 2019.

In 2018, there were six gang rape incidents, dropping down to four in 2019.

Following this April 17, 2020, report, which had also highlighted carjacking numbers, assaults, armed robberies, home/shop invasions, theft of personal property and other violent crimes, the United States Department of State had assessed Lahore as being a ""High-Threat"" location.

Research further shows that by the end of February 2020, as many as 73 incidents of rape, including 5 gang-rape cases, were reported in Lahore.

As per the police record, 10 cases of gang rape were registered in 2019 while the number for the first two months of this year had rested at five.

Of the 10 cases registered last year, the police had arrested 28 accused after investigation.",['Sabir Shah'],"Chaudhary Sarwar had revealed: ""Pakistan is among the 10 worst countries when it comes to rape cases.

Division bench of Islamabad High Court comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Miangul Hassan conducted hearing the bail petition of former Housing Minister Akram Khan Durrani against the NAB inquiry for illegal allotment, illegal appointment, four armored vehicles and assets beyond his income. During hearing Chief Justice IHC Athar Minallah expressed annoyance with NAB prosecution team and remarked that whether the Bureau wanted to blackmail the court.

Justice Minallah inquired that when and under what law the house was allotted to IHC's Justice Aamir Farooq.

To this, NAB IO told the court that this allotment was made on merit.

To this Justice Minallah asked that then why Justice Farooq's name was included in this list. He further asked when an allotment was issued on his name. At this the NAB official answered that it was given in April 2019.

The Chief Justice remarked that whether this matter should be sent to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). Why these names were included in list and it was declared as confidential, he questioned NAB.

Justice Minallah remarked that did NAB think the court would hide this list whether the situation had reached at this extent.

The bench asked the NAB to provide the minutes of housing ministry's meeting dated August 2014. What was illegal if a Deputy Commissioner was allotted a house, he asked the NAB. The bench asked that whether the petitioner was part of this meeting.

Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb observed that whether the NAB would arrest IHC's Registrar who was part of the said meeting.

The NAB IO answered in no, at this Justice Aurangzeb said that then it would be wrong, the NAB should arrest the Registrar and Federal Secretary as well.

Justice Minallah remarked that if this list was produced with the approval of chairman NAB what law had been violated in this case, he questioned, adding that should the court summon NAB chairman to seek answer.

Additional Prosecutor General NAB Sardar Muzafar Abbasi adopted the stance that NAB prosecutor Jahanzeb Bharwana would give arguments on this matter but he was currently busy in Supreme Court.

The Chief Justice observed that the court would make this list public, adding that no judge of this court could be blackmailed.

The Chief Justice asked the NAB IO that why the name of IHC judge was added in the list when the Bureau knew that it was a legal allotment and why the list was declared as confidential.

Justice Athar Minallah observed that they would present themselves for accountability first. The court asked the Bureau to public the allotment list.

The Chief Justice asked that who had given the final approval of this list, to this the NAB IO said that the minister of the relevant ministry had approved this. Many things were in knowledge of this court, he observed and asked the NAB to tell what crime in it was, the court observed.

Chief Justice remarked that today the government was taking thousands of decisions, may be some of them would prove wrong later. If it was so then whether the NAB would start making cases against them, he asked.

If there was corruption, the NAB should lodge the case, Justice Minallah said, adding that now the Bureau had to tell that whether the judges were entitled for houses allotments or not.

The NAB IO said that the judges were entitled for houses. To this the Chief Justice remarked that then what was crime in this case.",['Obaid Abrar Khan'],"During hearing Chief Justice IHC Athar Minallah expressed annoyance with NAB prosecution team and remarked that whether the Bureau wanted to blackmail the court.

1410,423,653,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/711783-property-dispute-how-a-faisalabad-lawyer-kidnapped-killed-by-sukkur-police,,"Property dispute: How a Faisalabad lawyer kidnapped, killed by Sukkur Police","KARACHI: In an incident showing police penchant for barbarity, high-handedness and willful disregard for law, the Sukkur police kidnapped a senior lawyer from Faisalabad and tortured him to death in a private torture cell to oblige some influential persons.

According to official documentary evidences of correspondence between the Punjab and Sindh Police, available with this reporter, the murder of Mian Aijaz took place over a property dispute with his stepmother Shamim Bano.

Local police sources said Shamim Bano had migrated to Sukkur after the death of her husband, where she married Mian Asad Indhar, a local, and allegedly set up an ‘illegal business’ in partnership with Indhar, who is stated to be an influential person in Sukkur, having good ties with the local police, politicians, journalists and other notables.

Using his influence, Indhar allegedly got a fake case registered against Mian Aijaz, his wife Aqsa Rasheed and brother-in-law with the connivance of a main police officer of Sukkur in order to arrest and force him to surrender property in favor of his mother Shamim.

According to documentary evidences, the Sukkur Police got all the necessary approvals from the Punjab Home Department through the Sindh Home Department and constituted a special team to materialize the plan. The special team picked up Mian Aijaz from his Faisalabad home on August 17 and shifted him to a private torture cell in the Pano Aqil area of Sukkur. During his illegal detention, Mian Ijaz died from torture after which the Sukkur police allegedly dumped his body in the Bhong area of Sadiqabad – the bordering city of Punjab.

Inspector General of Police (IGP) Sindh Mushtaq Mahar took notice of the incident and directed SSP Sukkur Irfan Samon for an independent investigation. Additional Inspector General Sukkur Kamran Fazal wrote a letter, a copy of which is available with this reporter, to Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sukkur Fida Hussain Mastoi, expressing displeasure over the lawyer’s killing during custody at a private torture cell and dumping of his body at an unknown place to cover up the crime. The DIG was directed to transfer the case investigation to another district.

After the tragic death of Mian Aijaz, Police Station Cantonment, Pano Aqil, registered an FIR on August 23 against Assistant Sub-Inspectors (ASIs) Gul Hassan Seelro and Ghulam Mustafa Mirani and constables Yaqoob, Naseer and Dargah Dino for kidnapping Mian Aijaz from Faisalabad and then keeping him at a private place and torturing him to death. The case was registered on the complaint of SHO Allah Wadayo Pitafi.

The police arrested all the accused, including SHO Bashir Bhayo, and took their remand from a local court; however, Shamim and her two daughters are yet to be arrested.

On the second day of the incident (August 18), Mian Ijaz’s wife Aqsa Rasheed got an FIR registered with Police Station Madina Town, Faisalabad, and nominated Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Masood Rasool Mahar (presently posted as DSP City Sukkur), a few Sindh Police officials and some unknown persons, including two stepsisters, Sobia, Adila, and stepmother Shamim, of the deceased lawyer.

Talking to The News, Aqsa Rasheed said her husband had a property dispute with his stepmother and stepsisters and a court was trying the case. She alleged that by using their influence in the Sukkur police, Shamim and her two daughters, who are now residing in Sukkur, managed the kidnapping-cum-murder of her husband.

Local sources informed this reporter that there was a property dispute between Mian Aijaz and his stepmother and sisters. Shamim’s second husband Mian Asad Indhar allegedly used his influence and got a fake case of theft of jewelry registered with the Police Station Cantonment Pano Aqil against Mian Ijaz on the complaint of his driver. A special police team was constituted to arrest the lawyer and bring him to Sukkur.

The sources said to save the skin of senior officers involved in the incident, the Sukkur police registered a case against some junior officials, who were assured of release after reduction in pressure.

It is pertinent to mention that despite the orders of IGP Sindh and Additional IG Sukkur, the police took no step to arrest the three women despite the fact that they have been nominated in the FIRs lodged in Faisalabad and Sukkur. DSP Masood Mahar told this reporter that Ms Aqsa nominated him in the FIR due to some misunderstanding. Claiming an alibi, Mahar said on the day of incident, he was in the Sindh High Court, Sukkur bench, and in the evening, he attended an official meeting headed by SSP Sukkur.

SSP Irfan Samon told this reporter that the Sukkur police team committed an illegal act by picking up a person in an unauthorized manner and then keeping him at a private place where he died unfortunately. SSP Samon said a case had been registered against the responsible police officials and there would be an impartial investigation against all the involved persons. He said Sukkur police were doing their best to arrest the remaining accused, including the stepmother and stepsisters of the deceased lawyer.

This reporter tried to reach Mian Asad Indhar and Madam Shamim through their cell phone numbers to get their comments but got no response. On the other hand, CPO Faisalabad Muhammad Sohail has written a letter to the RPO informing him about availability of CCTV footages showing a Sindh Police mobile and a private car used in kidnapping of the lawyer.

He recommended that the RPO should contact the Sindh Home department through the Punjab home department to bring the accused for joining a fair investigation by Faisalabad police. On the recommendation of CPO Faisalabad, the Punjab Home Department has approached home secretary Sindh for the handover of the accused to the Punjab Police. In an official letter sent to the home secretary Sindh, a copy of which is available with The News, the IGP Punjab has requested for assistance in the handover of over 10 persons reportedly involved in the kidnapping cum murder of Mian Aijaz.

Sukkur police have arrested all the police officials, excluding DSP Mahar, and sent them to jail on judicial remand. However, to date no effort has been made to arrest Shamim Bano, her two daughters and Mian Asad Indhar.",['Imdad Soomro'],"The special team picked up Mian Aijaz from his Faisalabad home on August 17 and shifted him to a private torture cell in the Pano Aqil area of Sukkur.

Police arrested a man and a woman for their alleged involvement, suspecting they had tried to commit infanticide.

The incident took place in the Manzoor Colony area at around 8am, following which she was found on the street. A large number of locals gathered on the scene and informed the police. Volunteers of the Chhipa Welfare Association (CWA) took the baby to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC).

Citing witnesses, police said the infant was thrown off the second floor. Officials said the baby was alive and well, and was at a Chhipa child home. A man and a woman residing in the building have been arrested for further investigation.

Addressing a news conference, CWA founder Ramzan Chhipa said their control room had received information of the incident at 8am, adding that when a team of their volunteers reached the site, they found that the girl had survived. He said the doctors at the JPMC had provided her with the best treatment, adding that the girl had suffered an injury near the right eye.

Police said the girl was born at around 4am and was thrown off the building a few hours later. They suspect the child’s father had refused to accept the baby, which led to an argument, following which she was thrown off the building. Officials said the man and the woman who have been taken into custody for their alleged involvement in the horrendous crime have denied having any relation to the infant.",['Our Correspondent'],"A newborn girl survived after she was thrown off the second floor of a building in Karachi’s Baloch Colony neighbourhood on Tuesday.

They suspect the child’s father had refused to accept the baby, which led to an argument, following which she was thrown off the building.","['baby', 'building', 'newborn', 'floor', 'girl', 'man', 'took', 'woman', 'survived', 'second', 'chhipa', 'volunteers', 'thrown', 'survives']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-10/ss_756228_073601_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-11/ss_756658_045246_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-11/ss_756660_045408_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-11/ss_756656_045601_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-10/ss_756225_073249_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-10/ss_756222_072949_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-10/ss_756226_073312_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-10/ss_756227_073509_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-10/ss_756224_073212_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-10/ss_756221_072815_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-11/ss_756661_045528_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-10/ss_756229_073415_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-10/ss_756223_073024_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-11/ss_756659_045327_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-10/ss_756220_073054_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-11/ss_756657_045120_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'Newborn girl survives after being thrown off second floor | Karachi | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'A newborn girl survived after she was thrown off the second floor of a building in Karachi’s Baloch Colony neighbourhood on Tuesday.

Disgraced American actor Kevin Spacey is facing another lawsuit over sexual assault by actor Anthony Rapp and an anonymous man.

According to court papers, Rapp and the other accuser are alleging the House of Cards star of sexually assaulting them when they were 14.

Rapp, star of Star Trek: Discovery, had earlier opened up about the alleged encounter in 2017, saying Spacey had made unsolicited sexual advances towards him while he was only 14.



Filed on Wednesday, the lawsuit states that he met the ill-famed actor in 1986 while he was performing for Broadway’s Precious Sons, after which Spacey had invited him for a party at his Manhattan residence for a party.

Rapp further details in the Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit that the accused “intentionally and voluntarily and without plaintiff’s consent engaged in an unwanted sexual advance with a 14 year old and grabbed then infant plaintiff.”

The docs reveal how Rapp ran towards the bathroom and following a few minutes, headed for the exit before the actor “tried to persuade plaintiff to stay but plaintiff refused and quickly left the defendant’s apartment.”

The other alleged victim, who is going under the pseudonym of C.D. claims he and Spacey met while he was only 12 during an acting class that was being taught by him in 1981 in Westchester County.

Spacey invited C.D. to his apartment two years later where, the plaintiff recalls, he “engaged in sexual acts with plaintiff, C.D., while the plaintiff was 14 years old.”

As per the docs, the sexual encounters continued “on different occasions.”

He highlighted the important role of parliamentarians in reforming the police department across the country so that it could serve the masses in a more efficient manner and bring down the crime rate.

The 22-year-old, a member of India’s “untouchable” Dalit community, was allegedly raped by two men on Tuesday and died while being taken to hospital, police in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh said.

The latest assaults come months after four men were hanged for the 2012 gang rape and murder of a student on a bus in Delhi, a case that came to symbolise the nation’s problems with sexual violence.

Police said that two men in the latest case had been arrested on charges of gang-rape and murder, without giving further details on their identities. An investigation was under way and the suspects may be tried in a special fast-track court, they added.

“A rickshaw-wallah (driver) brought her home. (She) was thrown in front of our house. My child could barely stand or speak,” the NDTV news channel quoted her mother as saying.

The incident took place in Balrampur district in Uttar Pradesh state, around 500 kilometres from where the other Dalit girl was allegedly gang-raped in mid-September by four upper-caste men. The 19-year-old, who was left paralysed by her injuries, was rushed to hospital in New Delhi 200 kilometres away but died on Tuesday.",[],"The 22-year-old, a member of India’s “untouchable” Dalit community, was allegedly raped by two men on Tuesday and died while being taken to hospital, police in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh said.

The 18-month-old boy, Salman Usman, was kidnapped late on Wednesday night and the kidnappers had demanded Rs300,000 in ransom, warning the family of dire consequences in case they did not pay the amount.

The suspects arrested were identified as Dilshad, a labourer who hailed from Bhawalpur, and Omar, a contractor who hailed from Faisalabad.“Usman, the father of the abducted boy, runs an eatery and a motel in Sohrab Goth,” Federal B Industrial Area DSP Naeem Khan told The News.

Domestic violence is an evil that exists in every society.

But in patriarchal Madagascar, the problem is entrenched and seems bound to worsen in the coronavirus lockdown.

A third of women here say they have suffered gender-based violence at least once in their lives, according to a 2012 study monitoring UN development goals. Half of such attacks have occurred at home.

The high statistics are rooted in Madagascar´s traditions, in which the paramount social role is allotted to men and gender-based violence is considered a norm.

Nearly one in two people find it acceptable for a spouse to beat their intimate partner, according to the UN Population Fund.

“I often manage to satisfy him sexually. But there are times when I´m too tired and that is when blows just come flying,” said Soarolahy, after she had cooked dinner and fetched water for her six children.

In Madagascar, one of the poorest countries in the world, the cast-iron role of tradition is having a disastrous impact on women, said Simon Ravelojaona, coordinator of CECJ, a charity supporting victims of violence in the southern region of Ambovombe.

“Some women feel neglected if they are not beaten by their husbands,” he said.

People “don´t consider women as full members of society,” said Ravelojaona, listing examples of humiliations women ordinarily suffer. In Madagascar “a woman has no right to express herself. In case of a divorce she gets nothing from her husband. She inherits nothing. That´s what women´s life is,” he said.",[],"AMBOVOMBE, MADAGASCAR: -”When my husband is under too much stress, he takes it out on me,” said Maharo Soarolahy, a 34-year-old Madagascan villager.

ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly approved on Friday with a sizable majority a resolution demanding public hanging of the child abuse convicts.

The resolution was tabled in the lower house of the parliament by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) lawmaker and Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan. He said Prime Minister Imran Khan wanted hanging punishment for the child abuse convicts.

“When we raised the issue of public hanging in the National Assembly’s standing committee on human rights headed by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari it was opposed,” the minister said, adding the government desired a new law aimed at the hanging of the convicts.

He further asked the opposition if it was ready to support the bill or not. Another PTI lawmaker Imran Khattak also seconded the demand for adopting the resolution calling for public hanging of child abuse convicts.

Former prime minister and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) parliamentarian Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, however, opposed the move, saying the country had signed a United Nations Charter against public hangings and if it was adopted then the world would not accept it.

Federal Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry also shared his views on Twitter, opposing the resolution. “Strongly condemn this resolution. This is just another grave act in line with brutal civilisation practices [sic]. Societies [should] act in a balanced way, [barbarity] is not an answer to crimes. This is another expression of extremism,” he wrote.

Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari also spoke out against the resolution. “The resolution passed in NA today on public hangings was across party lines and not a govt-sponsored resolution but an individual act. Many of us oppose it — our Ministry of Human Rights strongly opposes this. Unfortunately, I was in a meeting and was not able to go to NA,” she said on Twitter. The Amnesty International on Friday condemned the passage of the resolution in the parliament, saying public hangings were acts of unconscionable cruelty. “The sexual abuse and murder of children are among the most horrific crimes, but the death penalty is not a solution. Public hangings are acts of unconscionable cruelty and have no place in a rights-respecting society,” said Amnesty International’s Deputy South Asia Director Omar Waraich.",[],"By News DeskISLAMABAD: The National Assembly approved on Friday with a sizable majority a resolution demanding public hanging of the child abuse convicts.

FAISALABAD: Fifteen men who are accused of gang-raping two sisters have still not been arrested by police, reported Geo News on Monday.



Out of the nominated suspects, six obtained interim bail from the court to avoid being arrested whereas efforts are being made to arrest the others who have nominated in the FIR, said the investigation officer Muhammad Aslam.

""DNA tests of the girls have been taken and the report will be received after three days,"" he said.

The complaint had been filed on behalf of the victims' mother, who had stated that her two daughters, one aged 17 years old and the other 15, were kidnapped on September 11 by a group of persons.

She said that her daughters were taken to different locations for six days where they were gang raped by the suspects, who allegedly intoxicated the teenage girls and took indecent photographs and recorded videos of them.

The FIR states that the 15-year-old girl was dropped off at Faisalabad's Jhang Bazar while her sister was left at Gujranwala before the suspects fled.

The woman had said that the family could not take legal action against the suspects on account of poverty hence they decided to leave their residence and settle somewhere else.

However, the suspects did not leave the family alone and continued to catcall and record videos of the teenage sisters wherever they went, stated the complaint.

According to the complaint, the two sisters were travelling with their mother on Millat Road a few days before the complaint was filed when the suspects started recording videos of the girls again.

On being told not to do so, they had allegedly assaulted the mother and her daughters before fleeing.",[],"— The News/FilesFAISALABAD: Fifteen men who are accused of gang-raping two sisters have still not been arrested by police, reported Geo News on Monday.

KARACHI: No evidence, in the Clifton gang-rape case, has been uncovered that proves that the woman was found in a partially conscious state, police probing the matter said Friday.



""After the incident, the girl travelled home by public transport,"" they said.



The case is mired with controversy owing to conflicting statements by police officers as they probe the facts.

According to a police report, samples from the woman's clothes have been taken and will provide a more conclusive picture of what transpired.

The report states that a wound was seen on the woman's arm, which ""seems to be self-inflicted"".

The investigative team said that the two main suspects in the case belong to Jacobabad and had purchased a flat in Clifton where they allegedly took the woman and gang-raped her.

""We have collected all the evidence related to the suspects,"" they said.

The police said that the prime suspect along with his cousin allegedly raped the victim in the presence of a domestic worker.

""We have sped up our efforts to apprehend the suspects,"" police said, adding: ""They have turned off their mobile phones and gone into hiding.""

They said that one of the numbers is registered in the name of the suspect's parents.

According to police, the incident in question occurred on September 21 and the victim's sister alerted the police on the 15 helpline the next day.

Evidence contrary to woman's claims

A senior police officer of the metropolis' South Zone had earlier raised doubts over the incident, saying it did ""not look like rape and kidnapping but it appears to be some other issue"".

Speaking to The News, the deputy inspector-general (DIG) for South Zone police, Javed Akbar Riaz, said: ""Investigators did not find any evidence or witness to suggest that the woman offered resistance during the entire episode.""

However, until the investigation is complete, ""nothing concrete can be established"", he added.

The closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage obtained by police seemingly shows her calmly walking away from the area where she was reportedly initially picked up.

Following the incident on Monday night, the 22-year-old, a working woman, along with her family, had claimed that she was kidnapped and later gang-raped in Karachi’s Clifton neighbourhood.

They claimed that she had gone out for snacks to a mall with a friend. Afterwards, two men in a double cabin vehicle allegedly kidnapped her from outside the mall. They took her to an apartment and where along with a third accomplice she was allegedly raped.

Initially, it was reported in the media that the young woman was found unconscious on Tuesday morning following her abduction on Monday night.

The police, however, said that she was picked up at around 9:30pm on Monday night and then dropped at around 11:30pm the same night. An FIR was registered at the Boat Basin police station.",[],"— The News/FilesKARACHI: No evidence, in the Clifton gang-rape case, has been uncovered that proves that the woman was found in a partially conscious state, police probing the matter said Friday.

SUKKUR: Police in Larkana said late Friday evening the prime suspect in the Kashmore gang-rape — wherein a woman and her child were sexually abused — has been killed by an accomplice.

According to the deputy inspector-general (DIG) of police for Larkana, Nasir Aftab, the main suspect who was arrested following the Kashmore gang-rape, Rafiq Malik, was shot dead by an accomplice as police drove him to an area to identify the whereabouts of others suspected of committing the crime.

After seeing him with police, Rafiq's accomplices opened fire at him, causing the suspect to be injured, DIG Aftab said, adding that Rafiq succumbed to his injuries en route to the hospital.

A second suspect named in the child abuse case, identified as Khairullah Bugti, was arrested during the operation, Aftab added.

The senior superintendent of police (SSP) for Kashmore, Amjad Shaikh, the arrested suspect disclosed various suspected locations of Bugti during interrogation and that he be taken to catch the absconding man.

As police reached the RD-09 Police Station near Bakhshapur, Bugti — who was hiding — opened fire at the police officials and killed Rafiq. They, however, managed to overcome Bugti, detained him, and recovered weapons from his possession, the cop added.

A police officer was also injured, SSP Shaikh said.

Security to be provided to mother, daughter

In a statement, the Larkana district administration said it had decided to provide security to the mother-daughter duo who were subjected to sexual abuse.

Police security will be present at the hospital during the minor girl's treatment, the district administration said, adding that they took the decision in light of the death of one of the suspects in the case.

They underlined that they were considering providing security to the two even after treatment.

Woman duped by men with promise of job

Earlier, a young woman from Karachi was duped by three men who took her to Kashmore with the promise of a job. They gang-raped her before selling her to Khairullah Bugti — a member of the gang — while the child remained with the other two.

The woman fled from Bugti's house and reached the local police station to file a complaint, following which, authorities tracked the men to the house where she was gang-raped and recovered the child.

It was then that police had arrested Rafiq, who later confessed to gang-raping the minor girl.",[],"The News/Imtiaz HussainSUKKUR: Police in Larkana said late Friday evening the prime suspect in the Kashmore gang-rape — wherein a woman and her child were sexually abused — has been killed by an accomplice.
