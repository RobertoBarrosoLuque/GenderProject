Most of us remember the story of seven years old Zainab Ansari, the rape and murder victim, whose body was found in Kasur in 2018. Her murderer has since been hanged, but the memory of the horrific crime lives on.

Unfortunately, another similar case has appeared, namely that of Marwah, a five-year-old girl kidnapped, raped and murdered in Essa Nagri area of the port city, Karachi. The autopsies revealed that she was raped and the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head before her body was torched in the garbage.

It is sad to see the justice system of Pakistan allows culprits to commit such heinous acts across the country. Every single government department can be blamed for such incidents since they don’t take any of these cases seriously.

But, still, I believe that the government will find out that culprit and hang him in the public so that no one can dare to commit such a flagitious crime.

The Aurat March 2020 has been dividing people in Pakistan: the cat’s out of the bag. And its a great thing that in the context of a hegemony of an intensely well-oiled patriarchal machine that dominates general discourses and practices, a new space for dissent is emerging, which is shaking the status-quo in creative manners. This is not to say that the current struggle for the emancipation of marginalised genders in Pakistan is unprecedented. The struggle has been fought on the fringes, historically, but there is a novelty about the current variant. While social media spaces have a tendency to make us more tribal, they allow for the possibility of a democratic space for resistance, simultaneously. The difference, I sense, is in the rising level of traction and popularity that the debate is receiving on a mass-level. That, in some ways, is unprecedented. Everybody has a take on the Aurat March, for good, or for worse.

Unfortunately, continuing on the trend from last year, a few placards seem to have almost taken the feminist narrative hostage. Debates on TV and social media outlets have been so cynically and strategically constructed that those fighting for the emancipation of marginalised genders from a progressive view point are forced into a defensive position. Most media outlets began the debate by criticising the slogan “Mera Jism, Meri Marzi” (my body, my autonomy) as a Western import, suggesting that it is corrupting our Easternness by advocating for sexual freedom. These are typical right-wing tactics of reducing a complex slogan with multi-pronged effects to a self-servicing footnote. The slogan condemns “marital rape, female genital mutilation, forced marriages, forced pregnancies, sexual assault, acid attacks, human trafficking, bonded labour, physical abuse, body shaming, sexual harassment, and child abuse” amongst other dimensions. Anyone in their right minds, and with half a heart, can relate to the gravity of these above-mentioned issues areas in “developing” Pakistan. The statistics do not lie. As referred to in an earlier column I wrote last year on this issue, in contemporary Pakistan, 90% of all women have faced sexual violence at some point in their lives. Around 80% domestic households in Pakistan have incidences of violence, where males are obviously the perpetrators. Pakistan ranked at 148 out of 149 countries in the ‘Global Gender Gap Index 2018’ report on gender parity, released by the World Economic Forum. 74% of all Pakistani women have less than 6 years of education. Pakistani women constitute 52% of the population, but make up only 24% of the labor force. Female share in wage employment is only 15% as they are engaged mostly as ‘family’ workers (54%), working without pay in the informal sector.

Detractors however seem to rejoice in painting the whole spectrum of the feminist resistance with one broad brush - that it is a Western agenda/conspiracy. If the language and vitriol that Khalil ur Rehman employed against Marvi Sirmed reflects those seemingly Eastern ethos, then there is a huge problem with your understanding of Easternness. And the production crew’s understanding of Easternness as well, as they let him abuse her, while his microphone had a considerably higher volume/gain setting so it overpowered Marvi’s voice. Was the anchorperson displaying a fidelity to her Easternness when she chose to not stop Khalil ur Rehman even once, tacitly siding with him in the onslaught? This shameful display of uncouthness and sheer vulgarity does not have anything to do with the higher ethical ideals of tolerance, compassion and respect for women that have been a hallmark of the Eastern way of life, at least the way I imagine it. The way Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, Sachal Sarmast, Bulleh Shah or Shah Hussain imagined it. If you still want to resort to the east-west dichotomy, there are certain things that Pakistani society needs to learn from the West, which includes a glaring amount of relative autonomy that has been granted to the women, as a consequence of the long and protracted feminist struggles in the last three centuries. If your conception of Easternness imagines women to be completely submissive to the will of the patriarch and rids them of their agency to Be, justifies honour killings, Wani and karo-kari, or refuses them the right to seek higher education, then you need to be released from your medieval imprisonment. The times they are a-changin’ and with the influx of the positive side of awareness that has been brought on by the juggernaut of globalisation and a widespread belief in universal human rights and civil and political liberties for all, you stand on the wrong side of history. Your misplaced paternalism and ill-founded misogyny have no reasonable space in the 21st century, and the sooner you accept that, the better it is for you, and definitely those around you.

While organisers and participants in the Aurat March revel in the hope that originates in collective gatherings of the sort, there is a need to maintain a sense of reality and not be swayed too much by the sheer numbers that showed up. The struggle needs to be articulated strategically in the political, cultural, academic as well as personal spheres, and this sort of change does not take place overnight. There is however a likelihood that the feminist struggle will manage to cut across boundaries of class, caste and creed as activists learn to unite on some essential shared ideals of equality and fraternity. The vibrant scenes in Sukkur, and elsewhere in Sindh, have silenced the cynics who reduce the struggle to be a plaything of some upper class individuals.

On both, the societal and state level, there needs to be a serious consideration to educate the marginalised genders and make them useful contributors to the economy. As the President of Pakistan recently advised female medical professionals not to be sacrificed at the altar of marriage after obtaining their degrees like many before them, there seems to be a growing realisation of the issue amongst some elements in our government. However, whilst the two main popular political parties, the PTI and PML(N) only gave restrained and rhetorical support to the marchers, it was only the Bilawal Bhutto Zardari led PPP which gave complete support to the Aurat Marches throughout the country - a bold and appreciable step.

ISLAMABAD - The Supreme Court of Pakistan Tuesday directed the trial court to conclude within three months the murder case of Amal Umer, a 10-year-old girl who lost her life when a stray bullet hit her during a police encounter on August 13, 2018.

A three-member bench of the apex court headed by Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed conducted hearing in a suo moto case of Amal Umer murder case.

During the hearing, Additional Advocate General (AAG) Sindh told the court that the two personnel who shot at Amal Umer were dismissed from service and a notification for the assistance has been issued to the victim’s parents as per the SC directives.

He also informed that the parents of victim girl have also been offered financial help as well. However, the Chief Justice observed that the girl had died as a result of police firing so what help the police could offer, adding financial help cannot be an alternative to one’s life.

Counsel for the Amal’s parents informed that an inquiry against National Medical Centre (NMC) has been completed. He submitted that as per investigation the National Medical Centre had tampered the documents and Sindh Healthcare Commission had imposed Rs0.5m fine on NMC.

He further submitted that negligence was made in shifting the victim to another hospital in critical condition. Similarly, he maintained that the Chairman National Medical Centre refused to accept the report and said that the Centre is not responsible for the child’s death.

Justice Gulzar Ahmed questioned as to why the Sindh government did not submit the report officially. Then the Chief Justice directed the Sindh Government to share its report with the parents of the victim and held that if they (parents) have any objection over the report they can submit it before the court.

When the Chief Justice asked about the present status of the instant case, the court was informed that a challan (charge sheet) has been submitted in the trial court.

Rawalpindi - A poor maid—mother of three children was strangulated to death allegedly after being assaulted sexually by unknown culprit in crops of sugarcane in Pidana Khurd area of Taxila, police informed yesterday.

The maid (45) was working in the house of a military officer in Multi Garden Housing Society in B-17 and used to go and come back from the way passing through sugarcane corps, the police added.

The woman was found dead in the corps by her husband Jamil who was searching for her after she did not return home, the police added.

On information, a heavy contingent of police including Homicide Investigation Unit (HIU) officials and Lady SI Shahida Yasmin headed by City Police Officer Muhammad Ahsan Younas, SSP Investigation Muhammad Faisal Kamran and SP Potohar Division Syed Ali rushed to the crime scene and collected evidences. They also shifted the dead body to hospital for autopsy.

The police also launched a FIR against unknown rapist-cum-killer with Police Station Taxila.

When contacted, a senior police officer told The Nation that it was suggested during the initial investigation that the movement of the victim was being monitored by some culprit or culprits as she was using the way to go and come back home from her work place.

He added the woman left her house at 9:30am on Monday for her workspace but could not reach there. On this, her husband started searching her and found her slipper in a muddy path leading to the sugarcane corps in the deserted area, he said. Using the shoe as a clue, the man reached the place where she was killed by unknown man after assaulting her sexually. “Woman was strangulated to death,” the police officer said.

He said it was also detected that the woman was caught by the culprit outside the sugarcane crops and dragged her into for committing the crime.

“We are investigating the blind murder case from all angles and would arrest the rapist very soon,” he vowed. He said the dead body of the woman was brought to hospital where doctors confirmed that the lady was raped before murder.

In a statement, CPO Muhammad Ahsan Younas said the police investigators have taken samples from the body of the deceased and dispatched to forensic lab for medical examination.

Meanwhile, a 12-year-old boy drowned in Soan River in the area of Sihal Pindh Malho Vilage in Chakri, according to Rescue 1122 spokesman.

ISLAMABAD - Prime Minister Imran Khan yesterday announced to bring a stringent and holistic Anti-Rape Ordinance next week in a bid to close all the loopholes.

Talking to Sindh Police Assistant Sub Inspector Mohammad Bux Buriro over phone, Imran Khan lauded him and his daughter for their exemplary initiative and courage in arresting the Kashmore rapist. The prime minister said that the nation is proud of ASI Mohammad Bux Buriro and her daughter for giving a positive uplift to the image of police.

""The nation is proud of them and ASI Buriro has given positive uplift to the image of police"", said the Premier in his tweet. A young woman from Karachi was duped by three men who took her to Kashmore with the promise of a job.

Later, they gang-raped her before selling her to Khairullah Bugti, a member of the gang, while the child remained with the other two. Later, she was let go on the condition that she would lure another woman. However, she approached the Kashmore police who helped her recover the daughter. On Thursday, Kashmore police arrested the suspect accused of kidnapping and gang-raping a woman and her five-year-old daughter.

A case was registered against Malak at the Kashmore police station under Sections 376, 344, 420 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code, pertaining to rape, unlawful confinement, cheating and dishonesty and common intention. Later, on the directives of Kashmore SSP Amjad Ali Shaikh, Section 365 of PPC, pertaining to kidnapping, and Section 6/7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act were inserted in the FIR. The FIR stated that the survivor was offered a job on October 25 and later travelled to Kashmore, where Malak and two of his accomplices detained her and her daughter, subjecting them to gang-rape at Malak’s residence.

According to the rape victim when she reached Kashmore, she said, she and her daughter were both sold and raped. ""The culprits let me go but kept my daughter in their captivity,"" she narrated. Malak later released the survivor, telling her he would only let her daughter go if she brought him another woman from Karachi. The police said they raided a place near RD-109 area to arrest another suspect, Bugti, but he opened indiscriminate fire on the police. The law enforcers, who claimed that they took Malak with them to identify Bugti, arrested the latter and seized the weapon with which he shot Malak.",['Our Staff Reporter'],"Share:ISLAMABAD - Prime Minister Imran Khan yesterday announced to bring a stringent and holistic Anti-Rape Ordinance next week in a bid to close all the loopholes.

Pakistan is an Islamic republic. The foundational principles of the creation of Pakistan are contrary to majoritarianism.

The constitutional framework of Pakistan defines, guarantees and protects the fundamental rights of all the citizens of Pakistan regardless of creed, clan and belief. Article 9 of the Constitution of Pakistan provides a comprehensive coverage for the safety and security of its citizens irrespective of religions and beliefs. Article 5 says, “Adequate provision shall be made for the minorities to freely profess and practice their religions and develop their cultures.” Our constitutional provisions depict that our minorities enjoy all fundamental rights. Article 51(4) provides 10 reserved seats for religious minorities in the National Assembly, and 24 seats for minorities in the four provincial assemblies under Article 106, while the Senate of Pakistan has four reserved seats.

The rights of minorities have been a long debated issue in the socio-political discourse of Pakistan. This discourse has led to the concoction of a narrative wherein the international media and nongovernmental organisations have been masquerading in building a negative image of Pakistan. Contrary to what prevails in media, Pakistan has been taking affirmative actions in dealing with the issues pertaining to the minorities’ rights. Government of Pakistan has taken initiatives such as opening of Kartarpur Corridor for Sikh pilgrims and the Katas Raj temple complex for Hindu pilgrims. In early 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that Christians would be able to register their marriages with an official marriage certificate. PM Imran Khan has also made very positive statements followed by taking strict actions about forced conversions to Islam and forced marriages. Our government also ensures equal justice and protecting minorities from violence, hate speech, and discrimination.

National Minorities Day is celebrated in Pakistan on August 11 every year to pay homage to the minorities for their pivotal role in the creation of Pakistan, development and progress. According to the latest statistics, Muslims make up 96.2 per cent of Pakistan’s population,

Hindus 1.6 per cent, Christians 1.59 per cent, scheduled castes 0.25 per cent, Ahmadis 0.22 per cent, and other minorities 0.07 per cent. Pakistan is the first country having special representation of minorities in its national flag.

The circumspect view of the history reveals that over the period of time, a chunk of foreign funded elements and individuals are conspiring to pitch the minorities against Muslims through conjectured and concocted tales in the name of forced conversions and marriages – an apparent manifestation of propaganda and disinformation. Such evil designs are aimed at portraying Pakistan as an unsafe country for the minorities. However, that is not the case, indeed. The situation is altogether contrary to what is being portrayed by few hate-mongers and propagandists under the aegis of hostile powers. The so-called standard bearers of human rights remain in deep slumber on the issues of atrocities being inflicted upon the innocent Kashmiri brethren in IIOJK.

Since independence, Quaid-e-Azam promised equal opportunities to all citizens. Pakistan’s founding father imagined an enlightened, democratic and open-minded society that recalled its Muslim character whilst giving equal rights, opportunities, and respect to its non-Muslim citizens. There is neither discrimination against minorities in Pakistani Constitution nor exists any hostility at the level of Pakistani society.

The rape cases have become rampant in Pakistan. Lately, the cases like brutal gang rape, child abuse, and killing of transgender people have been reported but our leaders seem to be in deep slumber. No practical action has been taken against the criminals. Despite taking any punitive action against these monsters, the authories and the police officials are giving daunting statements to the media. They are incriminating the harassed woman instead of the culprits. That is sadly an ill-mentality of our society. Now it seems impossible for a woman even to step out of her house. PM Imran Khan had vowed to turn Pakistan into “Riyasat e Madina” but he seems to be pulling back of his promise.

The burgeoning cases are evidence that PTI seems to have failed miserably in bringing Islamic justice in the country. However, the people now have anger against the authorities because of their futile investigation processes. They are demanding to hang those rapists publically to create a deterrent example for other malevolent culprits, which is right. We exhort the authorities and other personnels to punish these rapists no less than public hanging because these people are a nuisance for our country who can dash our prosperity and peace into dire.

Domestic violence and abuse can happen to anyone, it does not discriminate. It is used for one purpose: to gain and maintain total control over an individual. An abuser doesn’t play fair. An abuser uses fear, guilt, shame, and intimidation to wear you down and keep you under their thumb. It occurs within all age ranges, ethnic backgrounds, and economic levels. And while women are more often victimised, men also experience abuse, especially verbal and emotional abuse. The bottom line is that abusive behaviour is never acceptable, whether from a man, woman, teenager, or an adult. You deserve to feel valued, respected, and safe.

Domestic abuse often escalates from threats and verbal assault to violence. And while physical injury may pose the most obvious danger, the emotional and psychological consequences of domestic abuse are also severe. Emotionally abusive relationships can destroy your self-worth, lead to anxiety and depression, and make you feel helpless and alone. No one should have to endure this kind of pain and your first step to breaking free is recognising that your relationship is abusive.

Many men and women suffer from emotional abuse, which is no less destructive. Unfortunately, emotional abuse is often minimised or overlooked even by the person experiencing it. If you suspect that someone you know is being abused, speak up! If you’re hesitating, and telling yourself that it’s none of your business, or that the person might not want to talk about it, you might be wrong. Keep in mind that expressing your concern will let the person know that you care and may even save their life.

Gender-Based Violence is “one of the most serious challenges of our time,” according to an in-depth study on violence against women conducted by the United Nations Secretary General (2006). Effective legislation directed towards crimes against women are crucial in combating practices that perpetuate heinous practices and provisions on such violence are often found in most civil, criminal and administrative codes of most nations. However, they remain highly inadequate in their “scope, remedy and implementation.”

Sexual violence continues to be a heinous crime in Sindh as well. Between the years 2013 to 2019, three hospitals in Karachi alone reported 2,500 rape cases and 593 sodomy cases. In 2019, there were over 545 cases of sexual assault reported at these hospitals, out of which 407 were rape cases and 138 were sodomy cases, estimated at least 2 sexual violence cases per day. As the statistics increase, the conviction rate in Pakistan for such cases remains as low as 3 percent, all while cases remain underreported despite the recent amendments in rape laws.

Along with the various existing deterrents to the successful resolution of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) cases, such as extended trial time and inadequate special protection measures in courts, many officials within the criminal justice system have inadequate knowledge, training and skill for handling sexual and gender-based violence crimes, thereby leading to ineffective investigations of such crimes. The way police and investigation officers respond to GBV cases continues to be a major concern across the globe, including sectors such as different criminal justice agencies, specialist support services and the media. Investigation officers, in any given crime, consider factual objectives, operational tactics and act as a liaison for legal strategy when investigating a crime. This means their primary objective is to collect, confirm and analyse facts with a goal to produce compelling evidence.

Various countries around the world, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, have established specialised police units that seek to improve victim care, the quality of investigation undertaken, and inter-agency working of all actors within the criminal justice system involved. These are specialised divisions or units consisting of investigation officers who specifically investigate crimes that fall under the category of GBV offences. The primary responsibilities undertaken by investigation officers in this Unit include attending to a victim, preserving evidence on the victim i.e., not taking a shower or removing clothes worn during the act of sexual violence, securing and protecting the scene of the incident, apprehending the offender, if possible, assessing and referring the victim to special needs, such as psycho-social counselling, and explaining the investigation process with steps forward to the victim and their family, etc. In the United Kingdom, the “Sexual Offences Investigation Trained Officer” (SOIT) were created whose primary roles was to act as a first responder to allegations of a sexual offence, gather relevant evidence and information from the victim for investigative purposes and secure their confidence and trust in the case.

The steadily rising number of incidents and GBV crimes, and their heinousness being committed across Pakistan reveal that the criminal justice system, particularly the police is showcasing negligence in investigation. A study conducted by the Legal Aid Society, “Gap Analysis on Investigation and Prosecution of Rape and Sodomy Cases in Sindh” reveals that it takes the police approximately 1.6 months to finish investigation and submit a final challan, accounting for 53.3 percent of the total time required to complete a case within the legislative 3-month period. Thus, resulting in compromised evidence and delays in the overall case. Looking at the international examples of success, the police response to such incidences requires not just standard technical knowledge, as is provided in Pakistan, but also an understanding of the gendered aspects of such cases, which must influence how they conduct their investigation and build up evidence. It also requires a nuanced and sensitised approach to the entire case, with a particular emphasis on protecting the victim, whilst recognising the challenge of the social space and order within which they are working.

The establishment of specialised units necessitate the immediate implementation of law to mitigate the issue at hand. The Anti-Trafficking Unit, for example, acts as a body to monitor, prevent and punish those involved in human smuggling. Its success highlights a total of 7037 cases being registered in 2018 and 18 of the most-wanted traffickers/smugglers arrested the same year. Similarly, the similitude of success of a Specialised Cadre of Investigation Officers particularly for GBV cases cannot be denied. It is such measures that affirm better evidence collection and subsequently, more efficient trials and conviction rates.",['Nisa Hafeez'],"Between the years 2013 to 2019, three hospitals in Karachi alone reported 2,500 rape cases and 593 sodomy cases.

They appealed to Chief Justice of Sindh High Court to prove justice in the case so that they could take a sigh of relief.","['told', 'sukkur', 'test', 'protest', 'khairpur', 'justice', 'disclosed', 'accused', 'victim', 'parents', 'rape', 'arrested', 'victims', 'gang', 'girl']","{'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/rsss.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/android_app_on_play_logo_small.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/g_plus.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/linkedin_share.png', 'https://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619912693.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png?date=2019-02-15', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/twitter.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_publishrr.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/utube.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/uploads/theme/logo-1550475639.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619902433.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/whatsapp_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/facebook.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/app-store.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2021-05-02/so-what-disaster-are-we-writing-about-today-stories-today-pandemic-pverty-scandal-1619896356-6502.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png'}",True,https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nation,,2021-02-28

Earlier on Friday, Johnny Depp revealed on his Instagram that he had been asked by Warner Bros to step down from his role as the character Grindelwald in the ""Fantastic Beasts"" movie franchise and added that he would appeal a UK court decision to decline his libel action.

Following the news that Johnny Depp had been forced to exit the Fantastic Beasts franchise, no longer portraying the evil wizard Gellert Grindelwald, social media exploded in outrage, and flocked online to voice support for the actor.

Insisting that firing Depp was an unfair move by Warner Bros., netizens launched several trending hashtags such as #JusticeForJohnnyDepp, #JohnnyDeppIsMyGrindelwald and #JohnnyDeppIsInnocent.

Depp was asked to step down as Grindelwald after a UK court declined his defamation suit and refused to clear him of the ""wife-beater"" label that The Sun applied to him when alleging Depp's domestic abuse toward ex-wife, Amber Heard.

Many online expressed their anger.

​Some insisted that Hollywood should have sacked Heard from the ""Aquaman"" movie, slamming movie producers for being biased on issues of domestic abuse.

​Many users took to Twitter to accuse Heard of taking advantage of feminism and making it even harder for men to tell their stories of domestic abuse.

​Many Fantastic Beasts fans got so angry that they immediately stated that they would boycott the upcoming third film sequel because Depp would no longer be portraying the notorious wizard.

ISLAMABAD - While Covid-19 related lockdowns may have decreased the spread of a deadly virus, they appear to have created an environment for increased domestic violence, a new study suggests.

The study, published in the journal American Behavioral Scientist, indicates that 39 per cent respondents reported having experienced violence in their relationship and 74 per cent of those people were women.

“The pandemic, like other kinds of disasters, exacerbates the social and livelihood stresses and circumstances that we know lead to intimate partner violence,” said lead researcher Clare Cannon from the University of California - Davis.

According to the researcher, the extra stress can also cause mental health issues, increasing individuals’ perceived stress and reactions to stress through violence and other means, Medical Daily reported.

For the study, the team involved 374 participants who completed an online survey about previous disaster experience, perceived stress, their current situation as it relates to Covid-19, if they experienced intimate partner violence, and what their personal and household demographics were.

Respondents, whose average age was 47, were asked about how Covid-19 had affected them financially and otherwise.

The researchers also found that 10 per cent of the sample reported experiencing intimate partner violence, the people that had experienced that violence reported more stress than the segment of the sample that had not experienced it.

Furthermore, the results show that as perceived stress increased, participants were more likely to end up as victims of violence.",['Our Staff Reporter'],"Share:ISLAMABAD - While Covid-19 related lockdowns may have decreased the spread of a deadly virus, they appear to have created an environment for increased domestic violence, a new study suggests.

I look around and witness that many girls in my life have suffered from sexual harassment at least once. There are laws in Pakistan for the sexual harassment with girls. And thus, I have so many questions in my mind.

Why is our government not taking any step against this brutality? Why is the state not enforcing these laws? Why is the honour of women being tarnished in Islamic society? Why are women considered so helpless and weak? The patriarchal structure of our society has led women to feel unsafe all the time and also has led to many girls deprived from their basic human rights such as education. It’s my appeal to government to take necessary steps to counter this atrocity. This is to ensure that women can feel safe and secure and can utilise their skills and abilities at the maximum.

Equality between men and women was an unquestioning feature in Quaid’s vision of the state. While addressing the Muslim University of Aligarh on March 10, 1944, he said in a sky-high way, “No nation can rise to the height of glory unless your women are side by side with you. We are victims of evil customs. It is a crime against humanity that our women are shut up within four walls of the houses as prisoners. There is no sanction anywhere for the deplorable condition in which our women have to live.” Contemporary Pakistani society is not much different from the above stated description and contains full male biases which cause women to face discrimination at multiple levels and experience a loss of opportunities.

Former World Bank country director, Illango Patchamuthu, during Human Capital Summit 2020, said that women’s economic power and education is essential for the sustainable development of the country. Furthermore, an additional schooling year adds up to nearly 10 percent in their future income. Also, he emphasised that giving access to information, finance, assets, and expanding their skills would boost 30 percent in the economy. Thus, Pakistan must focus on this untapped potential by working on an inclusive framework, policies, and practices to let women in the labour force.

Sadly, a majority of Pakistani girls experience societal pressure, especially about marriage. As per UNICEF, with an estimated 2 million child brides, Pakistan ranked as sixth highest country in terms of child marriages. Forced marriages and early aged marriages have contributed to female dependency, a vicious cycle of domestic violence, and loss of an economic resource. According to a research, putting an end to child brides’ culture could add $6229 million dollars to the economy.

Career and education is at stake when girls get married early and its repercussions are high on a socio-economic level. Out of the total population, 49 percent are women but they only contribute 24 percent to the labour force while men’s contribution is 76 percent. The unemployment rate of women is also double in comparison to men and stands at 9 to 10 percent. In urban areas, this unemployment graph goes upward to 20 percent. Our employment to population ratio is also devastatingly low, that is, 20 percent in the case of women. In contrast, men’s employment to population ratio is 64 percent. Therefore, th ere is no doubt in Pakistan’s ranking at 151 amongst 153 countries as per Global gender report in terms of equality between women and men.

In Pakistan, 21 percent of girls get married before 18 years while 3 percent before 15 years of age. In contrast, women of economically sound nations get married in their late twenties. For instance, Denmark 28.2 years, Japan 29.4 years, Korea 30.2 years, and England 35.5 years. Furthermore, their female population has access to education, liberty, equal opportunity, and employment facilities. However, the Pakistani situation is very daunting. Traditional customs like bartering for girls, marrying girls off before their birth, patriarchal norms by fixing honour boards on girls, family and tribal marriages, and pseudo beliefs like marrying off girls at the start of puberty are adding fuel to fire.

No doubt, Sindh was the first province to enact laws for restraining the child bride culture in 2014 by declaring marriage before 18 as a crime. Contrastingly, the recent decision of the Sindh high court in February, 2020 in case of Huma’s abduction, forced conversion, and marriage at age of 14 by his abductor, Abdul Jabbar has set precedence and allowed men to marry women after their first period. Furthermore, most violent cases that fall under criminal courts are transferred to family courts at district level courts. These developments are institutionalising domestic abuse and tearing the societal fabric.

In this distressing scenario, it’s high time for the nation to wake up and act towards inclusivity otherwise the future seems bleak. Reconstruction of thought on gender norms across all levels can help in curbing ill practices. First of all, knowledgeable skills and training must be imparted intensively to judicial magistrates and police officials for better handling of violence and abuse matters rather than dismissing as family matters. In addition, embedding gender equality ideas in the national curriculum would help children in recognising and rejecting abusive behaviour. The state ought to promote literature and media projects (dramas, films, documentaries and more) that depict women as autonomous and intolerant to any kind of abuse.

We all know that 2020 is the worst year. We have been going through the incurable coronavirus. This year, Pakistan, specifically Karachi, recorded the heaviest rainfall. And now sexual harassment, raping, kidnapping and murder cases are strengthening its roots here.

From Zainab’s case until today, the media have covered hundreds and hundreds of such cases. In the last week, a transgender social activist was killed, a 5-year-old girl got raped and a mother of two got gang-raped in front of her children.

Where are the laws? Where are the authorities? Where is justice? Who are the culprits? Have they been captured? No one knows.

Pakistan is an Islamic state. Our religion has given equal rights to both the genders. The constitution of Pakistan has laws according to our religion so why are these rapists are roaming freely? Why is it that girls, women, minor boys and even infant babies are not safe in our country? Why is such a shameful act is getting normalized in our society? We want justice. The rapist should be hanged in public.

It’s high time to cater to this situation. I request all the authorities, courts, media and elite to listen to our voices, bring those culprits and hang them in front of all.

Chief Minister of Punjab, Usman Buzdar, has taken the right step by launching “Nai Zindagi” programme for poor acid attack victims. The initiative will indeed prove a milestone in assuaging the miseries and hardships the acid attack survivors. The government’s decision to bear all treatment expenses and rehabilitation of such patients will give them the social rights that the previous governments failed to bestow upon them. For this kind and humane initiative, the government deserves all-out praise.

The fact that the programme also entails the provision of interest-free loans to the acid attack victims tells us that the initiative also aims to empower them financially. Almost nine years ago, the parliament passed the Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Act, 2011 to prevent such incidents. The legislation indeed proved instrumental in bringing acid attacks down. However, a state-led initiative to safeguard the rights of acid attacks survivors was missing so far.

However, the project will become more successful if the government ensures that the survivors find jobs in different organisations as per their skills. Such a scheme for the survivors—who are discriminated against in the job market—will allow them to rebuild their lives.

That said, it is, however, necessary for the government to recognise that the acid attacks are part of the widespread gender-based violence (GBV)—often against girls and women. Pakistan has indeed seen a substantial decrease in acid attacks in 2019 compared to the previous years. But the overall GBV still haunts Pakistani society. As long as our efforts against GBV remain insufficient, people, especially women, will stay vulnerable.

Nevertheless, considering the decline in the cases of acid attacks, the government can join hands with non-profit organisations that are working to eradicate acid violence from Pakistan completely. Together with such NGOs, the government can stop acid and burn violence and prevent the proliferation of such brutal happenings.",[],"Share:Chief Minister of Punjab, Usman Buzdar, has taken the right step by launching “Nai Zindagi” programme for poor acid attack victims.

Colombo-Sri Lankan police on Sunday arrested a self-proclaimed exorcist after a nine-year-old girl she had beaten as part of a ritual died.

The unidentified woman allegedly struck the girl repeatedly with a cane, claiming it was a way to drive out a demon that had possessed the child, said police spokesman Ajith Rohana. The girl’s parents had taken her to the woman in the village of Meegahawatte, just outside the capital Colombo, where neighbours responded to the cries of the child but not in time to save her, Rohana added.

“The child had collapsed after the severe beating she received. She was found dead on admission to hospital,” he said. There have been a number of such alleged exorcism attempts in the area in recent years, police added, with some causing physical harm -- including death.

Many in Sri Lanka seek help from witch doctors, self-proclaimed sorcerers and exorcists for help with various problems. Recently, health minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi publicly consumed a syrup made by a “god man” who had claimed it would give lifelong immunity from Covid-19.

Women, despite being the backbone of a family and an essential being of society, are regrettably bearing the burden of poverty, repression, subservience, barbarousness, and pervasive sexism in Pakistan. A developing country that is striving hard to manage its internal affairs and is simultaneously confronted with numerous regional grievances is intensely lagging behind on gender-related issues. Although women constitute around 50 percent of the entire population, yet gender-inequality and disparity remained one critical issue since independence. A nation with a vision to empower women, support minorities, and respect all religions has endangered and suffocated the ones who constitute half of the entire population of this country.

The disparity and inequality in terms of gender or caste are not limited to Asia or Africa; it is a worldwide phenomenon. Its existence is visualised and experienced in the remuneration and opportunities offered to women in various classes and regions. Western countries realised the importance and capabilities of women in other fields (mostly male-dominated) of life earlier, so they tried their best to support them by providing security, liberty, opportunities, etc. In that case, Pakistan is an exception for the reason that for many years, it is constantly ranked on the third, fourth, sixth, and second-worst countries in the world with regards to its women. This is because gender discrimination and inequality are deeply rooted in society and has turned out to be an enormous threat which is also hampering the country’s progress.

The cases of domestic violence, sexual harassment, molestation, kidnapping, male chauvinism, honour killings, acid attacks, and rapes are on the rise. According to reports it is estimated that around 70-90 percent of women in Pakistan have suffered physical, psychological, sexual, and emotional abuse. In one of the reports, the number of cases related to sexual violence between the years 2004-2016 was around 4,734, the registered honour crime cases were 15,000 while 5,500 and 1,800 cases were related to kidnappings and domestic violence respectively. However, the media reports the number of cases of violence against women from January 2011 to June 2017 was more than 51,241.

An enormous upsurge in the cases regarding child sexual abuse, rape, and violence was witnessed in the year 2018 and onwards. In the duration of only 8 months from January to August 2018, the provincial capital of Punjab reported 77 cases of rape of minor girls only. One of the most highlighted and devastating rape and murder case among all those was of Zainab-a six-year-old girl from Kasur, Punjab. Moreover, in 2019 the number of rape cases was 3,881; child sexual abuses were around 1,359; there were 1,758 cases related to violence against women, while cases concerning the kidnapping of women and honour killings were 12,600 and 197 respectively.

For several years, women have been facing one of the cruellest and unimaginable forms of violence that includes acid attacks by jilted lovers, former psychotic partners, or filthy family members. The records revealed the number of acid attack victims in 2010 was 30, while 75 in 2011, 96 in 2012, 67 in 2013, 84 in 2014, more than 49 in 2015, 71 in 2016-2017, and 62 cases in between 2018-2019. Furthermore, there are several recent cases of vitriol attacks in May and August this year where the accusers of such brutal acts are either ex-fiancé or a madrassah teacher, or in some cases, a husband. The ratio of vitriolage is decreasing whereas the ratio of rape and paedophile cases is increasing on a daily basis. A woman is raped every 2 hours in Pakistan whereas 7 children per day fall prey to abusers.

The major concern that arises after looking at the wide-ranging laws proposed in different years in support of women lies in the effectiveness they hold. To nobody’s surprise, all such efforts provided minimal prominence to women of a society where the respect she gains is highly superficial. This is a society where there is an ingrained dislike of women and where misogynistic and abusive remarks are shared against women on talk shows and social media platforms; a society where a mother of two is gang-raped on a highway in Pakistan and the police officials, instead of accusing the abusers, blame the lady for being out late at night. Victim blaming has become a norm in this highly patriarchal society and is evident from the investigations carried by the police especially in sexual assault cases.

The list of heinous and vicious incidents grows by many folds by each passing day and year. There are several reasons for this surge. First, it is the carelessness of our leaders that pay little to no heed towards these brutal crimes. Second, it is the misogynistic, belittling, and victim-blaming attitude of the police and people that hinders the victims to even file a complaint against the culprits. Third and the most important is the conviction rate that is not even 2.5 percent of all the reported cases by the courts. Forth it is the humiliation that young girls and women have to face in the form of a hymen test; it is like one rape over another and is forbidden in many states but not in Pakistan. The 2010 case of Uzma Ayub from Karak District is proof of that.

Since such tests are a violation of human rights and extreme torture to women, therefore they must be prohibited on an immediate basis. All those things including pornographic and abusive material on sites and TV, that tempt and lure the individuals to commit such crimes must be censored and completely banned. It’s high time that the rapists must be held accountable and punished severely without any delay, that too with the help of police so they may regain their trust among the masses. Our society doesn’t need more rape victims like Mukhtaran Mai. Therefore, the acknowledgment of such heinous crimes among cultural and national issues is the need of the hour.

The National Assembly (NA) only yesterday passed a resolution that calls for public hanging of offenders for sexually abusing and murdering children. Once again, our legislators chose the easy way out for the rampant menace of child abuse, i.e., public hanging of the abusers. But easy solutions do not always prove to be the best.

Remember Javid Iqbal who had murdered at least one hundred children after abusing them? The court awarded him capital punishment in the strictest manner. Did that eradicate the menace of child abuse from society? No, that didn’t. Fast forward to Zainab’s case. Did the issue of child sexual abuse vanish into thin air with the uproar after the horrific murder of Zainab? No, it didn’t. After every such heinous crime the Pakistani public relies on emotions rather than rational faculties. This is the case with the resolution in question as well.

The fact that even some members of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), including ministers Fawad Chaudhry and Shireen Mazari, opposed the resolution shows that even the government is divided on whether such punishment will ever be useful in curbing the menace of child sexual abuse. Shireen Mazari, the Human Rights Minister, says that it is not government-sponsored. Perhaps, she’s telling the truth.

However, the question worth asking is this: why do members of the ruling party act in an individual capacity and not consult the cabinet on such important issues that need thorough deliberations? Moreover, the mover of the resolution was not an ordinary legislator. Ali Muhammad Khan, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs, presented it. The opposition of at least two sitting ministers to the resolution suggests the lack of coordination and working relationship among the cabinet members.

Nevertheless, the passing of the said resolution is highly disappointing. Such frivolous and superficial changes will do little to fix the problem on the ground. Without increasing funding for policing or setting up better facilities, undetected child abuse will continue. This argument is corroborated by the fact that even after the introduction of the death penalty for raping a minor, the menace of child abuse did not subside. In fact, since then, the cases of child abuse have increased.

Returning to inhumane and brutal execution methods after becoming a signatory to international conventions preventing capital punishments is a foreign policy mistake and moral regression to boot. It is clear that the death sentence does not deter crime. Countries who execute commonly cite the death penalty as a way to prevent people from committing a crime. This claim has been repeatedly discredited, and there is no evidence that the death penalty is any more effective in reducing crime than life imprisonment.",[],"Once again, our legislators chose the easy way out for the rampant menace of child abuse, i.e., public hanging of the abusers.

France's largest business group on Monday backed the country's president amid his controversial claims about Islam, despite widespread protests and boycott calls in Muslim countries.

In an interview with the private RMC Radio, the chairman of France's largest employer's union, MEDEF, characterized the international backlash to Emmanuel Macron's comments as ""blackmail.""

""We must put our principles before the possibility of developing our business,"" said Geoffroy Roux de Bezieu, urging companies not to buckle under a boycott on French goods.

His comments came after a recent announcement by Macron on his controversial plans to crack down on what he dubbed ""Islamist separatism"" in France.

Macron's remarks sparked huge controversy and a boycott of French goods, including dairy products and cosmetics, by multiple Muslim countries, including Qatar, Jordan, Kuwait, Iran, Turkey and Pakistan. Demonstrations have also taken place with posters of Macron's set alight in some instances.

The French president made the statements in the wake of the recent murder of teacher Samuel Paty outside Paris.

Samuel Paty, a 47-year-old father who taught history and geography at Bois-d'Aulne College in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, was brutally murdered by Abdullakh Anzorov, an 18-year-old man of Chechen origin.

The teacher, during one of his classes on freedom of expression, had shown the controversial cartoons depicting Prophet Muhammad, according to the reports. Anzorov was killed by police in the aftermath of the attack. An investigation is ongoing.

The murder also gave rise to a massive police probe involving over 80 investigations and multiple suspects being questioned and taken into custody.

Last Thursday, Macron led a tribute to Paty in Paris, along with high-ranking French officials. In his speech, Macron said Paty's death was an act of ""gratuitous terrorism.""

The PTI government has evidently decided that there is no time to lose in bringing about legislation to curb the incidence of rape in the country. Similarly, these expand the definition of rape and incorporate within it the terms, transgender and gang rape and widen the scope of punishment to include chemical castration.

Moreover, a series of bone-chilling rape cases of late have left the public shaken and the government scrambling to appear proactive. There was, for example, the gang rape late one night in September of a woman in front of her children while they were stranded in their stalled car on the Lahore -Sialkot motorway. Besides, earlier this month, a mother and her minor daughter were raped over two days in Kashmore, Sindh, an incident particularly horrific in its details. Thus the expansion of the currently narrow definition of rape in terms of what acts constitute this crime and who can be defined as victims is an appropriate step. However, the proposal of chemical castration is problematic, and several rights advocates also contend that castration of rapists is based on a misunderstanding of the crime of rape, which is about power, not sexual gratification. Further, Pakistan is increasingly drifting away from its claim upon partially lifting the moratorium on capital punishment in December 2014 that it would apply it only to those convicted of terrorism. Hence, the proposed legal changes should go through the normal democratic procedure of being tabled in parliament, debated and then enacted as law.

She had to survive to hear from a very responsible police officer that she, somehow, called for it, by (deliberately) not checking up on the fuel levels of her vehicle and by choosing an extremely inappropriate time to travel “alone” with her kids and that she should have chosen GT Road instead, because GT Road is surrounded by densely populated areas with rich traffic inflow. Another free “wisdom nugget” that the officer offered her was that she should not have been traveling alone, to begin with.

So, listening to this timely lecture on how the rape victim was more or less, responsible for “creating a situation” where her car ran out of fuel and the rapists were probably left with no other option but to break the driver’s seat window using stones and dragging her and her children out of the car and raping her ruthlessly, followed by them looting her cash, jewellery and ATM cards.

Sources revealed that the woman was a French national and she had brought her kids to Pakistan to show the culture and values around. Little did she know how the land of pure was going to be introduced to the little ones.

The CCPO Lahore, Umar Sheikh’s statement, was followed by a snide remark, “The woman might have thought that she was in France. She needed to know she wasn’t” which enraged every sensible and sensitive soul in Pakistan, as it not only lacked empathy for the victim but also offered this (weak, untimely and totally unnecessary) defence of the rapists, even if his intention was not so.

His insistence on forcing his opinion on all and complete reluctance to retract and replace it with a more empathetic message added fuel to fire, and eventually the real message got lost and a new politically motivated debate took over print, electronic and digital media, where some of the incumbent government’s supporters began to justify the police officer’s statement full of suggestions on what the victim should and should not have done, claiming that it was his genuine concern for women. The opposition parties, the hard-core feminists, civil society members and a majority of the supporters of the PTI government viewed it to be a highly irresponsible and untimely message, signalling the crime to make sense as the victim’s precautionary measures were not in place.

This genuinely dangerous issue which needed to be viewed using an enviably cohesive national lens, fell prey to political angling, where the opposition’s sole focus turned to the “removal of CCPO, Lahore for his ill-chosen statement” rather than emphasising on the arrest of the culprits. The government missed his statement outside the off-stump, as they say in cricket, lending him the margin to handle the situation better next, without the CM Punjab, Usman Buzdar, sternly telling him off and warning him to work on how and when to say what to whom.

All said and done, one tends to ponder that it is not really about the victim being well-prepared or ill-prepared to defend themselves, but about the habitual predators getting away with this heinous crime time and again, while the country debates on them being publicly executed or not.

From the seven-year old Zainab getting sexually assaulted and murdered to the mother of three getting brutally raped right in front of her children, one can say with absolute certainty that it is all about the sick mentality of the habitual rapists and inability of the weak system of the country to take them to task, make an excellent example out of them. The encouraging part is that this woman’s suspected culprits got caught red-handed while using her stolen ATM Card yesterday. The thorough investigation leading to DNA profiling is underway. While we hope to see the DNA profiling results connect the dots, the real question remains:

Will the culprits be punished this time around? Or will they be set free only to pounce upon their next victim? Also, why did the Highway Police have to wait for this nerve-wrecking incident to jolt them to place the security staff resource on Highway after six months of this Lahore-Sialkot Motorway being fully operational with no security arrangements in place?

The State has to answer this stream of questions, as they echo in every nook and corner of Pakistan today. The sooner the State turns these “why’s” into “you’re in safe hands” and “valuable suggestions to the masses on when, where and how they should travel” into “we ensure your safety inside and outside your houses, irrespective of your class, creed, age gender and ‘precautionary arrangements’”, the better. Pakistan Zindabad!",['Maleeha Hashmey'],"Another free “wisdom nugget” that the officer offered her was that she should not have been traveling alone, to begin with.

An ongoing debate on the controversial draft of a ""separatism"" bill has sparked criticism, resulted in a diversion, dividing the house on the question of veil, whether to include amendments to ban veiled students at the university and accompanying parents from displaying any religious symbols at school premises.

Several parliamentarians on Tuesday have deemed the move to be counterproductive.

Sacha Houlie, a member of President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist liberal La Republique En Marche party, warned that prohibiting university students and accompanying parents from public services and school trips, and preventing their participation in cultural and sporting activities would ""be totally counterproductive in relation to the very objective of this text which fought against the separatists"" and ""would refer these people to their identity"" so ""would favor the community withdrawal.""

Boris Vallaud, a member of the Socialist Party also reacted: “Students are users of the public service, this secularism does not apply to them.""

“To ban the veil at the university would be to say that all women who wear the veil pose a problem, which would mean we consider that it is Islam which poses a problem,"" said Pierre Yves Bournazel, an Act Together party member representing Paris.

A 2004 law prohibits the wearing or open display of religious symbols in all French schools, but it does not apply to universities. There is no law banning mothers from wearing the hijab on school trips, but there have been several instances when veiled women were verbally abused or asked to not accompany their wards.

The discussion was ignited by right wing and conservative Republican party member Eric Ciotti’s demand on Tuesday to ban the Islamic veil at the university. “We cannot tolerate that the university, temple of the knowledge of reason and science, can tolerate a garment of enslavement of the woman within it,’’ he told the hearing by the special commission examining the text of the bill “confirming respect for the principles of the Republic” at the National Assembly.

The government says the bill presented to the Council of Ministers on Dec. 9 aims to fight “separatism” and radicalization by a series of provisions such as banning polygamy or forced marriages, virginity certificates, homeschooling, controlling foreign funding, making places of worship more transparent, proscribing political meetings in a religious building, fighting against online hate speech and illegal content, among others.

Around 1,700 amendments were presented for discussion ahead of the examination of the bill which began on Monday, majority of which were labelled as “inadmissible”. This included an amendment by Aurore Berge and Jean-Baptiste Moreau, members of Macron’s party, to ban the wearing of the veil for ""little girls"" and mothers accompanying school trips, which was eventually rejected.

In a comment to the French daily Le Express, Berge said she stood by her suggestion, adding: “Supporting the improvement of access to abortion and fighting against the veiling of young girls are part of the same fight for the emancipation of women. You cannot be a variable-geometry feminist, or only be one when the battle is on.""

Earlier, Macron had warned over such amendments that there was a probable “danger to divert the debate on this question which has no place today” and it had ""no relation with the bill”.

“And this can lead to a stigmatization of Muslims, while we have repeatedly said it was not a text against the Muslim religion,” the daily Le Parisien quoted him as saying at a seminar last week.",[],"Boris Vallaud, a member of the Socialist Party also reacted: “Students are users of the public service, this secularism does not apply to them.""

Dhaka - A Bangladesh court sentenced five men to death Thursday for the 2012 gang-rape of a 15-year-old girl, amid growing public anger over rampant sexual violence.

The sentence was handed down in the northern district of Tangailby a special tribunal set up to deal with cases of abuse against women and children.

Prosecutor Nasim Ahmed said the victim’s boyfriend took her to a riverside where she was raped by him and two friends. Two others helped them.

“All five were found guilty and have been sentenced to death,” Ahmed told AFP. It was the first conviction since the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina this week introduced the death penalty for rape. Gang-rape already carried the death sentence, but rape by a single offender had previously been punishable only by life imprisonmen

Last week demonstrations broke out across the country after harrowing footage of a group of men stripping and attacking a woman went viral on social media.

National anger over the issue has been simmering since last month, when members of the ruling party’s student wing were arrested and charged in a separate gang rape case.

Protesters in the capital and elsewhere have demanded stiffer punishments, faster trials and an end to what they see as a culture of impunity for sex crimes.

Only around three percent of rape cases end in convictions.

At least 208 cases of gang-rape were reported in the first nine months of this year, according to Ain o Salish Kendra, a local rights group.

Bangladesh has hanged 23 people since 2013, while at least another 1,718 are on death row.

Rights activists have criticised the introduction of the death sentence for rape saying it will not reduce violence against women.

Karachi - Growing tendency of violence against women shows ill-mentality of our society. The freedom of society is linked to the freedom of women, said the speakers of a gathering, organised by the Home Based Women Workers Federation (HBWWF) in New Karachi on the occasion of international day against violence against women.

HBWWF general secretary Zehra Akbar Khan, speaking on the occasion, said that women could be accepted as complete human being only by ending all norms of patriarchy: social, political and economic.

She said this day of was designated as the international day against violence on women in 1999 by the general assembly of the UN. This day is being observed in the memory of three revolutionary real sisters, Patria, Minerva and Maria Tresa, who waged a struggle against dictator of Dominica Rafael Trujillo (1930-61) who was notorious for sexual harassment. The Mirabal Sisters and their husbands were subjected to torture and arrest but they did not budge and gave sacrifice of their lives, which resulted in the freedom of their country. These three sisters were later recognised as the icons of women rights and remembered as unforgettable butterflies.

She said that women in whole world were fighting for their rights and against all sorts of discriminatory treatment against them. She said; however, violence on women had become the part of daily life in whole world. She regretted that in this modern era the access of women to healthcare facilities was negligible. Every day more than 800 women die daily due to child-birth related complications, 95 percent of them in developing countries. Presently 836 million people live beneath the poverty line in the world and these people are deprived of their basic rights. Today there is big difference in wages of male and female workers. Every year 700 million girls are married before attaining 18 years of age and of them 250 million girls are married off before they reach the age of 15 years.

She said sexual harassment was the basis of male-dominated system to compel women accepting a forced inferiority. She said the roots of this system were deep in personal possession of the means of production. She said dictatorial behaviors, violence against the weaker segments of society, uneven distribution of wealth and disrespecting women were the hallmarks of this system.

It is high time that women should challenge the structure of this oppression based society and its mindset, which does not consider the women as a human being, she said. The real change is possible only if women become organised and adopt principles of communism and take part in democratic movements; for this it is necessary that they should study and raise their awareness which would lead them to bring a real change and gender equality, she maintained. She said when women decided to struggle for their rights, no one could deter them from achieving their targets. She urged the women to raise a loud and clear voice for their rights.",['Our Staff Reporter'],"Share:Karachi - Growing tendency of violence against women shows ill-mentality of our society.

FAISALABAD/LAYYAH - A minor girl was allegedly killed after rape in the area of Millat Town police station in Faisalabad, while Regional Police Officer (RPO) Riffat Mukhtar Raja took notice of the incident and directed the City Police Officer (CPO) Faisalabad to submit its report at the earliest.

A police spokesman said on Sunday that 4-year-old girl Meerab, daughter of a brick-kiln worker Faqeer Hussain, went missing while playing outside her house in Chak No 201-RB Chandian Talawan after Asar prayers. Her parents searched for her and found her body lying in a blood pool outside the locality late in the night.

They reported the matter to the police who took the body into custody and dispatched it to mortuary for postmortem. According to initial investigation, the girl was raped after abduction and then the accused killed her due to fear of arrest, the spokesman said.

In another incident, a newly-wed woman was killed by her in-laws for dowry in Layyah’s Chowk Azam, the police said on Sunday. According to the investigating officer, the woman married the suspect, identified as Azam, a month back. “Azam’s family demanded a car in dowry but we refused,” her brother said.

On Saturday, the culprit strangled my sister to death, he added. The body had been moved to a hospital for a post-mortem examination. An FIR had been registered.

Rawalpindi - Officials of Police Station Karachi Company have obtained three-day physical remand of a senior leader of PPP in a rape case, sources informed yesterday.

Nasir Abbas Khan Bangu, PPP Rawalpindi Division Vice President and former candidate of PP-3 Fateh Jhang, was arrested in connection with the rape of a woman namely Saima Pervin and was produced before the court of Civil Judge/Area Magistrate Aman Malik by the Karachi Company police led by Sub Inspector (SI) Zameer Ul Hassan.

The police investigators told the court that Nasir Khan Bangu is involved in assaulting a woman sexually on gunpoint at an unknown location where the victim was brought by his accomplices by luring her for a job. The police added a rape case number 384/20 under sections 376/109/34 was registered against Bangu and his gang on the complaint of the victim and the investigators wanted to recover the weapon and arrest the gang members by grilling the main culprit.

The police sought five-day physical remand of the accused but the judge rejected the plea and granted only three-day physical remand. SI Zameer Ul Hassan, while talking to The Nation, confirmed that the court had granted the police three-day physical custody of the alleged rapist. He said police are carrying raids to arrest other accomplices of the accused. According to a monitoring report, the Islamabad High Court meanwhile suspended the judge who had opened fire at the husband of PTI MPA, says a notification issued by the court registrar.

KARACHI - Pakistan Peoples Party MPA Sharmila Farooqui said on Sunday that nation would make real socio-economic progress when women are provided all equal rights at par with men across the country as the status of women in Pakistan differ considerably across classes, regions and the rural-urban divide and tribal and feudal social formations.

“Pakistan’s women want to pass life free from stigma, torture, harrassement and violence and need a future that’s sustainable, peaceful, with equal rights and opportunities for all. To get us there, the country needs women at every table where decisions are being made. Real national progress will come after women provided all rights,” she said in a statement on the occasion of the International Women’s Day being observed on March 8.

She paid tributes to Mohtarrma Benazir Bhutto and Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah for playing role to empower women and boosting demcracy in Pakistan.

“This year, UN Women has announced the theme for International Women’s Day 2021 as ‘Women in leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 world.’ The theme celebrated the tremendous efforts by women and girls around the world in shaping a more equal future and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Women from medical professional also took active part as frontline soldiers in fight against coronavirus in Pakistan,” she said. Sharmila said women in Pakistan made up 48.76 percent of the population and had played an important role in the country’s history. In Pakistan, women had held high offices including that of the Prime Minister, Speaker of the National Assembly, Leader of the Opposition, as well as federal ministers. However, there was need to further empower them, she added.

“Women in Pakistan face discrimination as result of patriarchal society of Pakistan. Some of the problem faced by women in the country are domestic violence, honour killing, rape and abduction, marital rape, and forced marriages, which needs to be ended by implementing all existing laws,” she said.

Reffering to reports, she said that the Global Gender Gap Index report 2020 ranked Pakistan 151 out of the total 153 countries. Another survey ranked Pakistan as sixth most dangerous country for women. She asked the federal and all other provincial governments to implement all laws pertaining to women rights, so that they could also progress at par with men in the society. Sharmila said Islam not only gives basic equality to woman, but also equal legal rights. The woman may buy, sell, earn a living and manage her own money and property as per the Islamic laws.

She said there had been several laws for protection of the women, however, there was need to implement them in letter and spirit. She informed that women’s full and effective participation and leadership in all areas of life drives progress for everyone. Women were also at the forefront of the battle against COVID-19, as front-line and health sector workers, as scientists, doctors and caregivers, yet they get paid 11 percent less globally than their male counterparts. An analysis of COVID-19 task teams from 87 countries found only 3.5 percent of them had gender parity.

The reported gang rape of a 19-year-old lower caste woman in the Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh has shaken the entire nation, and several politicians are seeking to visit the victim's family.

A man hurled ink at Delhi parliamentarian Sanjay Singh while he was addressing the media after meeting the family of an alleged gang-rape victim who is said to have been brutally assaulted by four upper caste men on 14 September.

The video of the incident has gone viral with over 45,000 views. It shows a man walking up to a group of media personnel surrounding the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and hurling ink at him.

The man, identified as Deepak Sharma, has been detained by police. He said the lawmaker's visit to Hathras was politically motivated, which made him throw ink at him.

Soon after being attacked, Singh tweeted that Uttar Pradesh State Chief Yogi Adityanath ""is not a Thakur (Upper caste community) but a coward and that he (Singh) would continue to fight for justice for the little girl"".

The four accused in the gang-rape of the Dalit (lower caste community) girl, also belong to the upper caste Thakur community.

The state chief, who has been under fire from opposition parties for his ""inefficient and insensitive"" handling of the case, has ordered a probe by India's top investigation agency Central Bureau of Investigation into the incident.

After being moved to Delhi's Safdarjung hospital for better treatment, the young woman died from her injuries on 29 September.

PESHAWAR - Police in northwest Pakistan have made a string of arrests as they search for the killer of a two-year-old girl whose rape and murder have drawn comparisons to an infamous 2018 killing that sparked riots.

The girl, Zainab, disappeared Tuesday while playing outside her village home in Charsadda district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Her body was discovered a day later, prompting a large-scale manhunt that by Saturday had led to the arrests of at least 17 men, district police chief Muhammad Shoaib told a foreign news agency. Additionally, police took DNA samples from about 400 people, he said.

""Initial medical reports have confirmed the minor girl was raped before murder,"" Shoaib said. The incident was reminiscent of an early 2018 case in which a six-year old girl -- also called Zainab -- was raped and murdered in the eastern city of Kasur, in Punjab province.

The killing sparked outrage across Pakistan, with violence erupting in Kasur as thousands swarmed police stations and set fire to politicians' homes, while Pakistanis across the country took to social media demanding action. Her killer was hanged later that year. This week's case has led to growing outrage on social media, with #JusticeforZainab and #AnotherZainab circulating widely on Pakistani Twitter.

Meanwhile, one of the suspects arrested for raping and murdering the 2.year-old girl in Charsadda has confessed to the crime, police sources confirmed on Saturday. According to the sources, the suspect is presently in police custody and had 'confessed' to the crime during interrogation.

Police said they interrogated more than 300 people in the case, after which all but 15 suspects were released. One of those 15 suspects has now allegedly confessed to the crime. Police further revealed that a murder weapon was also recovered from the suspect and that the crime scene location was identified.

Upon the identification of the accused, the police also recovered the girl's shoes from the fields. According to the police, the suspect said that he had abducted the girl from Sheikh Kali and murdered her after raping her. The police further said that the accused is 40-years-old and belongs to the same village as the girl.

The child was abducted in Charsadda on October 6 and was killed after being raped. Her body had been recovered from a field the next day.",['News Desk'],"The girl, Zainab, disappeared Tuesday while playing outside her village home in Charsadda district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

KARACHI - Sindh Minister for Women Development Syeda Shehla Raza said here on Thursday that the helpline 1094 was functional round the clock to receive complaints from women. Addressing a function, organised by the Department of Women Development in collaboration with Pathfinder for the promotion of “Gender-Based Violence Helpline 1094”, she urged the media to create awareness in people about the issues women are facing these days.

She further said that the Sindh government had enacted several laws to ensure protection of women’s rights, adding these laws had also been appreciated globally.

Syeda Shehla Raza said that under the Constitution, there should be 10 percent representation of women in the police department, but unfortunately a very few women were in the Force these days. “In this regard, women need to be encouraged,” she stressed. The provincial minister further said that her ministry was in touch with various mobile services to provide more information to the people about 1094 through SMS. Shehla said that since there was still room for further improvement in the legal aid system, eminent lawyers had been hired by the Women Complaint Centers for the purpose.

She said that women were playing a key role in the development of Pakistan. “The role of women in judiciary, lawmaking and administration is commendable,” she said, and added, “Women in Pakistan have all the opportunities to excel in different spheres of life.”

She further said that the Sindh government had launched several programmes under the Women Development Department to encourage skilled women, which, she said, was making it easier for them to access the markets.

“In addition, the department is working day and night to provide legal assistance to women suffering from domestic violence, workplace harassment and other issues,” Shehla said, and added, “In addition, Women Development Department is also taking steps to make women economically empowered through provision of jobs.”

Responding to questions from media persons, the provincial minister said that it had been observed in cases of forced marriages that most of the affected women gave statements in court in the favour of their husbands.

Responding to a question on child marriages, she said that in such cases, the victim was kept in Darul Aman till she became an adult with the permission of the court.

The Sindh minister said that women’s rights were very clearly laid down in the holy Quran and Hadith. “Women are treated with respect in an Islamic society as relationships of mother, sister and wife are considered sacred here,” she elaborated.

ISLAMABAD - EU Ambassador to Pakistan Androulla Kaminara Sunday said the European Union fully backed Pakistan’s efforts to overcome the socioeconomic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and build back better for a more sustainable future.

“The COVID-19 has shaken the world unexpectedly – and we will continue to feel the socioeconomic consequences of the virus for quite a long-time. Showing solidarity with each other during the trying times is the responsibility of all of us,” she said in an exclusive interview with APP.

She said it was an unprecedented challenge, but Pakistan had so far managed the crisis very well. “The data from the WHO (World Health Organization), which I have followed closely over the past few months, suggests that COVID-19 cases and deaths are on a steep decline in Pakistan. At the peak of the daily infections in mid-June there were over 6,000 new infections per day and for most of August this has been reduced to about 500 new infections or lower per day.”

It was heartening that the Pakistan government’s measures such as smart lockdowns as well as testing and tracing had helped slow down the spread of virus considerably, Androulla Kaminara remarked.

The government, she said, had taken a number of positive initiatives to stimulate the economy during the difficult time and also to help those segments of the population, which had been particularly affected by the pandemic. One example was the expansion of the Ehsaas Programme to cover approximately 23 million households, she added.

Says fully backs Pakistan’s efforts to overcome socioeconomic impacts of coronavirus pandemic

As regards the Pak-EU relations, Ambassador Kaminara said the European Union had been an honest and longstanding partner and friend to Pakistan. “We have had formal relations for nearly the past six decades and cooperation in a number of areas during that time.”

The EU-Pakistan bilateral relations received a major boost when the Strategic Engagement Plan (SEP) was signed in June 2019, to further enhance engagement between the two sides, and address emerging global challenges, she added.

Giving details of the SEP projects, she said it included the traditional areas of cooperation such as peace and security, democracy, rule of law, good governance, human rights, migration and mobility, trade and investment. The SEP had also introduced cooperation in additional increasingly important areas such as energy, climate change, connectivity, education and culture, and science and technology. Trade, the envoy, said was one of the cornerstones of the EU’s relationship with Pakistan as the EU supported the latter’s integration into the world economy and its sustainable economic development.

“The EU is the biggest export market for Pakistani goods. We account for about one-third of all Pakistani exports, with the second destination accounting for about half of this.”

Pakistan’s export volume, she said, increased from € 4.5 billion in 2014 when GSP+ was awarded to the country, to € 7.5 billion in 2019, which reflected a handsome 66.6% increase. Between 2018 and 2019, there was an increase of 9% in the exports to Europe, which was also quite substantial.

She said Pakistan could do even better to utilise GSP+ to diversify its export base. The EU was now focusing on value addition and exploring new export potential for instance processed food and beverages, which would provide a boost to the agriculture sector.

“So overall, definitely the EU-Pak relations have been progressively getting stronger and also expanding in new areas,” she remarked.

To a query about the EU-supported projects in Pakistan, Ambassador Kaminara said Pakistan was one of the EU’s major development partners, with one of the largest programmes of aid in Asia.

EU-Pakistan cooperation priorities for 2014-20 programme period focused on rural development (50%), education and vocational training (35%) and good governance, rule of law and human rights.

Recently, the envoy said, the EU development funding was allocated in seven-year cycles. “Discussions for priority areas for the 2021-2027 period are just starting with relevant stakeholders (in Pakistan), which include of course the federal government, provincial government as well as non-state actors.”

She said, “Currently our focus is also to support Pakistan in its fight against COVID-19 and to address the social and economic impact of the pandemic – with a particular focus on women and vulnerable groups.”",[],"“The COVID-19 has shaken the world unexpectedly – and we will continue to feel the socioeconomic consequences of the virus for quite a long-time.

Rawalpindi - A drunken man in Jhanda Cheechi allegedly killed a nine-year-old girl after sexually assaulting while sparking unrest and agitation in the area, informed sources on Tuesday.

The deceased girl was a student of class 3 and daughter of a car washer, they said.

The incident took place in the limits of Police Station (PS) Civil Lines and the rapist-cum-killer identified as Baber Masih was arrested by police, sources said.

An FIR, registered with police, revealed that the accused man, who works as a private sanitary worker in the area, was helped by his wife Aniqa in brutalising the nine-year-old girl.

An investigation revealed that the girl was gang-raped before she was murdered. Allegedly, Babar Masih tortured the girl to death after raping her, said an investigator.

According to contents of FIR, a copy of which was available with The Nation, the father of victim girl told police he has one son and three daughters and washes cars in Katcheri to earn livelihood. He added some guests arrived at his home on March 22 and he sent his daughter to nearby shop for buying edibles for guests but she did not return home. He added a search by family revealed that Aniqa took the girl to her home which later was locked. “We found shoe of our daughter in front of her bedroom,” the complainant said adding that torture marks were found on body of his daughter. He appealed police to register case against Aniqa and her unknown accomplices and to arrest them.

Police registered case and arrest Babar, the husband of Aniqa, sources said.

Meanwhile, the family and area people poured on road and surrounded police station Civil Lines. Blocking road for traffic, the mob attempted to storm into police station while chanting slogans, “Give us custody of rapist and we will hang him publicly.”

SSP Potohar Division Syed Ali, when contacted by The Nation, confirmed the incident. He said police held the accused and started investigation. He said police took samples from body of the girl and sent to laboratory for forensic. He said police also collected some more evidences from the crime scene.

A heavy contingent of police rushed to the scene and negotiated with the protestors. The protestors dispersed peacefully after top command of Rawalpindi police assured them that the accused would be brought to justice as per law.

Funeral prayer of the girl was offered at Jhanda Cheechi and buried in a nearby graveyard.

Meanwhile, Inspector General of Police (IGP) Inam Ghani took notice of the inhuman incident and sought report from RPO Rawalpindi Region Imran Ahmer in this regard.

ISLAMABAD - Federal Minister for Human Rights Dr Shireen Mazari on Thursday said new anti-rape law will institute greater protection for women and children in the country.

She said this in an event held here in collaboration with UN Women at the Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Centre for Women to commemorate Human Rights Day and mark the end to 16 days of activism campaign against gender-based violence. The theme for the event was “Strengthening Access to Justice for Survivors.”

Notably, the event featured the inauguration of a new computer lab at the Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Centre for Women by Minister for Human Rights, Dr Shireen Mazari. Speaking at the event, the minister emphasised the three areas of focus of the Ministry of Human Rights i.e. on overcoming gaps in legislation, strengthening implementation, and increasing awareness about human rights.

Dr Mazari emphasised the importance of increasing reporting on the Ministry’s 1099 human rights helpline and application. She also spoke about the new Anti-Rape (Investigation & Trial) Ordinance 2020, which institutes an expansion of the definition of rape; harsher punishments for sex offenders; the establishment of special courts and anti-rape crisis cells, additional protections for victims and witnesses, as well as importantly, the prohibition of the use of the two finger test, in order to institute greater protection for women and children in Pakistan.

One of the survivors residing at the shelter also addressed the audience at the event. She spoke about the significance of increasing communication and awareness about laws and facilities available to survivors of gender based violence, as well as increasing opportunities for vocational training as well as psychological counselling.

The event also marked the end of the Ministry of Human Rights’16 Days of Activism Campaign on women’s fundamental rights. The campaign was geared towards raising awareness about women’s rights through a series of short informational videos that cover important topics including sexual harassment, rape, the marriage contract, filing an FIR and women’s inheritance.

SUKKUR - ATC Kandhkot remanded Khairullah Bugti to seven-day police custody for allegedly raping a mother and her minor daughter.

According to Kashmore Police, Malik and Khairullah Bugti enticed Tabassum to a job opportunity at Kashmore Toll Plaza and subsequently raped her and her four-year-old daughter Alisha. The condition of the child, admitted to local hospital of Karachi, was stated to be serious. Kandhkot Police on Thursday produced accused Khairullah Bugti at ATC Court Kandhkot for his involvement in the brutal rape. The police had sought 14-day remand but the ATC judge handed him over to police for seven days.

DSP Muhammed Panah Bhutto, head of the Joint Investigation team, said that a probe was underway and after scrutinizing the statement of the accused, victims and the evidence, he would submit the JIT report to SSP Kambher-Shahdadkot.

Child victim of severe abuse, reflects considerable improvement, says NICH chief

Alisha, the four year girl child subjected to gang rape at Kashmore and transported to Karachi on Novemeber 14, in an extremely severe condition, is showing improvement, said Prof. Jamal Raza, Executive Director, National Institute of Child Health (NICH) here on Thursday. Briefing the media the NICH chief said condition of the child was getting better and the severe infection caused due to injuries had also been adequately treated through proper management.

“We are planning to take out the tubes today and subsequently start feeding,” said Prof. Jamal mentioning that a combined team of medical specialists would assess the child Friday and decide further interventions required for her progress in the coming days.

Alisha, who was initially treated at Larkana, where she also underwent a surgery, had to be shifted to NICH due to her deteriorating condition. The child subjected to brutal abuse causing severe abdominal wounds and also varied categories of injuries needed urgent measures that could help control associated infections.

A board of medical experts comprising Prof. Haleema (gynecologist) and pediatric surgeons Prof. Nasir and Dr. Naima thoroughly examined her under general Anaesthesia, following which it was decided to clean her abdominal cavity. The wound was closed after deflating the gut, said Dr. Raza reminding that she was, as per advise of the experts, put on antibiotics and placed at intensive care unit as the child suffered from complications with oozing from abdominal wounds and opening up of sutures.",['Our Staff Reporter'],"Share:SUKKUR - ATC Kandhkot remanded Khairullah Bugti to seven-day police custody for allegedly raping a mother and her minor daughter.

Baghdad- More morphine!” Malak’s mother cried, her 20-year-old daughter hospitalised after a marital dispute left her severely burned -- the latest victim of domestic violence exacerbated by confinement in Iraq. The nationwide lockdown since mid-March is meant to keep coronavirus cases down in the country, but it has led to a spike in another sad statistic: domestic violence. The head of Iraq’s community police, Brigadier General Ghalib Atiyah, told AFP that its log of domestic violence cases has increased by an average of 30 percent since the curfew came into force -- with some areas seeing as high as a 50-percent spike. In a single week, the United Nations in Iraq (UNAMI) reported: “The rape of a woman with special needs, spousal abuse, immolation and self-immolation as well as self-inflicted injuries due to spousal abuse, sexual harassment of minors, and suicide due to domestic abuse among other crimes.” In the southern province of Wasit, a 58-year-old doctor killed his wife after she refused to let him sell land that she owned, according to human rights lawyer Sajjad Hussein. To the north in Samarra, footage surfaced of a 10-year-old girl in tears, her arms apparently broken. “I don’t want to see my dad any more, he hits me every day,” says the child, identified as Saba. “He tells us it’s to ‘educate us,’” her mother, who is divorced, is heard saying. But Malak al-Zubeidi’s case made waves. Eight months ago, the young woman in the shrine city of Najaf married a policeman who physically abused her and barred her from seeing her family, Malak’s mother told Human Rights Watch (HRW). On April 8, he beat Malak so badly she doused herself in gasoline and set herself on fire, her mother said, burning for several minutes before her father-in-law put out the flames.

- Afraid to seek help -

Footage of her swollen, burned face and pained wails in the hospital went viral, but public support could not save her: the young woman died 10 days later. “All Malak wanted was to be able to see her family,” said Hana Edwar, a longtime women’s rights advocate in Baghdad. Her NGO, Amal (hope in Arabic), has documented a “dramatic” rise in domestic violence cases during the curfew, she told AFP. “Everyone is spending long periods of time together inside the house. The most insignificant thing can turn into a controversy that eventually leads to violence,” she said.

Extended families often live together in one household in Iraq, swathes of which still hold on to conservative religious and tribal customs.

In those areas, many girls are married at a young age and subject to domestic violence.

According to the UN, 46 percent of married women in Iraq have survived some form of abuse at home, of which a third report physical and sexual assault.

They have few pathways to seek help.

A recent survey by the International Organisation for Migration found that 85 percent of men in Iraq would bar female relatives from filing a police report.

And 75 percent of female respondents admitted they would not feel comfortable reporting to the police, likely fearing possible additional abuse and the cultural stigma in Iraq surrounding women entering stations alone.

The community police has work to do to erase that taboo but cannot reach out to communities through its usual town halls because of the curfew, Atiyah told AFP.

- ‘Total impasse’ -

There are also few shelters available for victims and legal accountability seems far-fetched.

Article 41 of Iraq’s penal code gives men the right to “punish” their wives and children “within the limits of law and customs”, a clause frequently used to dismiss cases brought against relatives.

Many abuse cases are “resolved” in tribal courts, which have their own legal framework that includes settlements to aggrieved families outside of official tribunals.

And “honour killings”, or violence meted out extrajudicially against someone who broke a social norm, are usually met with light sentences by Iraqi courts.

After the public outcry over Malak, three of her male relatives were slapped with six-month jail sentences for “failing to assist someone in danger”.

Activists have long pushed Iraq’s parliament to adopt a more robust domestic violence law that would better protect victims and deter possible abusers.

“Every time, MPs bring up religion’s role or pretend they’re worried such cases would clog the courts,” said advocate Afrah al-Qaisi.

“It’s a total impasse,” she told AFP.

Now, the UN and HRW have seized on the wave of abuse under lockdown to point a spotlight at the issue.

Iraq’s parliament should quickly revise, pass and enforce a domestic violence law in line with international standards, the New York-based HRW said.

“It should not take a global pandemic for Iraqi legislators to address the other deadly pandemic of domestic violence, but failure to do so will cost more lives,” HRW’s Belkis Wille said.",[],"Her NGO, Amal (hope in Arabic), has documented a “dramatic” rise in domestic violence cases during the curfew, she told AFP.

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has released new guidelines for Muslims in the country with the aim of prohibiting dowries and extravagant marriages after a woman recently committed suicide due to “dowry harassment.”

The guidelines are contained in a document released for Muslims to be signed and followed. The AIMPLB is widely regarded in India as the representative of Muslims in the country.

The 11-point guidelines were released by AIMPLB Chairman Maulana Rabe Hasan Nadvi recently.

Nadvi has urged all members of the Muslim community to shun the dowry system and lavish spending during wedding ceremonies.

The move comes after a Muslim girl from Gujarat committed suicide last month by drowning herself over dowry harassment, in which her husband and in-laws physically abused her for the dowry. The suicide set off a countrywide debate over social evils associated with marriage among Muslims.

The board has already launched a 10-day drive to educate members of the community across the country and to raise awareness against such evils. During the campaign, Muslim clerics will place emphasis on solemnizing marriages according to Islamic customs to eradicate dowries and overspending during marriage functions.

The new guidelines allow only simple wedding ceremonies, ban dowries and do not permit traditions such as wedding processions, fireworks, dancing and lavish feasts, as it calls them un-Islamic. It only allows Dawat-e-Walima, a feast served after wedding rituals are completed by the groom’s family in which invitations are also extended to poor and needy people of the community.

Many un-Islamic rituals have ended

Maulana Umrain Mahfooz Rahmani, secretary of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said it is not right to say that measures to end social evils like dowries are being taken suddenly.

“The Muslim Personal Law Board has been working for years to bring about good changes in society and motivates Muslims to end bad practices and customs. As far as marriage is concerned, work has been done on it for years so that the evil practices that have become associated with it could be curbed,” he told Anadolu Agency.

Previously, marriages were rarely solemnized in mosques. But now a good change is taking place and a large number of marriages are being performed in mosques and many un-Islamic rituals have ended, said Rahmani.

He said that despite many good changes, the painful aspect is that many poor girls still stay unmarried as their families are unable to spend a lot of money.

“There are many others who are suffering even after marriage as the dowry demand continues and the girl’s husband and his family keep pressuring her to bring more dowries. Many girls commit suicide as they are unable to bear the physical and mental harassment. To end all these things, a new guideline has been made and it is being worked on all over the country.

“Members of the Personal Law Board are in the entire country. Among them are well-known Muslims from a cross section of Indian Muslim society such as religious leaders, lawyers, politicians, scholars and other professionals. They have been asked to work on this in their respective areas. Meetings of imams [clerics] of mosques are being held all over the country,” he added.

Similarly, members of the Islah E Muasharah (Reforms of Society) Committee of the board have also been asked to discuss this issue and take action so that more and more people can be made aware. In most areas of the country, discussions are taking place and the common people are participating in debates.

“Even in the mosques, the clerics are talking with the people. During the last three Fridays, discussions and arguments took place in the mosques after the Friday prayers and the harms of the dowry system and mega wedding ceremonies were explained to the people. People visiting the mosques for offering namaz [prayers] are being told to avoid dowries and extravagance,” said Rahmani.

Zafaryab Jilani, a member of the Muslim Personal Law Board, said marriage is a contract.

“Our effort is to make nikah [marriage] easy and simple for the people.”

“We want them to avoid spending money unnecessarily in marriage so that they can present a good example before society. The board has always tried this and will continue to do so,” said Jilani.",[],"Nadvi has urged all members of the Muslim community to shun the dowry system and lavish spending during wedding ceremonies.

A 3 percent conviction rate in crimes related to Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) is evidence that violence against women and girls continues to run rampant in Pakistan despite consistent and extensive law reform on various types of crimes against women, children and other vulnerable groups. Among the many issues that plague the country, gender disparity in all sections of society (as evidenced by World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Parity Index where Pakistan ranks 151 out of 153 country) is a result of the violence, discrimination and injustice to which women and girls are subjected daily.

Progressive legislation and the commitment to establish better mechanisms has improved the criminal justice system’s response to Gender-Based Violence (GBV) to an extent. A reformist spirit espoused by the judiciary, parliament and civil society organisations resulted in laws such as the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Offences Relating to Rape) Act, 2016 and the Sindh Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection Act), 2013 which have paved the way for a stronger commitment to fight GBV and enhance legal protections afforded to victims of such crimes. However, the challenge still lies in implementation of these laws due to lack of effective mechanisms, infrastructure and institutional non-commitment to implement the letter and spirit of such legislation. Thus, the conviction rates especially in cases of rape (including male rape), child abuse and domestic violence have not increased, rather attrition levels have augmented.

A Sindh-focused study conducted by the Legal Aid Society on Gaps in Investigation and Prosecution of Rape and Sodomy cases provides a snapshot of the timelines involved in such cases in Sindh after a 3-month time limit for rape trials was prescribed by the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Offences Relating to Rape) Act 2016. It is important to note that the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 also provides 14 days for investigation, with special permission to be granted for investigation taking longer. The Gap Analysis shows that on average, it takes about 14 months for rape and sodomy cases to be decided, calculated from the date of FIR to date of final order. Though the investigation phase takes up 1.5 months of total time, the report observes that the trial phase takes up more than 9 months which is three times the stipulated duration as per the 2016 law. A qualitative assessment of the cases also revealed how gender bias and societal norms influence the decisions taken by the criminal justice system which further add to the problems faced by litigants. Lack of gender-neutral language in judgment writing, lack of understanding of medical evidence and great reliance on rape myths creates an environment which is opposed to a victim-centric approach to prosecuting GBV. The report further states that attrition levels remain high due to victims and witnesses resiling and entering into out-of-court compromises. In about 52 percent cases studied, victims and prosecution witnesses resiled which led to acquittals.

It is also observed that victim/witness resiling is also a consequence of the traumatising experiences they go through while struggling to obtain justice. Another study conducted by the Legal Aid Society studies Court User Satisfaction to gauge the experience of victims of GBV and to gain an understanding of the factors that contribute to low confidence in the criminal justice system’s ability to deliver expeditious justice. Evidence from the survey conducted in Karachi and Hyderabad GBV Courts shows that absence of special protection measures contribute to low perceptions of safety by women as compared to men. Victims of GBV also reflected that long drawn legal battles negatively impacted their experience with the court and in many situations coerce them to enter into compromises with the accused.

Evidencing the data from research conducted on GBV cases and courts shows how litigants suffer in their struggle to obtain justice. Victims of rape and sodomy particularly go through re-traumatisation due to delays in justice, lack of protection measures and insensitive questioning and treatment during trial. In such a hostile environment, owing to long case proceedings and due to external pressures and intimidation victims/complainants of GBV are forced to compromise. This significantly hampers any successes gained at the legislative front.

Recognising the current gaps in the judicial system, in November 2019 the National Judicial Policy Making Committee (NJPMC) directed all provincial High Courts to establish special Gender Based Violence Courts in an effort to provide speedy justice to victims of SGBV on a priority basis and in a gender-sensitive manner. Section 3 of the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Ordinance, 2020 has also promulgated the establishment of Special Courts for GBV, signalling towards the prioritisation SGBV crimes require and has provided a legal cover to these existing courts.

The operationalisation of special procedures such as GBV courts are aimed at alleviating the challenges and problems victims face in an effort to obtain justice. These challenges represent not only legal problems, but also the social, structural and systemic issues that women and girls confront daily. A victim of rape or child abuse while facing societal pressures to compromise also has to go through severe episodes of re-traumatisation and victimisation during trial. Constant intimidation by the accused, in addition to inappropriate questioning by defence counsel at trial and the social stigma and shame attached to such a horrific crime coerces victims/survivors into compromising or resiling.

GBV courts essentially work towards eliminating the challenges faced by such victims and survivors. These courts operate with the objective to reduce trial time; to create a safe space and environment for victims and survivors through implementation of special protection measures; improving the experience of victims/survivors with the CJS through adoption of victim-centric approach and elimination of insensitive treatment and adoption of a coordinated and integrated approach among various CJS actors to work towards increasing conviction rates to deter GBV crimes. The promulgation of establishing GBV courts is inspired by their success in other jurisdictions and reinforced by the success of the GBV court established in Lahore. In many countries such as South Africa, UK, New Zealand and India, the success of special courts for GBV has been manifold. In addition to easing access to justice for victims and survivors, these courts have also enhanced deterrence to the incidence of such crimes by increasing conviction rates (65 percent of all tried cases in South Africa and 78 percent in Spain). Furthermore, these courts have also considerably built public confidence in state institutions’ ability to deliver justice through strict enforcement of special protection measures.

The GBV Courts are now operational across Pakistan. Lahore and Islamabad High Courts have created guidelines for the operation of these courts and for how judges should proceed in such cases. However, these have not yet been notified in Sindh, leaving a gap in the effective functioning of these courts, resulting in the absence of an operational framework under which they can operate. The User Satisfaction Survey and Assessment of GBV Courts conducted by LAS provide ample evidence that currently the 27 GBV Courts in Sindh have not implemented special protection measures and special procedures which reflect these courts’ special GBV charge. For the GBV Courts to have the kind of success seen in international jurisdictions, the State, the Supreme Court and High Courts must provide adequate technical and human resources to ensure their full operationalisation; this needs to be done by implementing special protection measures such as victim waiting rooms and video-link testimony facilities to name a few. All GBV Courts must be equipped with these facilities, as opposed to the ad hoc allocation to only a few courtrooms instead of all.

With SGBV related crimes rising exponentially across the country, it has become all the more imperative to fully operationalise special protection mechanisms and infrastructure provided by the Gender Based Violence Courts. Integrated approaches are also required to reduce trial times as laid down in the 2016 Rape Act. Ensuring that GBV courts function under a strong legal and operational framework will serve this purpose. Indeed, the full operationalisation of all GBV courts across the country can usher in a new era of addressing gender-based violence with greater rigor and strict enforcement of the law to secure greater conviction rates and increase deterrence towards sexual and gender-based violence crimes.

The National Assembly of Pakistan on Wednesday went orange to show solidarity with the global 16 Days of Activism campaign

against Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and officially launch it in Pakistan. In relevance to this day a special event was organized at Parliament House.

Speaker National Assembly, Mr. Asad Qaiser graced the event as the Chief Guest.

Secretary WPC Ms. Munaza Hassan gave the welcome remarks at the start of the event. Resident Coordinator United Nations in Pakistan, Mr. Julien Harneis addressed the event that was attended by parliamentarians, representatives of the government, UN agencies, civil society and media, both virtually and in-person at the National Assembly.

Addressing the event, Speaker National Assembly Asad Qaiser said: ""The Government is committed to end violence against women as a topmost priority.

It's time to recognize the role of women and take substantial steps for ensuring equal participation of women in legislation. Gender equality cannot be achieved without ending violence against women and girls. Women need to be encouraged and motivated and the incumbent government was committed for the protection of women's rights and providing them safe environment. In order to give women their due status, we also need to change the mindset and behavior. Joint efforts are needed to bring them into mainstream.""

While giving welcome remarks, Secretary Women's Parliamentary Caucus, Munaza Hassan said: ""The world is undergoing significant social, political, economic and environmental development, which leaves a deep mark on our people - especially women of every household. With Covid-19 resurgence, the world retreats inside homes due to lockdowns, making situation even worse

for women. Escalation in already existing pandemic of violence against women is quite visible. The Constitution of Pakistan negates any discrimination on the basis of gender. Its Articles 25(3) and 34 are the two most significant articles in favor of women. Article25 (3) states that nothing shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the protection of women. The Women's Parliamentary Caucus has been at the forefront of improving legislations for the rights of women and we will continue our efforts along with our trusted partners.""

Mr. Harneis appreciated the pledge taken by all participants during the event, and expressed the hope that each person would follow through on this pledge in their lives to prevent gender-based violence from happening in all public and private settings.

He also commended the WPC's role in promoting the agenda of women's rights and leadership in the country. While acknowledging that Pakistan has made great progress especially in the area of legislative and policy reform, the RC highlighted that there was a lot left to do for effective implementation of existing pro-women laws. ""The World Economic Forum places Pakistan at 151 out of 153 countries in its latest Global Gender Gap Report. But a positive sign is that women have around 24 percent representation in both houses of the Parliament, and women parliamentarians contributed 33 percent of the parliamentary business. With more women in power and decision-making, we can make great strides in advancing women's empowerment and gender equality and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls,"" he stated.

Women parliamentarians from several political parties as well as representatives from the government, UN agencies and civil society also participated in the event and pledged to put in efforts for ending violence against women and girls in Pakistan. They promised to play an active role in freeing the country from all forms of gender-based violence and discrimination and stand with and support survivors.

The event was jointly arranged by the Federal Women's Parliamentary Caucus (WPC) and UN Women Pakistan to kick off the 16 Days of Activism against GBV, a global campaign that takes place each year from 25th of November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, to 10th of December, International Human Rights Day, indicating that violence against

women is the most pervasive violation of human rights worldwide. The 16 Days campaign is used as an organizing strategy by individuals and organizations around the world to call for the prevention and elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls.

With the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, this year's theme for the 16 Days of Activism against GBV is ""Fund, Respond, Prevent, Collect!"" The theme calls for prioritizing support and funding to essential services for GBV prevention and response especially in the COVID-19 situation, supporting women's rights organizations working at the nexus of COVID-19 and GBV, declaring a national policy of zero tolerance for GBV with a concrete action plan, launching behavior change social mobilization campaigns, undertaking explicit measures to maintain services for survivors of GBV as essential during COVID-19 lockdowns, ensuring a continuum of adequate criminal justice response mechanisms, and collecting data with the aim to inform and improve GBV services and interventions.",[],"Share:The National Assembly of Pakistan on Wednesday went orange to show solidarity with the global 16 Days of Activism campaignagainst Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and officially launch it in Pakistan.

COVID-19 is causing many people to lose their jobs. PM Imran Khan has started the Ehsas Emergency Program to facilitate daily wagers who are out of jobs by providing 15,000 per month. But the money was only given for one month and was not continued forward.

Due to no preventive measures taken at the start to curb this pandemic, and now again the heavy burden of a new budget on the shoulders of the poor and daily wagers, many are deprived of a sufficient lifestyle. This has also raised the rate of domestic violence due to depression and other such cognitive issues resulting from COVID-19. It is globally reported that domestic violence has increased amid this lockdown.

The brutality against females has also risen. Recently, girls were killed by their brothers in the name of honour in Waziristan; these illiterate people deem women to be a curse. The government should introduce such programs to entertain daily workers. The government still has ample time in their hands to take the best measures to eradicate COVID-19 and bring positive schemes to facilitate poor people and eliminate domestic violence.

A government who is speaking about ‘State of madina’ is doing nothing except saving their positions and money.

I request prime minister to take actions against such molesters. Its enough now. If you cannot handle than you should allow us (women, children) to keep knives and blades in their bags or purses so they could handle their situations by themselves. As the graph of this society is declining day by day and government is unable to stop this. And this is the only option left. Kill the rapist at spot because there’s no mercy for such monsters.

Among the many issues aggravating the covid-19 pandemic has been the rise in violence against women reported the world over. Reports of domestic violence increased by 30% in France, over 50% in certain US states and tripling in China’s Hubei province, for instance.

In Pakistan, violence against women has been one of the goriest manifestations of human rights abuse. And as a result, the covid-19 lockdowns have seen its aggravation.

The so-called honour killings have persisted across the country, and even a global pandemic couldn’t cause a reduction. During the first month of the covid-19 lockdown in Pakistan, in Swat alone eight women lost their lives over ‘honour’.

According to the Barikot police, six of the women had been killed by their husbands, while two took their own lives. The police additionally reported attempted suicides as well, as they look to crack down on the culprits, and prevent further violence against women.

“The police took timely action… and filed report under the honour killing laws,” Barikot’s Deputy Superintendent of Police Badshah Hazrat said.

Multiple legislations, aiming to prevent honour killings, have been in place for decades. These include the 2006, Protection of Women Act of 2006, the Third Amendment to the Criminal Law Act from 2011, and the Punjab Protection of Women against Violence Act along with the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Offences in the name or pretext of Honour) Act passed in 2016. However, the implementation of these laws has been a concern.

Even bigger question mark has been over addressing the patriarchal setup of the society and the ideals that have historically been used to justify violence against women.

Among the many forms of violence justified through aggressive misogyny is domestic violence, which has seen a global rise in recent weeks. With families locked down, and no escape for many owing to the pandemic, the violence against female family members has increased.

Furthermore, with the global pandemic causing multiple crises, the impact of those has also translated into a rise in domestic violence – which often self-manifests in abusing the most vulnerable.

Mental health professionals and other medical practitioners, currently offering telehealth services in Pakistan, have reported that domestic abuse has significantly increased during the lockdown. Some health professionals have even reported that online health sessions are being cut short under intimidation or fear of a violent backlash. Not only women, but children have been bearing the brunt of the abuse during lockdowns as well.

Pakistan’s Human Rights Ministry has noted the vulnerability of women and children during the covid-19 crisis, and has set up a helpline to curtail the violence.

“Lockdowns and quarantine measures often leave women and children vulnerable to domestic abuse and violence — which is known to rise during emergencies. Our helpline is here to help you. Dial 1099 or call/text us on WhatsApp: 03339085709,” the official Twitter handle of the ministry posted.

Federal Human Rights Rabia Javeri Agha has further underlined that efforts are ongoing to protect women. She says that the ministry is looking to raise awareness with regards to the rights of women, and providing the victims the help that they needed.

“Women are more vulnerable to violence due to the current lockdown, as male family members target them due to frustration. We are evolving a comprehensive plan to counter domestic violence and create awareness among women [during the pandemic],” Agha said.",['Kk Shahid'],"Share:Among the many issues aggravating the covid-19 pandemic has been the rise in violence against women reported the world over.

Islamabad-Additional and Sessions Judge (ASJ) Islamabad (West) Muhammad Atta Rabbani on Wednesday rejected the bail plea of PPP leader Nasir Khan Bangu in a rape case.

Earlier, a magistrate in federal capital on September 18 sent Bangu, who is facing charges of raping a girl on gunpoint, to Adiala Jail on 14-day judicial remand after a team of police told judge that they have completed investigation from the accused and needed no more custody of him.

When ASJ Muhammad Atta Rabbani took up the rape case, Zafar Khokhar Advocate appeared before the judge and argued that his client was roped in a bogus rape case.

He said he is a political figure of his area while his political opponents had implicated him in the rape case. He requested judge to grant his client bail in the case.

Opposing the arguments of the lawyer, Ms Aliya Zareen Abbasi Advocate said her client was victimised as she was needy and poor.

“Usually it is not easy for the family of the victim to come forward and set the law in motion in cases of rape. Rape is molestation that the generations have to suffer hence the accused cannot be extended any benefit while considering the bail,” she argued.

The court must observe the previous criminal conduct of the accused and in this particular case the defense has failed to highlight any motive, previous enmity or mala fide on the part of the complainant who is an innocent girl of 20 years only, she said.

Therefore, the court should reject bail plea of accused, argued Aliya Zareen Abbasi Advocate.

After completion of arguments of both parties, ASJ Muhamamd Atta Rabbani rejected the bail of Nasir Khan Bangu in the rape case.

On 7/9/2020, a young girl namely Saima lodged complaint with PS Karachi Company that she was raped by Nasir Abbas Khan on gunpoint after luring her for a job. Police rounded up the alleged rapist after filing a case against him.

A team of investigators of PS Karachi Company had brought the handcuffed PPP leader Nasir Bungu before the court of Area Magistrate Malik Aman on September 18 and pleaded the interrogation from accused was done and his physical custody needed no more by police.

Keeping in line with the oppressive patriarchal norms that dominate most households in Pakistan, a successful Balochi journalist and women’s right activist, Shaheena Shaheen Baloch, was reportedly shot dead by her husband in a family member’s house. Year after year, so many incidents of domestic violence have been swept under the rug as apathetic authorities continue with their strategy of inaction. We have gone much too long without setting a precedent against such outrageous aggression.

Shaheena Shaheen was a respected journalist from Balochistan who had a vibrant career, and aimed to empower women to escape the bounds imposed by society. Such an incident is not out of the ordinary for Pakistan; several women, both successful and otherwise, from all kinds of professions, have faced persecution and violence purely because they rose above and refused to adhere to myopic patriarchal restrictions. Given the regularity with which such crimes are committed, one can only conclude that there is an absence of the fear of accountability for perpetrators. This needs to be rectified.

The reality of Pakistan is that there is little government legislation that aims to protect women, prevent the occurrence of unjustified killings and help incriminate offenders. And in cases where legislation exists, lack of implementation leaves victims without justice. Far too many women have died in vain because authorities have been unable to successfully bring about reforms. A high-profile case like Shaheena’s should be used as greater impetus to charge against accepted norms of male dominance that prevail in our country. This will set the precedent of punishing uncalled for and atrocious crimes but it would also enable the country to pay homage to all those who have been subjugated throughout the course of decades.

Shaheena Shaheen was an asset for the country, and for Balochistan specifically. By letting such a mentality foster, we only threaten the prosperity of our future as potential is either forcefully eliminated or remains untapped because women are confined to a small, insignificant and vulnerable platform.",[],"Year after year, so many incidents of domestic violence have been swept under the rug as apathetic authorities continue with their strategy of inaction.

ISLAMABAD - The cold-blooded murder of a young boy in the jurisdiction of Pahari Pora Police Station Peshawar and the sluggish response by the local po­lice that allowed the murderer to es­cape exposed the poor performance of the so called non-politicised Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa police.

The local police have so far failed to provide justice to the family of vic­tim even after almost one month of the murder in the broad daylight.

Despite a number of reforms intro­duced in KP police, the family of vic­tim has been facing a number of is­sues when they have to approach the police.

A 20-years-old boy name Abid was gunned down allegedly by a person name Shabir over a petty family dis­pute in the Sardar Gari village in Pe­shawar district on December 28, 2019.

The family of the victim later ap­proached the mainstream and social media to lodge complaint that the local police were reluctant to arrest the murderer as the main accused was from a family having a strong in­fluential area.

It is pertinent to mention that de­spite the case was highlighted on the social media, but none of the senior police officers met with the heirs of the deceased in order to ensure them for justice delivery.

However, while talking to The Na­tion, the father of slain boy said that the police did not take the matter se­rious and this gave a chance to the murderer to flee and hide some­where.

He complained that they were still looking for justice and until now po­lice are yet to make any arrest in the case.

He said that if KP police in Charsadda could arrest the son of landlord in a triple murder case then they must deliver them justice too.

He said that the local police were reluctant to arrest the main mur­derer due to their influence in po­lice stations and many other politi­cal quarters. The father of the slain boy told us that the attitude of the police and their behaviour towards him was very harsh and they were not bothering to address his matter carefully.

However, the investigation officer in the case Duran Shah admitted that so far they have been failed to arrest the murderers and provide justice to the family of victim.

Denying the claims of the family of victim Shah Duran said there was no influence of the murderer’s family on the police and they will reach the culprits very soon.

On the other hand, a local from the area without exposing his name told The Nation that police are reluctant to arrest them, saying that the local police were involved in the support of murderer’s family in many other cases.

Another police official said the po­lice were trying its best to reach the accused and numerous raids were conducted and very soon they will get to their target.

Prime Minister Imran Khan in past has defended the KP police many times and has termed it as the best and non-politicised police force of the country.

In a statement on his official Twit­ter account, Imran Khan about KP police had said, “There can be no comparison between the autono­mous, depoliticised and profession­al KP police and totally politicised and nonprofessional Sindh and Pun­jab police.”

He had further said, “The KP Police Act has completely depoliticised the police force, whereas in Sindh and Punjab the police is used to victim­ise opponents and on occasions kill them extra judicially.”

However, the investigation officer in the case Duran Shah admitted that so far they have been failed to arrest the murderers and provide justice to the family of victim.","['20year', 'case', 'provide', 'kp', 'arrest', 'family', 'murderer', 'boy', 'slain', 'victim', 'justice', 'local', 'murder', 'failed', 'peshawar']","{'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/rsss.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/android_app_on_play_logo_small.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/g_plus.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/linkedin_share.png', 'https://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619912693.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png?date=2019-02-15', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/twitter.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_publishrr.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/utube.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/uploads/theme/logo-1550475639.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619902433.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/whatsapp_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/facebook.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/app-store.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2021-05-02/so-what-disaster-are-we-writing-about-today-stories-today-pandemic-pverty-scandal-1619896356-6502.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png'}",True,https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nation,,2020-01-26

Either it is the “dress” or it is the “time” that tempts men. It may be to see her being alone- that is all that takes to blame the victim in crimes which involve heinous behaviour against women. The attempts of rape cases increase with rapid pace. A recent case of an abduction of a girl happened in Clifton, Karachi, where it is believed that a 22-year-old girl was abducted and raped by a gang.

Our country which came into being in the name of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is among the 10 worst countries when it comes to the treatment of women. Does any justice prevail in the state of the word “Islamic?”

3,832 cases of child abuse were reported in 2018 which is 11% more from 2017. Around 10,000 rape cases have been reported in the past 3.5 years, only in Punjab. If we look closely on the data from the provincial dailies on the number of felonies committed against women, majority of them are of child abuse, early marriages, forced conversions, domestic violence, rape and kidnapping, which round up to be 90%

That sums up a whopping 200% increase in crime against women, only just in the past three months compared to what the nation had before.

Is our government just an incompetent one packed with the corrupt. Can it really save our women from these monsters? It is the big question mark on the government whether it is serious to want to tackle these issues.

Paediatricians know that child abuse and neglect is a red line that must not be tolerated. If during a patient encounter, we suspect child abuse or neglect, we suspend the rest of our non-essential agenda until the basic safety and well-being of that child can be assured.

Right now, children who were brought here as migrants and asylum-seekers are being forcibly separated from parents, aunts, uncles and siblings. They are living in overcrowded, dirty detention centres without enough soap, clean clothes or food. Everywhere, children cry out for their missing parents and are consoled by other children.

If any of the children in our clinical practice suffered this way, we would report their parents to child protective services. And yet, the large-scale child abuse and neglect happening at the border is so far out of public view and is sanctioned from so high up in the government that many can, and do, feel powerless.

One of our only recourses is to magnify this issue through the actions of large organisations of people. The American Academy of Pediatrics, in line with its long history of speaking up for vulnerable children, could make a bold statement by focusing on the well-being of children at the border.

What is needed now is bold, symbolic action to draw attention to the gravity of the suffering of these children.

He said the second draft Ordinance namely “Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020” includes the following salient features:-

(i)substitution of the existing section 375 of the PPC with a new provision so as to provide new definition of “rape”, which would extend to females of all ages and male victims under the age of 18 year

It is okay to listen to the news but it’s upsetting to listen to the same news on a daily basis that makes you feel scared and worried. I don’t know why but people don’t understand this fact that when women and girls read and hear about rape, gang rape, sexual harassment, honour killing and continuous victim-blaming, it builds up a kind of trauma in our mind that scares us and we start visualizing things like those women could be us or our loved ones. I know I’m not alone in this; every girl around me may have the same thoughts.

Many people talk about their journeys and about the times that they have gone alone on road trips, travelled all alone and slept in their cars, parks hotels and hostels. What about women? We are not allowed to travel at night. We will be asked: why did she travel without her man, why is she taking her kids with her and many more. We continuously blame the victims, even those who are being raped, murdered and burnt so badly and found somewhere in unrecognizable condition.

Rape culture is actually a social environment that is allowing sexual violence to be normalised and justified and blaming the victims. Rape is not the fault of survivors or victims.

Instead of teaching women to change their appearance and behaviours in order to not get raped, teach men not to rape and respect women. For this we need to reform the societal behaviour over this disease that can not be cured automatically.

Besides society, our system and government have an important role to play to deal with such horrific crimes that we often hear on daily basis. There should be public hanging of rapists so that sick people think twice before shaming humanity.

Please don’t blame the victims, blame and hang the culprits and rapists who targeted those small flowers and our heavens.

May Allah guide us on right path.

A 19-year-old British girl was convicted of making a false claim that she had been raped by a group of 12 Israeli youths and was sentenced to four months in jail, suspended for three years, on Tuesday.

Her gang rape allegation on July 17, 2019, caused an international sensation and a guilty verdict against her issued by a court on Dec. 30, provoked a public rebuke by the British government and a campaign in the United Kingdom to boycott Cyprus as a tourist destination.

Judge Michalis Papanastasiou said in his reserved ruling that he took into account mitigating circumstances in deciding on a suspended sentence.

These, he said in a packed courtroom, included her clean police record, her mental health and her immaturity, her remorse and the fact that she had stayed in custody for a month, missing the current university academic year.

""All mitigating factors were taken into account,"" he said.

The team of lawyers who defended her said they were pleased with the fact that the jail sentence imposed on her was suspended, but warned that they would appeal the sentence at the Supreme Court.

One of her lawyers, Lewis Power, insisted after the sentencing that ""she was the victim of a premeditated gang rape, and was also stripped of her dignity and human rights.""

He added that the appeal would be intended to clear her name.

He said the girl would fly back to Britain later on Tuesday.

As the judge was reading his decision, a group of about 150 women, including about 50 who traveled to Cyprus from Israel, chanted slogans, including one that said ""Judge, shame on you. Don't you have a daughter, too?"" and ""We believe you.""

The latter chant was a reference to her claim made during her trial on a public mischief charge that the police had coerced her into retracting her original complaint and making an admission that she had consensual sex with some of the Israeli youths.

After retracting her complaint, the girl was charged with knowingly making a false allegation, for which the Cypriot criminal law provides of a sentence of up to one year in jail.

The judge said that this was a serious offence, noting that 12 individuals were briefly detained as a result of her accusation.

But he added that he decided to give the girl a second chance, taking into consideration all her personal circumstances.

United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Monday that he had ""very serious concerns"" about the treatment of the woman, and urged the Cypriot government to ""do the right thing.""

In the 1980s, Meredith Maran, an author and journalist, remembered her father sexually abusing her as a child. For eight years she didn’t keep any contact with him. Many years later, she realised that it was a false memory she had. Having immense courage, she wrote a memoir that narrates the fallout from her false accusations of being sexually abused. Her book also touches on themes such as false memory, the sex-abuse panic that hit USA in the 80s and 90s and incited dialogue about empathy for the sexually abused and those who are falsely accused as sexual abusers.

I realise what a sensitive topic I am exploring here and so as I tread carefully, I invite you to open your mind to what I express without slamming me with any label or judgment of not empathising with the victims of sexual abuse. I recently came to know of a social media group being formed where many young girls from local universities and colleges are sharing cases of being sexually harassed and naming the people who have allegedly committed the abuse.

A client of mine reached out for a session overwhelmed, as her fiancée was accused of sexually harassing his friends as well, with the word ‘rape’ being used in connection to him a few years back in his college. I did a joint session for the couple and going by my gut feeling as well as the information shared by the accused, I could see that the reality might be different.

One girl who had accused him was a good friend of his for years posted on the same group that he had sexually harassed her. The immediate question that came to my mind was; why did she not discuss this with him and more importantly why were they friends then? He has text messages to prove his case. He was also falsely accused of raping on a social media forum.

I mean rape is a very serious accusation and to recklessly use that word on a forum like social media is highly irresponsible. So firstly, I definitely believe in listening to anyone who expresses a case of sexual harassment with openness and empathy. It’s a serious thing and no one should be dismissed or the narrative not given a fair chance. Having said that it is also important to hear the accused party’s version. I definitely believe that for the most part, such accusations are authentic but is it fair to paint the canvas with a single splash? This individual for example, is telling the truth where he very courageously admits to a few interactions, which in my opinion were co-created.

Who will take responsibility for the personal and professional damage he might go through? His fiancée was very upset and wanted to know what the truth was, and the only thing I asked her was what her two years of experience had been like, and she said she has never felt so safe in a relationship.

Here I want to discuss a very important concept in psychology called transference. This concept is mostly used in the therapeutic setting. It is the unconscious process whereby a client transfers feelings about their parents, as one example, on to the therapist. It usually concerns feelings from a primary relationship during childhood. Many times, I have been seen as a father figure, a nurturing mother etc. by my clients.

But this transference also happens beyond the therapy setting. For example, when sometimes we meet a new person and we express not getting a good feeling whereas there is no history between you and that person can be a case of transference.

Now why this is important to understand is because transference can cause false memories and contaminate the reality at times. Imagine a scenario; a young girl, who has been sexually abused as a child, never explores it and parks it aside. Now in an adult relationship, she might be minimally physically intimate with the significant other and suddenly starts feeling fear and mistrust even though she was willing in the first place. The interaction will get amplified in her mind as unconsciously, she might see her abuser in the person, which would muddle present facts. She might park this experience as well until someone else steps forward and she finds the courage to talk about this one rather than the original trauma. But transference would amplify the fact and as it is an unconscious process and a very powerful one, she will not be able to see the current reality as it is.

London - The leader of Ireland’s Sinn Fein party, once the political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), on Sunday apologised for the group’s killing of Prince Philip’s uncle Louis Mountbatten.

The IRA killed Philip’s mentor in 1979 as part of a decades-long conflict waged between Irish republicans and those who wanted Northern Ireland to remain in British hands. Mary Lou McDonald’s comment came a day after the husband of Queen Elizabeth II was laid to rest, following his death at the age of 99 on April 9.

“Of course I am sorry that happened, of course that is heart-breaking,” McDonald told Times Radio. “I am happy to reiterate that on the weekend that your queen buried her beloved husband,” she added. It was the first time the political leader of Irish republicans has apologised for the bombing, with McDonald’s predecessor Gerry Adams saying at the time that Mountbatten was a legitimate target. Three other people, including Mountbatten’s 14-year-old grandson and a 15-year-old boy, were killed when the IRA blew up Mountbatten’s yacht in the Irish village of Mullaghmore. Mountbatten was also a mentor to Philip’s son Prince Charles. McDonald said Sunday that “my job, and I think Prince Charles... would absolutely appreciate this, is to lead from the front now, in these times.

“It’s all of our jobs to make sure that no other child, no other family, irrespective of who they are, face the kind of trauma and heartbreak that was all too common sadly in all sides on this island and beyond,” she said.

Around 3,500 lives were lost in the conflict between unionists and nationalists over the future of Northern Ireland that ended with a landmark peace deal in 1998.

Gang violence and gang-rape has been a matter of serious concern in Pakistan for so many years. The heinous act of rape has snatched many lives. It has deep roots in Pakistan since its inception. Since 2000, hundreds of women and teenagers have been gang-raped. Mukhtara Mai in 2002 was gang-raped by the feudalists of the village. She raised her voice and the matter went to the courts as well but she did not get justice. Kainat Soomro, another 13-year old schoolgirl was kidnapped and gang-raped. The process did not stop here but it continued and still is happening across the country. There are so many other cases as well: Shazia Khalid from Balochistan to Zainab from Kasur, all were kidnapped and raped brutally. Though the culprits were punished yet the wounds are still fresh in the hearts of parents and people. Recently, a woman with her children, who was travelling from Lahore to Gujranwala via motorway, was gang-raped when her car was out of fuel and waiting for someone to help.

Pakistan has made certain legislation to stop such brutal acts but they bore no fruit. Section 375 of Pakistan Penal Code stated that girls younger than fourteen years are prohibited from sex. In addition, the 2006 Women Protection Bill and Zainab Alert Bill 2019 were passed by the National Assembly to stop such brutal acts but it seems that all of them are limited to paperwork only. Gang-rape is increasing day by day despite the preventive measures. Therefore, the government should take timely steps to eradicate this disease.

By all means, sexual violence is mammoth mess throughout the world and low literacy rates and unawareness are contributing it. The WHO’s pilot survey cited that one woman out of three is assaulted sexually and physically in the globe. Rape cases are not uncommon in low literacy rate countries such as Africa and Pakistan.

There is a myriad of reasons behind this but lack of education is one of the biggest reasons. Lack of sex education in the curriculum in schools results in children which are not aware of what regards as sexual and physical assault. For instance, New Zealand’s Ministry of Education advertised sex education in new curriculum in the entire schools in 2015 —which curtailed rape cases in some extent. Of late, several heinous incidents: Zainab case, Motorway tragedy, occurred in the country. Therefore, the dearth of sex education in the curriculum has resulted in children who are unaware of what constitutes sexual assault. Because of this unawareness, innumerable rape cases are unreported in the country.

Ergo, lack of education in the society— which emboldens convicts to commit these awful crimes— is the reason why rape cases numbers are multiplying each passing day in the country.

According to a recent technical note titled, ‘Protection of Children During the Coronavirus Pandemic’ by the Alliance for Child Protection in Humanitarian Crisis, children are now at greater risk of child abuse and neglect as they spend most of their time inside their homes under fear, stress and uncertainty. The measures taken to combat the recent corona pandemic including school closure and restricted activity of the entire family has increased stressors amongst parents. While children struggle with their routine and parental expectations, parents worry about parenting on top of job insecurity and making ends meet. Even though it is commonly believed that children are completely safe at home, parents and family members pose a greater risk for violence as the dynamic of trust, power and control interplay.

The corona pandemic has psycho-social impact on the child including child abuse and neglect, mental health issues with increased feeling of helplessness, isolation, fear and anxiety. Other risks include domestic/interpersonal violence, gender-based violence due to gender-imposed roles, child labour due to increased economic demand on the family, separation, unaccompanied children and social exclusion. Special children including those with disabilities, behavioural problems including attention deficit, hyperactive disorder or those who have psycho-social difficulties such as children living in poverty, slums, institutional care or the streets are at a much higher risk of abuse and neglect during this time.

Currently, most of the government’s efforts are to control the spread of the infection and provide relief and recovery of those affected by corona pandemic. The relief package introduced for daily wagers and the underprivileged would help decrease stress on parents, indirectly decreasing violence on children and women. However, it is important to understand that children should also be a key priority during the COVID-19 response. The Minimum Standards for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action, 2019 which is a key resource for humanitarian workers alongside the technical note mentioned above, suggests that advocacy with the government, child-protection specific programming and collaboration is vital for protecting children, especially in such special circumstances.

Unfortunately, in Pakistan the child protection system where prevention and management of child abuse cases is done in a systematic, multisectoral way is already missing. Our professionals such as doctors, teachers, social workers and law enforcers are not trained to detect cases and inter and intra departmental collaborations are not in place to manage children in a holistic way.

This already inadequate system for protecting children needs to be ready for the challenge of an increase in child abuse and neglect with decreased identification and reporting. The authorities need to take substantial steps to incorporate protecting children as a part of their response to fighting COVID-19. As parents and children are over exposed to news on digital and social media, with emphasis on fake news, myths and political talk shows along with the constant updates on number of cases and deaths due to the epidemic, the mental health of parents and children is deteriorating. Just like the awareness campaign about social distancing and handwashing, the government needs to start a mass awareness campaign on information dissemination about mental health, self-care, parenting and engaging children in healthy and creative activities during the lockdown and the corona pandemic. Efforts should also emphasise reducing social exclusion and stigma due to the disease and ways in which children with special needs can be protected from further discrimination. All Pakistani channels, including news channels should be obligated to not only spread this information as public service messages but also dedicate a time slot for child programmes. Social media and digital solutions should also be used to disseminate this information.

According to the international guidelines provided by the Alliance, collaboration and coordination across sectors and governments is essential. Clear standards of care, procedures for documentation and referrals and training of professionals dealing with children about child protection measures during a humanitarian crisis need to be addressed. Clear protocols and mechanisms to ensure the safety of the child in case the parent/caregiver is taken away for treatment or the child is separated from the family need to be established.

Child protection specific programmes need to be introduced in which children, adolescents and parents are meaningfully engaged to understand how the lockdown and COVID-19 has affected their lives. These programmes should focus on designing individual and group activities for the wellbeing of children and families, strengthening families and their environment, involving and engaging communities to spread awareness and identifying strategies for vulnerable groups of children, improving case management systems especially in hospital settings and improving systems of alternative care for children especially those who are unsafe in their own homes.

While most of the efforts are directed towards survival, issues such as child protection and development need to be addressed immediately. Before this becomes an after-thought of a disaster, the government and the authorities need to act fast to fight the short and long-term effects of this pandemic on children.",['Mehek Naeem'],"The measures taken to combat the recent corona pandemic including school closure and restricted activity of the entire family has increased stressors amongst parents.
The corona pandemic has psycho-social impact on the child including child abuse and neglect, mental health issues with increased feeling of helplessness, isolation, fear and anxiety.
Unfortunately, in Pakistan the child protection system where prevention and management of child abuse cases is done in a systematic, multisectoral way is already missing.
This already inadequate system for protecting children needs to be ready for the challenge of an increase in child abuse and neglect with decreased identification and reporting.
While most of the efforts are directed towards survival, issues such as child protection and development need to be addressed immediately.","['protection', 'including', 'children', 'abuse', 'need', 'child', 'pandemic', 'violence', 'parents', 'unseen', 'victims', 'social']","{'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/rsss.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/android_app_on_play_logo_small.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/g_plus.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/linkedin_share.png', 'https://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619912693.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png?date=2019-02-15', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/twitter.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_publishrr.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/utube.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/uploads/theme/logo-1550475639.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619902433.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/whatsapp_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/facebook.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/app-store.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2021-05-02/so-what-disaster-are-we-writing-about-today-stories-today-pandemic-pverty-scandal-1619896356-6502.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png'}",True,https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nation,,2020-04-02

‘The Social Network’ star Armie Hammer has been involved in a ‘cannibalism’ row after an anonymous Instagram account shared a series of messages allegedly from the actor which suggested that he was fantasising about eating parts of female bodies and drinking women's blood. Hammer denied all the allegations.

The Los Angeles Police Department is investigating claims that US actor Armie Hammer “violently” raped a woman almost four years ago.

The probe was reportedly opened when the police were contacted by the attorney of an alleged victim on 3 February, according to the New York Times and CNN. After speaking to the accuser, the department’s Special Assault Section launched an investigation into Hammer, Los Angeles police spokeswoman Norma Eisenman confirmed on Thursday.

The probe was revealed after an accuser, a 24-year-old woman identified as Effie, came forward during an online news conference on Thursday to claim that Hammer “violently raped” her for “four hours” on 24 April 2017. The alleged encounter took place in Los Angeles; the couple is said to have been in an on-and-off relationship between 2016 and 2020 after meeting on Facebook, when the woman was 20 years old.

Effie, who spoke alongside women’s rights attorney Gloria Allred, who organised the conference, said that during their relationship, the actor had “mentally, emotionally and sexually” abused her but the things got out of hand on the day of the alleged rape.

“During those four hours, I tried to get away but he wouldn't let me. I thought he was going to kill me,” the Europe-based woman unveiled while sobbing.

She claims that Hammer has repeatedly slammed her head against the wall during the act and “committed other acts of violence” to which she didn’t consent, including beating her feet with a crop, which left her unable to walk without pain for the next week.

Effie said that the developments left her suicidal and completely “in shock” as she apparently couldn’t believe that someone she “loved did that” to her but tried to justify his actions as a “twisted form of love”.

Hammer’s attorney Andrew Brettler has denied the allegations as “outrageous” maintaining that the actor’s interactions will all his partners “have been completely consensual, discussed and agreed upon in advance, and mutually participatory."" Hammer’s conversation with Effie proves this, the lawyer insists.

""As recently as July 18, 2020, [Effie] sent graphic texts to Mr. Hammer telling him what she wanted him to do to her. Mr. Hammer responded making it clear that he did not want to maintain that type of relationship with her,” Brettler said in a statement sent to the media.

The attorney argued that “it was never Mr. Hammer's intention to embarrass or expose” the woman’s “fetishes or kinky sexual desires” but things have now escalated. Brettler accompanied his statement by an alleged screenshot of conversation between Hammer and Effie.

The woman is the latest person to speak against 34-year-old Hammer, who had been married to TV star Elizabeth Chambers from 2010 to 2020.

The “Call Me By Your Name” star was also accused by his ex-girlfriend Courtney Vucekovich of being emotionally abusive and expressing desire to “barbecue and eat” her on one occasion. Another person, Paige Lorenze, said that the actor wanted to bruise her as a kind of “branding” technique for other people to see it.

The women came forward with their accounts of sexual experiences with Hammer after an anonymous Instagram account “House of Effie” shared screenshots of alleged DMs from the actor to other females suggesting that he was into cannibalism fantasies and sexual abuse, as well as blood-drinking and finger-cutting fetishes. It’s unclear whether the Instagram account has anything to do with the new accuser.

The actor responded to accusations in January insisting that all his extramarital affairs were “completely consensual”.",[],"The Los Angeles Police Department is investigating claims that US actor Armie Hammer “violently” raped a woman almost four years ago.

These trees will include papaya, mango, kachnar, arjuna and various other types. She said the PHA had also conducted a survey in which 20 sites of public parks had been identified across the city to plant maximum trees.

The woman waited for her husband and phoned a relative for help, who advised her to call the Motorway Police.

She subsequently called the Motorway Police's 130 emergency helpline for assistance but was told by the operator that she could not be provided help as the emergency beat had not been assigned to anyone.

While she was stranded on the road, two unidentified armed persons arrived on foot from a nearby area and smashed the window of her car, forcing the woman and her children out of the vehicle.

The notification outlined measures that would ensure that gender-based violence (GBV) trials are conducted in a gender-sensitive manner, while simultaneously pointing towards the inadequacy of the current system where there exist hardly any measures that effectively address the needs of the victim. Such inadequacies are also reflected in the socio-economic indices such as the Global Gender Parity Index. As per the report published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), Pakistan experienced a drastic decrease in its Gender Parity Index ranking from 112 in 2006 to 151 in 2020. This also constitutes a 37-point reduction in the health and survival component over the same time period. Analysed closely, this decrease corresponds to an alarming rise of GBV in Pakistan.

While the law on paper guarantees fairness and due process, victims of gender and sexual-based violence suffer from a host of social and cultural constraints which compromise their safe and easy access to justice. Victims and families are afraid to come forward because of patriarchal notions of honour and shame. Women are often not believed by the police when they report crimes of sexual violence. For the few cases that make it to a criminal trial, the legal process itself can be a source of re-traumatisation due to the misogyny of actors in the justice system, lengthy trial times, repeated exposure to the accused during trial, and an overall environment that holds female victims of sexual and gender-based crimes responsible for the violence enacted on their bodies.

The perpetuation of victim-blaming severely hinders the provision of protection to the victim which is why many countries have enacted “Special Protection Measures” to ensure that victims are not re-traumatised by the legal process meant to deliver them justice. Such measures include fast-track courts in which cases are resolved quickly; physical separation between victim and accused during testimony; and in-camera depositions, to name a few. It has been found that such measures positively enable the victim’s participation in the legal process which in turn makes the prosecution of GBV and sexual violence (SV) cases more efficient as the victim feels more comfortable, confident and safe in testifying. The absence of these measures, however, aggravates the rate of acquittal or promotes premature attrition that may be due to out-of-court settlements and/ or witness or victim resiling. Unsurprisingly. Pakistan finds itself at the disposal of these very apprehensions with a less than 3 percent rate of conviction across the country and a relatively high likelihood of either the victim/ complainant or witness resiling or out-of-court settlements.

While the overall picture is grim, Sindh has been making efforts to recognise gender-based violence as a serious crime and improve prosecution and conviction rates in such crimes. For instance, the Sindh Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection Act) 2013, the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Offence Relating to Rape) Act 2016 and the notification of 27 GBV courts across the country have paved path towards the enforcement of protection mechanisms. But despite great strides on paper, much of the efforts are still at the discretion of individual judges trying the case. This is why one sees isolated efforts such as in the District East Karachi GBV Court where the Senior District Session Judge is working in collaboration with the Legal Aid Society, an NGO supporting state actors in improving their response to sexual and gender-based violence, for construction of separate waiting rooms for the rape and sodomy victims right outside the congested space of the courtroom.

There is a dire need for measures that allocate room for Special Protection Measures such as SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) reinforcing these mechanisms on a national level. As the Human Rights Watch points out, “GBV is both a cause and a consequence of gender inequalities”. Perhaps a coordinated effort to implement special protection measures is one of the ways Pakistan can improve its ranking on the Gender Parity Index.",['Soha Randhawa'],"Share:On October 17, 2020 the Lahore High Court released a notification on guidelines to be followed in letter and spirit in gender-based violence courts.

LAHORE - The first day of Afkar-e-Taza ThinkFest featured thought provoking lectures from renowned personalities from Pakistan and abroad, panel discussions on important topics, reviews of books, exhibitions and musical performances at Al-Hamra on Saturday. The high profile event will conclude on Sunday (today).

Mosharraf Zaidi moderated discussion of panel comprising Pakistan’s former ambassador to Iran Asif Durrani, Ambassador Ashraf Jahangir Qazi, Scholar Barnett Rubin and former Chief of

General Staff, Lt Gen (retd) Waheed Arshad.

Dr Ishrat Husain presented agenda of changes to the bureaucratic structure of Pakistan.

Chevening Journalism program arranged a discussion on Fake News.

Senator Musadik Malik hosted former Chancellor of Berkeley Prof Nicholas Dirks, HEC Chairman Dr Tariq Banuri, Kinnaird College Principal Dr Rukhsana David and LUMS School of Education Dean Dr Tahir Andrabi in panel discussion on role and future of universities.

Speaking at a session on “PakAf: After the Withdrawal” along with Barnett Rubin from New York University, Former Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar said that Afghanistan deserves sovereignty to be respected after anticipated US withdrawal. Najam Sethi moderated the session.

“Afghanistan must also act as sovereign nation and take responsibility of its people living as refugees in Pakistan”, Ms Khar said, adding, Pakistan was facing challenges of economy and security on eastern and western borders, therefore unable to bear the burden of 3.5 million refugees from Afghanistan. “Had Pakistan’s economy been good, it could have kept feeding the refugees from Afghanistan,” she said, adding, Pakistan has own set of challenges to deal with, and can’t take the burden of Afghan refugees. “Even prosperous economies like US were not ready to take refugees from Mexico,” she added. She said that India’s subversive activities from Afghan side were no secret, but National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and ministers were publicly making outrageous statements against Pakistan. “Under current circumstances, Pakistan has no reason to doubt Indian hostile intentions towards Pakistan,” she added.

Speaking at a session on “Is Liberal Democracy Dead?” along with former Portuguese Minister Bruno Macaes, Former Indian Union Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said that his country needed to act carefully or it could end up in a dark alley. Pervez Hoodbhoy moderated the session.

Mani Shankar said that Hindutva in India was just like a concept of Christianity in the West but it hasn’t been accepted by Indians. He said that Hindutva has only been emerged just 90 years ago and suddenly captured India in 2014. “It could go worse in India, but the people of India led by the students and women are resisting it and that’s where lies the hope for a better India,” he said. He urged India not to emulate Pakistan’s example of creating a state based on religion, and must preserve its secular identity. “What India must learn from Pakistan is the smooth way of transfer of power from one democratic government to another in the last three general elections,” he added.

“Women protesters reading out the preamble of Indian constitution in Shaheen Bagh Delhi 24/7 for the last three weeks sent out a message loud and clear that democracy matters. When people are enlightened and resisting like this, the state has to correct itself even if it doesn’t want to,” he said. He said that this battle would continue as the protesting women, students and children hold the candle of hope for the future generations.

“Things get worse before they get better,” said Bruno Macaes, while responding to a question on whether liberal democracy is dead or not. He said that global warming and artificial intelligence were more powerful phenomena than any superpower in the world. “Yes, things will get worse, for now,” he said.",['Iqtidar Gilani'],"Share:LAHORE - The first day of Afkar-e-Taza ThinkFest featured thought provoking lectures from renowned personalities from Pakistan and abroad, panel discussions on important topics, reviews of books, exhibitions and musical performances at Al-Hamra on Saturday.

Conflicts between states and armed groups are either continuing or even escalating in most parts of Sub-Sahara Africa and the situation has made the COVID-19 onslaught even worse, a new report by Amnesty International revealed Wednesday.

Amnesty International Report 2020/21: The State of the World’s Human Rights covers 149 countries - including 35 in Sub-Saharan Africa - and delivers a comprehensive analysis of human rights trends globally in 2020.

“Conflicts between states and armed groups and attacks on civilians have continued or escalated in most parts of Sub-Saharan Africa. In Southern Africa, the long simmering violent tensions in Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado province intensified into full-blown armed conflict,” the report said. “The Horn of Africa region saw an outbreak of conflict in Ethiopia’s Tigray region.”

It said: “At the same time, armed groups maintained a foothold in West Africa and the Sahel region, attacking civilians in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria. They blighted many lives in Cameroon, the Central African Republic (CAR) and Chad. In response, state security forces also committed grave human rights violations against civilians.”

The report added COVID-19 worsened the already precarious situation of refugees, asylum seekers and migrants in many countries, trapping some in squalid camps, cutting off vital supplies, or precipitating border controls that left many stranded.

For example, Uganda, the largest refugee-hosting country in Africa with 1.4 million refugees, immediately closed its borders at the start of the pandemic and did not make an exception for refugees and asylum seekers trying to enter the country. As a result, over 10,000 people were stranded along its border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Incidences of gender-based violence also have been on the rise with raging conflict situations coupled with COVID-19.

It said 21 women and children had been killed by intimate partners in South Africa by mid-June, while over 3,600 rapes were recorded during the COVID-19 lockdown in Nigeria. In CAR, the UN recorded 60 cases of conflict-related sexual violence, including rape, forced marriage, and sexual slavery, between June and October.

It added the pandemic was being weaponized.

The recent harassment cases disclosed by students of LGS 1A1 highlight the deep-rooted issue of missing child protection systems within schools. Keeping the definition of a child, anyone who is under the age of eighteen (according to United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child) in mind, the disclosures are not just that of harassment but of child sexual abuse (Pakistan Penal Code). While the Prime Minister said that this government is following a zero-tolerance policy against child abuse last month, there is a dire need for systems of early identification, management, reporting and redressal.

Like many developing countries, Pakistan is struggling with systems for protecting children. Mostly when incidents of abuse and harassment surface, they are often silenced or brushed under the carpet. If they get attention, they are often mishandled, sensationalised and then forgotten. With a reactionary approach to child abuse and neglect, focusing only on punishing the perpetrator or victim blaming, systematic management is never paid attention.

Schools can also play an important role in prevention, management and reporting of abuse. With close interactions and dynamics of trust and power, students can be at a risk of abuse and neglect within the school. These include physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse and neglect. While teachers and administration often misuse their authority, blurring the line between discipline, grooming, abuse and exploitation, abusive and toxic behaviours are normalised. When issues such as bullying, name calling and online safety are not addressed by the school, it affects the student’s mental health and grades, contributing to the cycle of abuse.

A multisectoral, multidisciplinary and a multistakeholder approach needs to be taken to combat violence against children in every setting. There is no act or law for mandatory reporting or that binds schools to have a child protection policy and a regulatory body to ensure that they have mechanisms to prevent violence. This results in a diffusion of responsibility where schools take no substantial steps to protect their students. A majority of schools have not paid attention to safety protocols such as CCTV cameras even in classrooms, anti-bullying policies, background check and vetting of all staff including visiting faculty, volunteers and custodian staff and a designated child protection officer or a body that specifically deals with issues related to violence against children. The code of conduct usually signed by new recruits do not have clauses pertaining to child protection such as not being alone with the student at any given time.

While most teachers in private schools do not go through graduate programmes in education, early identification and management of abuse is not a part of teacher training curriculum taught in graduate programs. Apart from some ad hoc in-service training, most teachers are not adequately sensitised or aware of basics such as forms of abuse, their definitions, identification of red flags including physical and behavioural cues.

There is an urgent need to work on systematic changes which caters specifically to violence against children in schools. Provincial Child Commissions need to be established and a Child Protection Policy needs to be in place. A Child Protection Information Management System and an Offenders Registry needs to be introduced and maintained. Education sector plans should focus on safe learning and preventing violence against children. A school child protection policy needs to be devised with a regulatory body which ensures that schools are following safety protocols addressed in the policy. Every school should have a child protection committee, with student and parent participation and a trained designated child protection officer. It should be made mandatory for all personal interaction with the student, be it teacher, coaches or even custodian staff to have a police certificate along with basic training on child protection. All graduate Education programmes should cover human and child rights, trauma and child protection in detail. Basic life skills and body protection should also be taught to students via age appropriate content and awareness campaigns addressing issues such as bullying and online safety should be encouraged. Special attention should also be paid to children with special needs and those who are more at risk.

A school, being a place where a child spends more than six to eight hours a day not only needs to have a conducive learning environment but a safe space. This is only possible through consciously and actively building efficient systems for protection.",['Mehek Naeem'],"Share:The recent harassment cases disclosed by students of LGS 1A1 highlight the deep-rooted issue of missing child protection systems within schools.

ISLAMABAD - Senate Standing Committee on Commerce and Textile on Thursday expressed displeasure over the performance of Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) that failed to enhance the country’s exports in last several years.

Senate Standing Committee on Commerce and Textile, which met under the chair of Mirza Mohammad Afridi, discussed three points’ agenda. The committee members were annoyed over the performance of TDAP, which has the mandate to increase the country’s exports. However, they noted that TDAP has failed to increase the exports of the country in last many years. Senators have noted that TDAP has become burden over the national kitty. TDAP has no fund to organize exhibitions in other countries, which is essential for enhancing the exports of the country. The committee has sought detailed performance report of the TDAP from the ministry of commerce in next meeting.

The committee has also recommended the government to appoint chairman Export Processing Zone Authority (EPZA) immediately. The committee members noted that EPZA is a platform, which could play important role in increasing foreign exchange reserves and foreign investment in the country. Senators said that government should appoint EPZA head with immediate effect to make it functional.

The parliamentary committee has stressed the need for eliminating under-invoicing to check money-laundering through trade of IT equipment. Committee chairman Afridi said that committee is giving importance to resolve under invoicing issue, as it is one of the major problems in economy. He said that government should formulate a strategy to control the under invoicing. Senator Shibili Faraz said that economy is facing massive loss due to the under invoicing. It is also affecting the local production.

The committee was informed that government has formulated a mechanism to control under-invoicing through trade of IT equipment. The exports of IT equipment would be cleared under the new mechanism. Earlier, the companies, which were importing computers and other equipments, were involved in under-invoicing that resulted in massive loss to the national exchequer. Member Federal Board of Revenue Jawad Agha informed the committee that taxes and duties on the import of IT equipments are not high in Pakistan.

Chairman Afridi said that committee had highlighted the issue of under-invoicing. After that, the FBR had also identified $5 million under-invoicing in IT sector. Therefore, the government had accepted the committee recommendation and formulated strategy to check the under-voicing. The FBR had also appreciated the Senate Standing Committee on Commerce and Textile’s role in identifying the issue of under-invoicing, which is causing huge loss to the national exchequer.

Officials of Customs Intelligence informed the committee that there were 17 cases that found in under-invoicing through trade of IT equipment. The committee was further informed that they are also reviewing banking channels to check the under-invoicing through trade of IT equipment. Later, the committee has directed the government to submit detailed report on the issue of under-invoicing through trade of IT equipment by March 15, 2020. The committee has noted that there is need to improve the performance of Pakistan Revenue Automation (Pvt.) Ltd, (PRAL). Senator Dilawal Khan said that the government should audit the PRAL.

The committee meeting was attended by Senators Shibli Faraz, Dilawar Khan, Ghous Mohammad Niazi, Nuzhat Sadiq, Atta-ur-Rehman and officials of ministry of commerce and Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).",['Imran Ali Kundi'],"Share:ISLAMABAD - Senate Standing Committee on Commerce and Textile on Thursday expressed displeasure over the performance of Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) that failed to enhance the country’s exports in last several years.

Sexual behavior pattern among human species vary from culture to culture. Cases of rape had also been recorded in pre-literate and pre-modern societies. Men’s propensity to commit rape has been associated with different factors, for instance among pre-literate societies, rape attempts were mainly observed in the context of male competition for women. In modern societies, the main reason is presented to be the prevalent patriarchal family structure which presumably makes men to commit rape. Brown Miller's famous remark that rape is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear, can be viewed as an explanation to the aforementioned notion.

In Pakistan, there are different issues faced by marginalized groups. And one of the most prevalent inflictions faced by women and children is the unabating rise in rape incidents. In September 2020, the gang rape of a woman on Motorway in Punjab, sparked national outrage. People took out to roads and demanded justice for the victim and urged the government to take serious action and give policy guidelines to harness the aggravating rape cases. In November, a new bill was presented before the president. The key takeaways of the ordinance include; a countrywide registry of sexual offenders to be established with NADRA, chemical castration of repeat offenders, disclosing the identities of the victims to be a punishable offence, premier’s Anti-Rape Crisis Cells to be setup, establishment of special courts for speedy trials.

The bill was presented before the federal cabinet with the assertion that castration will not be with the consent of the victim. This is a serious issue which needs to be discussed. According to some researches, the recidivism rates among sex perpetrators were low, but it also has other complications. Offenders who are castrated under coercion (without consent) might, for example, illicitly obtain testosterone or other anabolic steroids in order to reverse the effects of castration.

There is another factor related to it, sometimes the crime of rape is committed by sex offenders out of the desire for power over others. Chemical castration may serve to lower the sex drive, but it is not evident that it will erase these motivations for sex crimes. Furthermore, a sex offender may deepen his aggression when he contemplates his loss because of chemical castration, possibly increasing the probability of further volatile situations.

In any case, professionals have argued that castration is not a good solution to decrease recidivism among rape perpetrators. Moreover, in Pakistan everyone has this preconceived notion in their minds that no matter what crime they commit, they can escape the shackles of law. Hence, it is more important for the government to ensure speedy trials and punishment to the offenders, as certainty has greater impact on deterrence than severity of punishment.",['Beenish Fatima'],"Men’s propensity to commit rape has been associated with different factors, for instance among pre-literate societies, rape attempts were mainly observed in the context of male competition for women.
In modern societies, the main reason is presented to be the prevalent patriarchal family structure which presumably makes men to commit rape.
There is another factor related to it, sometimes the crime of rape is committed by sex offenders out of the desire for power over others.
Chemical castration may serve to lower the sex drive, but it is not evident that it will erase these motivations for sex crimes.
In any case, professionals have argued that castration is not a good solution to decrease recidivism among rape perpetrators.","['chemical', 'antirape', 'ordinance', 'presented', 'women', 'reduce', 'sex', 'societies', 'recidivism', 'victim', 'offenders', 'castration', 'rape', 'commit']","{'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/rsss.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/android_app_on_play_logo_small.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/g_plus.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/linkedin_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2020-12-21/cartoon-1608493776-2616.jpg', 'https://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619912693.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png?date=2019-02-15', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/twitter.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_publishrr.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/utube.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/digital_images/medium/2020-12-21/will-anti-rape-ordinance-reduce-recidivism-1608535107-5891.jpeg', 'https://nation.com.pk/uploads/theme/logo-1550475639.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619902433.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/whatsapp_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/digital_images/large/2020-12-21/will-anti-rape-ordinance-reduce-recidivism-1608535107-5891.jpeg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/facebook.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/app-store.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png'}",True,https://nation.com.pk/digital_images/large/2020-12-21/will-anti-rape-ordinance-reduce-recidivism-1608535107-5891.jpeg,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nation,,2020-12-21

Recently there has been great outrage at our holier-than-thou Prime Minister’s statement where he insinuated how women dress has a correlation with increasing cases of rape and sexual violence in the country. He said, “In any society where vulgarity is prevalent, there are consequences.”

The Prime Minister also said women in Pakistan should remove “temptation” because “not everyone has willpower” and advised ‘purdah’—perhaps inspired by the first lady.

I equally respect women who observe purdah and those who don’t. It’s an individual’s choice and their own value system of what purdah or lack of means for them.

The biggest argument for what IK stated—and I wish someone had questioned the esteemed PM—is that if vulgarity invites sexual offence then how do you explain a 5-year-old child being raped by grown up men?

As a therapist, I would like to give my insight into the psychology of an offender/abuser. First of all, my dear PM, temptation has nothing to do with a man wanting to rape or sexually assault a woman. It is also not as simple as saying not indulging in a non-permissible sexual act is about willpower or lack thereof.

The abuse by an abuser is about what is inside him and not what is outside of him. It’s not like ‘she made me do it.’ It’s more like ‘I want to do it and I don’t care if it’s a woman in a so-called vulgar dress or a purdah clad woman.’

Raping or sexually abusing someone is about the perpetrator and never about the victim. A sexual assaulter can be any kind of a person and studies have shown that some of the personality traits include apathy, narcissism and feelings of hostility and aggression towards women. Remember that a sexual assault is not about sexual gratification or sexual interest, but more about dominating the other as one always has ethical and healthy options of gratifying the same needs.

One common cause in our culture can be the need of such young men to exert superiority over their male peers by flaunting that they are highly sexual beings. Such men would most likely be failures in life and can feed into their false male egos by considering themselves an alpha male by sexual acts. The excessive watching of porn is also a contributing factor and can increase sexual frustration.

In any culture, being a male and a virgin is a lot of pressure and would be stigmatised. Many of these men are almost in a panic and sense of emergency to join the bandwagon of other male adults. In most cases, religious boundaries would not matter. Many of these men also feel that this act gives them a sense of dominance, especially in a patriarchal society like Pakistan where the male child is made to feel superior since he comes into the world. If he is not living a healthy socially active life, he would go for anything that can give a sense of this fake masculinity.

In our culture the shame around sexuality, patriarchy and dominance are all sublimated through a kind of dehumanisation in which women are seen as inferior beings to men. This makes it much easier for women to become the targets of bellicosity.

There is also another kind of rapist that looks for any opportunity of gratification and loses self-control under the influence of substance. Another type is the heartless rapist whose stimulus is to humiliate and degrade his victims. He might even have an undiagnosed mental health condition like psychosis or sadistic tendencies that leads him to this heinous crime.

Then there is the vindictive rapist or offender who has anger and hostility focused directly on women, maybe due to personal history. Such sexual offenders believe they are allowed to sexually attack women because they feel they have been hurt, rejected or wronged by women in the past.

There is also intergenerational trauma history that leads to such personalities being formed, which means a son growing up in a household where the father constantly has physically abused the mother will most likely turn him into an adult that does the same towards other women.

Sexual assault is an unforgivable act of violence and a crime. Unfortunately, a lot of the victims remain silent to avoid stigmatisation and being blamed by society, while their rapists go free. It gets ingrained in the psyche of the victim that she is to be blamed for what happened due to judgment by society. And when the head of a state makes such an irresponsible comment, I can’t even imagine how many more victims of abuse will remain silent or never come forward. Dear PM, please make an educative and responsible statement next time on such a sensitive and painful issue. Invite an expert to give you a better understanding into the psyche of such crimes before blurting out your own introjects.",['Zara Maqbool'],"He said, “In any society where vulgarity is prevalent, there are consequences.”The Prime Minister also said women in Pakistan should remove “temptation” because “not everyone has willpower” and advised ‘purdah’—perhaps inspired by the first lady.

Stockholm-Police in Sweden say they’re struggling to control criminal “clans” exercising their own form of justice, amid an escalation of violent crime in what has long been a tranquil and safe country.

With close family loyalties and little regard for the authorities, a few dozen criminal gangs now wield considerable influence over some of Sweden’s disadvantaged neighbourhoods, say experts.

Shootings, bombings and grenade attacks have become regular events in cities and towns across the country. Media outlets report on drug wars, blackmail, and witnesses too fearful of repercussions to testify.

“Have you seen the movie ‘The Godfather’? Then you know what it’s like,” journalist Johanna Backstrom Lerneby, who wrote a book about one of Sweden’s most infamous crime families, told AFP.

Gang members tied to the family Backstrom Lerneby wrote about recently made headlines in Sweden when, during a feud with a rival gang in August, they set up makeshift roadblocks, stopping cars and asking to see passengers’ ID cards.

One young man interviewed by broadcaster SVT, who would not give his full name but claimed to be involved in the car checks, said the controls were set up to “protect residents and children in the area”.

The feud came to a halt in late August -- but not because police arrested any suspects.

Instead, members of several gangs met at a Gothenburg hotel and agreed to end hostilities, effectively ending the strife overnight.

“It’s very frustrating, because it is a good solution in the short term... but it was resolved in the wrong way,” local police officer Fredrik Terje told SVT, deploring that authorities had been sidelined as criminals set the agenda.

The problem of these “criminal clans” has made headlines since early September, when deputy police chief Mats Lofving told Swedish Radio there were at least 40 family-based criminal gangs in Sweden.

“Far from everyone wants to be a part of Swedish society,” Lofving said, adding these families had come to Sweden solely for the purpose of committing crime, bringing with them their own parallel systems of government.

Lofving said these families were making their way into business and politics in order to wield more formal influence, primarily in disadvantaged suburbs, many of which have a large proportion of residents with immigrant backgrounds.

Sweden has struggled to integrate many of its immigrants, with thousands failing to learn the language proficiently and find jobs in its highly skilled labour market.

“Those who live in these vulnerable areas are often relatively poor people who don’t have a choice, even if they wanted to move away,” Backstrom Lerneby said.

The violence has also harmed innocent bystanders. In early August, a 12-year-old girl was killed by a stray bullet in a drive-by shooting in Stockholm, sparking an outcry over the ruthless violence.

In early September, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven called the criminal gangs a “poison in our society that we need to get rid of”.",[],"With close family loyalties and little regard for the authorities, a few dozen criminal gangs now wield considerable influence over some of Sweden’s disadvantaged neighbourhoods, say experts.

LAHORE - An anti-terrorism court in Lahore on Saturday sentenced two men to death over the gang rape of a French-Pakistani mother, lawyers said, an attack that prompted nationwide protests and tough new anti-rape legislation.

The ATC convicted Abid Malhi and Shafqat Ali, prime accused and co-accused, in the Motorway gang-rape case after charges were proved against them. The court handed down death sentence to both the accused under Section 376 of Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) for rape.

The court awarded life imprisonment to both accused under Section 365-A of PPC for kidnapping the victim and confiscating her property. Besides imposing Rs 200,000 fine each, the court also awarded 14 years imprisonment to both accused under Section 392 of PPC for robbery.

The court awarded five years imprisonment to both accused under Section 440 of PPC for mischief, besides imposing Rs 50,000 fine. The accused were also ordered to pay Rs 100,000 each as compensation to the victim under Section 337-F1 and 337-L2 of the PPC for causing injury to the victim.

ATC Judge Arshad Hussain Bhutta announced the verdict at Camp Jail in the presence of the accused, their counsel, Deputy Prosecutor General Hafiz Asghar and Deputy Prosecutor General Waqar Bhatti. The court had reserved the verdict on March 18 after hearing detailed arguments of parties.

‘Solid evidence’

The prosecutors argued that the accused gang-raped the victim woman at gunpoint and solid evidence was available against them. They argued that the accused were arrested after their DNA matched with the samples collected from crime scene whereas the victim woman also identified them during identification parade held in the presence of the magistrate. They also submitted that co-accused Shafqat admitted the crime before a judicial magistrate. They pleaded with the court for handing down strict punishment to the accused as they committed a heinous crime.

However, the defence counsel opposed the plea, saying that the prosecution failed to prove presence of accused Shafqat on crime scene whereas the identification parade of Shafqat Ali was held after 22 days of his arrest. They submitted the statement of accused Shafqat was recorded after a delay of one month and eighteen days whereas he was forced to get record his statement. The defence also questioned the authenticity of the identification parade while raising various questions on process adopted during it.

It is pertinent to mention here that the prosecution presented 37 witnesses, including the victim woman, during the trial.

The Gujjarpura police had filed a challan against the accused, wherein they were declared guilty. The police had requested the court for awarding strict punishment to the accused as sufficient evidence was available against them.

On September 9, the accused- Abid Malhi and Shafqat Ali, allegedly raped a woman at gunpoint in Gujjarpura area while she was waiting for help on the motorway after her car ran out of fuel.

An FIR of the incident was lodged with the Gujjarpura police under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA).

‘Anger’

The woman was attacked in September last year in front of her small children on the side of a motorway after her car ran out of fuel near the southern city of Lahore.

An outpouring of anger was further fuelled by a police chief who chided the victim for driving at night without a male companion. “They’ve both been handed the death penalty,” Chaudhry Qasim Arain, a lawyer for both men, told reporters after the verdict and sentencing hearing. The two men would appeal the decision, announced at an anti-terrorism court in Lahore.

The attack and the subsequent demands for better protection of women prompted the government to introduce new legislation, including the establishment of special courts to speed up rape trials and the chemical castration of serial rapists.

‘Chemical castration’

Chemical castration of rapists involves using drugs to reduce a person’s libido. It was backed by the country’s Prime Minister Imran Khan but activists said it was unclear how it would act as a deterrent.

Pakistan is a deeply conservative nation where victims of sexual abuse often are too afraid to speak out and criminal complaints are frequently not investigated seriously.

The country has an abysmal rape conviction rate, with official data putting it as low as 0.3 percent.

According to the rights groups Justice Project Pakistan, the number of prisoner executions has fallen in the past few years to 15 in both 2018 and 2019. Many death sentences are later commuted to life imprisonment terms.

At the time of the gang rape, Lahore police chief Umar Sheikh repeatedly berated the victim for driving at night without a man, adding that no one in Pakistani society would “allow their sisters and daughters to travel alone so late”.

Sheikh went on to say the woman -- a resident of France -- probably “mistook that Pakistani society is just as safe” as her home country. Thousands took part in protests, demanding justice and an increase in spending on initiatives that improve women’s safety, as well as an end to victim blaming.

Much of Pakistan lives under a patriarchal code of “honour” that systematises the oppression of women and those who supposedly bring “shame” on the family can be subjected to violence or murder.

Karachi - Caritas Pakistan’s Karachi chapter and the Catholic Women’s Organisation (CWO) jointly organised an awareness seminar with women and girls on forced conversion, child marriage and women’s rights.

The event took place in Kausar Naizi Colony, a Christian neighborhood of St Jude’s Parish of the Archdiocese of Karachi, on Nov 13. The objective of the seminar was to create awareness in the context of the Arzoo Raja case. Arzoo, a 13-year-old resident of Karachi’s Railway Colony, was abducted, married off to a 44-year-old Muslim man and converted to Islam. Her family is fighting a legal battle for her custody.

The case sent shockwaves throughout Pakistan, prompting religious minorities, particularly Christians, to hold nationwide protests. “Mothers play a very important role in family building to protect young girls from falling into the trap of wolves who prey on young girls and change their religion,” said Sister Catherine Qasir, a CWO coordinator.

“We must daily pray with all family members to spiritually strengthen and renew our faith in Jesus Christ and to fight against the forces of evil.” Tabassum Yousaf, a high court lawyer and counsel for Arzoo, shed light on the legal rights of minority girls as per the constitution of Pakistan. “Although abduction of an individual for the purpose of forced marriage is a criminal offense in Pakistan, it is one of, if not the most, widespread reported crimes against women in the country,” she said. Yousaf advised girls about how to keep themselves safe. She urged them to memorise the cell phone numbers of their parents and siblings.

She called on mothers to spend time with their daughters, befriend them, patiently listen to their problems and address them with love, care and respect.

“We must reinforce our commitment to provide quality education and equal opportunities to our young girls and children and start this from our family,” she added.

Mansha Noor, executive secretary of Caritas Karachi, said the Arzoo Raja case provides a useful opportunity for mothers and girls to learn about the menace of forced conversion and child marriage and their negative impact on society.

“What we learned from this seminar we must share with others and start implementation from our family if we have to save and protect young girls and children,” Noor said.

“We must remember the most beautiful quote of St Mother Teresa on the family that ‘the family that prays together stays together, and if they stay together they will love one another as God loved each one of them.’”",['Our Staff Reporter'],"Share:Karachi - Caritas Pakistan’s Karachi chapter and the Catholic Women’s Organisation (CWO) jointly organised an awareness seminar with women and girls on forced conversion, child marriage and women’s rights.

Rabat-A Moroccan court sentenced a 24-year-old to death Wednesday for the rape and murder of an 11-year-old boy, in a case that has sparked calls for renewed executions.

Th North African country had 74 prisoners on death row at the end of last year but has not carried out an execution since 1993.

The case of the young boy, identified only as Adnan, has triggered renewed debate since his body was found dumped in September, five days after his disappearance from the working class district of Tangier where he lived.

The accused was arrested after he sent a ransom demand to the child’s parents in an ill-conceived bid to put police off his trail by persuading them money was the motive.

He was accused of keeping his victim captive in his rented apartment, raping him and then killing him before burying the body nearby. “The court was persuaded of the guilt of the main accused in the crime of premeditated murder, linked to abduction, captivity and statutory rape,” the official MAP news agency reported. The defendant’s flatmates, who were tried with him, were jailed for four months each for failing to report the crime, MAP said.

Over the past two decades, Morocco has moved to reduce the number of prisoners on death row, by commuting their sentences to life imprisonment or fixed jail terms. A total of 119 prisoners were removed from death row in this way between 2000 and 2019.

There has also been renewed debate about child protection in Morocco and the sentencing of child rape cases.

In June last year, the release on bail of a man accused of raping a six-year-old girl sparked public outrage which prompted his swift return to custody.

In 2013, a royal pardon granted in error to a convicted Spanish paedophile triggered a wave of street protests.",[],"Share:Rabat-A Moroccan court sentenced a 24-year-old to death Wednesday for the rape and murder of an 11-year-old boy, in a case that has sparked calls for renewed executions.

The recent allegations of sexual harassment that have emerged at schools and universities in Lahore should surprise no one. We have been here before and we will be back here again. Without institutions taking responsibility for putting policies and trainings in place, and without wider society reflecting on our unwillingness to talk about harassment, we are bound to repeat these patterns.

In late 2019, students at University of Balochistan spoke up about being recorded by CCTV cameras at private spaces across campus and being blackmailed over it. The FIA carried out an investigation, and while it appears no one was charged, the university’s Vice Chancellor stepped down. However, he was promptly hired by a private university in Lahore.

Just this month, students at LUMS in Lahore have bravely spoken up against the behaviours by men on campus that they have been unable to take up before the university’s sexual harassment committee.

What is it about sexual harassment that refuses to go away? It crops up in educational institutions, public and private, in every part of the country. It crops up in workplaces and sports clubs alike. Sexual harassment, it appears, is everywhere. The mind panics, and, one leans towards gender segregation and surveillance across campuses as a solution to this menace. But these solutions are already part of campus life and have not ameliorated the problem.

The Punjab Education Minister, Dr. Murad Raas, has been among many to suggest that men not be allowed to teach at women’s campuses to curb this problem. But this is hardly the solution. Inherently, it implies that men are incapable of controlling themselves around women and girls, an implication we should all find offensive. It is also an imperfect solution for a world where all genders intermingle at offices and public spaces alike. The suggestion also ignores the fact that sexual harassment and sexual assault are common at boys’ educational institutions. An approach that teaches all of us to respect difference and personal space would serve us better.

Another knee-jerk solution adopted by schools and backed by parents is of increasing the use of cameras on campus. This is an expensive solution that cannot be replicated at public schools. Security footage is highly susceptible to being copied or leaked, as has been the case at Lahore’s Safe City Authority in the past. Our privacy and the ownership of our own body is important to us, and we should be careful about normalising the idea of sacrificing it for the illusion of safety.

Some suggestions of dress codes on university campuses and schools have also been put forward. Proponents of this approach forget that dress codes and distancing between the sexes are already mandated at public and private university campuses alike. No amount of covering protects women from being assaulted and harassed in public, as women are acutely aware.

All these solutions are short-sighted and misguided. Their proponents forget that what breeds sexual harassment is power, supported by a culture of silence. Decades of feminist research has established that sexual harassment counts on the victim being cornered into compliance because of the power the harasser holds over her—he is her teacher who grades her papers, a professor who supervises her thesis, a department chair who signs off on her academic documents, the campus security supervisor who no one can question and who has access to all security cameras. At the very least, the harasser is a man whose word will always be believed over that of a woman. A woman’s credibility depends on her moral character being absolutely beyond doubt.

This power difference is worsened by a culture of silence. Our ideas of shame make it hard to talk about anything sexual in nature, including unwelcome sexual advances. All educators understand that the word ‘sex’ even as part of ‘sexual harassment awareness’ is not welcome in Pakistan society. School girls, women at university and working women alike would always prefer to handle sexual harassment on their own, or ignore it altogether, rather than have their parents find out about it. They worry that they will be blamed for inviting this behaviour, or at the very least, have their mobility curbed on the pretext of better security for them. Our cultural silence around private affairs cannot distinguish between welcome and unwelcome sexual interaction.

To address this power differential, we need to introduce curriculum in schools that educates children about overcoming this shame, how to spot and address sexual harassment. We need robust, well-trained and independent sexual harassment committees in schools and universities, efforts for which are already underway. Institutions need to ensure that their committees are transparent and independent, not just populated by the very administration that students cannot trust.

Students, in turn, need to be empowered to speak up. Trainings on harassment are one way to do that. But they will fall short until students feel safe in numbers in being able to complain against a popular teacher. This comes with robust and independent student government and student unions on campus. Censoring students’ activities online, as some schools have begun doing, has the opposite effect and will only silence reports of sexual harassment further.

As a society, we need to have honest conversations about how we perpetuate this culture of silence. The taboo of sex must be overcome, ideas of consent and ownership, control and protection of one’s body need to be strengthened. In post-Kasur Pakistan, we have become exhausted from hearing of sexual crimes despite increased punishment and introduction of new laws. Now, it is our duty to turn to social rather than purely legal solutions, or we are bound to repeat these mistakes again.

LHC adjourns hearing of

Babar Azam’s plea

The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday adjourned hearing of a petition, filed by skipper of national cricket team Babar Azam, challenging orders for registration of the case against him, for a month.

The court remarked that the matter would be heard after Pakistan Super League (PSL) matches. The single bench comprising Justice Asjad Javaid Ghural heard the petition filed by Babar Azam.

He submitted that the police had also reported that claims of Hamiza Mukhtar about threatening calls were not true. He pleaded with the court to set aside the orders being illegal. He requested to stop implementation of the orders till the final decision of the petition.

The most encouraging and promising feature of the current government is its willingness and readiness to eradicate the ills and bring reforms at various levels despite limited resources and endless challenges both internally and externally. 760 PIA employees, including 17 pilots, were sacked in August 2020 over the issue of fake qualifications. A devastating plane crash (PK 8303) from Lahore to Karachi and the subsequent loss of 100 lives on the unfortunate day of 22 May 2020 necessitated reforms in the aviation industry. Massive urban flooding and infrastructural damage during the recent monsoon told the tales of poor governance in Karachi since decades. A 1.1 trillion-rupee package came as the Karachi Transformation Plan to deal with mega city woes. Pakistan is referred to as one of the top seven countries to have dealt with Covid-19 situation effectively by an international newspaper. The issues of governance and political corruption are deep-rooted. Yet, the current government is readily taking measures and dealing with domestic concerns efficiently. Out of a myriad of social issues, the crime of rape carries graver impact from social, psychological, economic, to structural aspects of the country. It is increasing with every passing day, subjecting 50 percent of the total population to risk, anxiety, insecurity and constant fear. The horrifying motorway rape incident on September 10, and several others reported and un-reported rape assaults in other parts of the world, is reflection of moral and social decay as a human society.

Rape is more than a sexual violence. According to Prof. Johan Galtung, Father of Peace Studies, ‘violence is an act of direct, indirect, physical, mental, sexual, emotional, psychological, social, cultural and structural harm and damage to human beings’. Killing, physical or sexual abuse, punching or hitting someone; torturing and inciting stress and anxiety, discouraging; not addressing an issue at policy and structural level; legitimising or justifying a crime or any form of violence under the ambit of culture or religion—these all are various forms of direct and indirect violence. Framing ‘rape crime’ under this definition of Prof. Galtung, it sadly fulfils the criteria of both direct and indirect, physical and non-physical, sexual, mental, emotional, cultural, structural, social, psychological, economic violence.

Rape stigmatises a person for life; it diminishes prospects of working and living with respect and dignity in a society because somehow society still does not blame the rapists but rejects the raped. What does the future hold for her? A married woman would get divorced after the incident. A working lady would quit her job and career. A young student would stop pursuing her education at the university. A house wife or a mother would be cursed for a crime she never committed. They live with the fear for their entire life. The trauma is immense, both tangible and intangible. Therefore, rape crime has to be taken as an alarming problem so that urgent and collective action can be taken.

Many countries have stricter laws to punish rapists. Public hanging or victim shooting the rapist is the punishment in Iran, beheading or stoning to death in Saudi Arabia, life imprisonment in the USA, shooting in the head within four days of the trial in Afghanistan and public execution in North Korea are examples of this law. In Pakistan, a multi-pronged strategy needs to be adopted urgently. First, the implementation of the law of hanging rapists publicly or stoning them to death. This should be done speedily without any delays or wasting time in trials. When the rapists are arrested, medical reports prove the crime; painful and strict public punishment will set an example for other potential rapists. They need to fear the law and its implementation.

Second, police emergency numbers and calls should be taken as the primary source of help, regardless of time and location. More active patrolling on highways and motorways, along with more police booths, should be established and easier access and urgent response on the first call for help need to be there. Making police stations safer for the victim to register an FIR in and giving behavioural training to police officers should be a priority so that they are able to provide support for a traumatised victim empathetically rather than making it difficult for her. We need to have more women police officers at various levels to provide a comfortable environment to the victim during the process rather than harassing her with obnoxious questioning posed by male officers.

Thirdly, social reforms, involving each and every platform, need to be enacted to contain the threat and crime of rape. It may be a combination of consciousness, effort and action. It has to be an overhauling process. Few years ago, YouTube was banned over the issue of blasphemous content. In the same manner, illicit content should warrant the ban of pornographic websites and all potential proxies that give access to such sites. We need to sensitise young boys and girls about rape crime at all available forums –homes, educational institutes, mosques and madrassahs, work places and the like. They should be taught that nothing rationalises rape; neither a situation, time nor a dress. They should learn the importance of saying and accepting a ‘No’. There is no masculinity in overpowering a woman through sexual violence. Misogyny resides in the individual’s mind and is manifested at institutional or organizational level when the individual is in a powerful position. Some misogynists rape the women, other hold her responsible for the crime. The treatment for rape crime revolves around law and society. Normalise speedy justice and human rights, not rape.",['Dr Maria Saifuddin Effendi'],"Out of a myriad of social issues, the crime of rape carries graver impact from social, psychological, economic, to structural aspects of the country.

LAHORE - Over two dozen investigation teams formed by the government to probe the gang-rape incident on the Motorway remained busy the entire day on Friday collecting the evidence from the crime scene and other sources but failed to find any clue about the criminals.

In its first report submitted to Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar on Thursday, the Punjab police claimed to have arrested 15 suspects during a search operation conducted in the adjoining areas of the crime site.

A five-member committee constituted by the chief minister with the provincial law minister as the convener held its meeting on Friday to investigate the case. An investigation team formed by the provincial police chief also remained busy working on the case on Friday but could not get at the rapists.

Other investigation teams including the one led by Lahore DIG (Investigations) Shahzada Sultan and a crime investigation agency separately working on the case did not report any further progress on the gruesome incident.

Punjab Law Minister Raja Basharat and IGP Inam Ghani inspected the crime scene on Friday as part of the investigation into the case. The law minister in his media talk earlier in the day termed it a “blind incident” with no clear evidence that will have to be collected through investigation. He said that 28 different teams were investigating the case and the evidence collected so far from the site had been sent for forensic examination. He also informed reporters that a medical examination of the victim had also been conducted.

He termed the case a challenge for the police as well the government. He said as many as 500 additional vehicles were being purchased for the police to improve police patrolling on the highways. Law minister further stated that the government would take measures to prevent such incidents in the future.

Responding to a question, Raja Basharat said that the Punjab government will also investigate as to why the motorway remained unmanned since its inauguration.

Punjab IGP Inman Ghani told the media that police had obtained data from NADRA of men between 25 and 35 years of age living in the nearby villages besides conducting profiling of 70 young suspects. The police chief also claimed that police had got some clues from the crime scene that could lead them to the culprits.

Also, Law Minister Raja Basharat chaired a meeting at civil secretariat on Friday in connection with the Motorway incident. Additional Chief Secretary Home, Additional IG Special Branch, DIG Investigation Punjab, DG Forensic Authority, NHA and Motorway Police officers also attended the meeting.

The NHA officials told the meeting that they had been sending letters to Motorway officials since January this year, but security had not yet been deployed. The law minister said that this was a very tragic incident for which strict action would be taken after determining the responsibility.

Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar on Friday contacted the Provincial Law Minister Raja Basharat who is heading the investigation committee probing the motorway rape case. The Law Minister apprised the CM about the progress made in the investigation of motorway rape case.

The CM directed to move forward the investigation in the scientific manner adding that investigation should be completed in the stipulated period of time and all aspects should be examined. “It is a test case which will have to be brought to the logical end without wasting any time. I should be continuously informed about the progress made in the investigation”, the CM further said. He assured that the perpetrators will not escape from the stricter punishment according to the law.

Also, Information Minister Punjab Fayyaz ul Hassan Chohan, in his statement on the Lahore Motorway Rape incident, said that the Chief Minister Punjab Sardar Usman Buzdar was closely monitoring the ongoing investigation. A high level committee headed by Minister of Law and Parliamentary Affairs Raja Basharat was investigating the matter with the assistance of Additional Chief Secretary Home, Additional IG Special Branch, DIG Investigation, Forensic Department and CIA using traditional and modern investigative methods. Fayyaz-ul-Hassan Chohan said that this horrendous incident had left the whole nation mourning.

COVID-19 has not only unleashed a new political challenge and economic meltdown on countries, the pandemic has exacerbated some social issues like domestic violence as well. Since the world has gone into lockdown, many reports and studies from around the globe show a rise in domestic violence cases. And Pakistan is no exception to this social problem.

Indeed, there are legal statutes and other sets of protective mechanisms in all four provinces of the country. Nevertheless, they fail in tackling the cases of domestic abuse in the lockdown days. And the situation becomes more complicated due to the circumspection on the part of victims in reporting such incidents. Most of such victims find it difficult to contact authorities because of the presence of the perpetrators in the house and the fear of further violence.

True, the government is dealing with multiple challenges that the global pandemic is posing. However, the authorities cannot ignore the issue at hand that is becoming grimmer. The gaps in the legal framework which aims to protect women and girls from domestic abuse allow the abusers to carry on with their violent behaviour and actions. The legislature must work on filling up all these gaps and consider the challenges that COVID-19 is posing in reporting of domestic abuse incidents. Presently, the victims are locked in with their abusers, with little to no hope of intervention from authorities or the outside world.

Additionally, poor social services or their nonexistence make it impossible for victims to escape from their abusers or get any justice. The state must work together with the Ministry of Human Rights and other rights advocacy groups to come up with a solution for curbing the spike in cases of domestic violence. If the authorities ignore the problem, the situation will only get worse for the victims of domestic violence in the coming days if the lockdown continues.",[],"Share:COVID-19 has not only unleashed a new political challenge and economic meltdown on countries, the pandemic has exacerbated some social issues like domestic violence as well.

Domestic violence and abuse can happen to anyone, it does not discriminate. It is used for one purpose: to gain and maintain total control over an individual. An abuser doesn’t play fair. An abuser uses fear, guilt, shame, and intimidation to wear you down and keep you under their thumb. It occurs within all age ranges, ethnic backgrounds, and economic levels. And while women are more often victimised, men also experience abuse, especially verbal and emotional abuse. The bottom line is that abusive behaviour is never acceptable, whether from a man, woman, teenager, or an adult. You deserve to feel valued, respected, and safe.

Domestic abuse often escalates from threats and verbal assault to violence. And while physical injury may pose the most obvious danger, the emotional and psychological consequences of domestic abuse are also severe. Emotionally abusive relationships can destroy your self-worth, lead to anxiety and depression, and make you feel helpless and alone. No one should have to endure this kind of pain and your first step to breaking free is recognising that your relationship is abusive.

Many men and women suffer from emotional abuse, which is no less destructive. Unfortunately, emotional abuse is often minimised or overlooked even by the person experiencing it. If you suspect that someone you know is being abused, speak up! If you’re hesitating, and telling yourself that it’s none of your business, or that the person might not want to talk about it, you might be wrong. Keep in mind that expressing your concern will let the person know that you care and may even save their life.

The video clip of a son beating his mother that went viral on social media sites is just an ugly reality of our society that we often try to brush under the carpet. While the police have already registered a first information report (FIR) against the man and his wife, the menace of domestic abuse is not going away with one police report. The video shows us how deep the issue of domestic abuse and violence is. According to the 2019 Women, Peace and Security Index, Pakistan ranks 164th out of 166 when it comes to women’s safety and protection.

Despite the introduction of new laws to protect the women from abuse, especially domestic violence, the situation is not improving. Merely introducing laws that lack proper implementation, and establishing helplines do not mean that the state has fulfilled its responsibilities regarding women protection. Despite the introduction of pro-women laws that criminalise domestic abuse, the barriers in ensuring justice to the victims are too many. The state needs to remove all these obstacles so that the victims of domestic violence can seek a swift remedy. The laws also need further improvements and clarity in their language.

Pakistan seems to have done little to change attitudes and practices. Notably, the most important ones who need a change in their views on the menace of domestic violence are police and courts. They must not see the cases of domestic violence as private family matters; what was basically standard procedure up until very recently. All institutions, especially the police and the legal fraternity, need to receive gender sensitivity training. Essential to our understanding is that domestic abuse is not just about a husband abusing his wife. All women in our families are at threat as long as we do not tackle the problem head-on. Combating violence against women needs to be observed from all angles if the aim is creating gender equality.",[],"The video shows us how deep the issue of domestic abuse and violence is.

LAHORE - Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Interfaith Harmony Hafiz Tahir Mehmood Ashrafi said on Monday that government would not allow anyone to take law into hands on the basis of religious differences.

He was addressing a press conference at Central Cathedral Church here along with Christian community representatives including National Council of Churches in Pakistan (NCCP) President Bishop Dr Azad Marshal.

He said that forced marriages, forced conversion of religion and abduction of underage girls of other religions in the name of marriages would not be tolerated at all. He said that human rights ministry, in consultation with other stakeholders, was working out a mechanism to eliminate the fear of forced marriage among non-Muslims. He mentioned that efforts were being made at every level to create interfaith harmony through formation of councils.

He said, “Islam is a religion of love and peace, and grievances of the Christian community regarding underage girls’ marriages and forced conversion were being probed thoroughly”. He promised that justice would be dispensed at every cost.

Ashrafi said that rights of every citizen were clearly laid down in the Constitution of Pakistan, irrespective of caste, creed or religion. He said that according to vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan, no one should be afraid of any group.

Ashrafi said the government, in consultation with Ulema, was striving for proper use of the 295-C law that relates to blasphemy in true sense of words. He regretted that law had been misused in the past, but now its misuse would be brought to an end.

India’s Uttar Pradesh state has ordered a federal probe into the alleged gang-rape and assault of a 19-year-old woman following protests. The state government has also suspended five police officials.

India’s main opposition Congress party on Sunday demanded that the District Magistrate of Hathras in Uttar Pradesh be removed due to his role in cremating the body of the alleged gang-rape victim without the permission of the family.

Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who met the family members of victim on 3 October, said the family had been treated badly by the top district official. Vadra, in a tweet in Hindi, called for his removal and an inquiry into his omissions. He also reportedly warned the family to remain silent.

​The victim of the alleged gang-rape and assault died in a Delhi hospital on 29 September and her body was cremated by the district administration of Hathras in the early hours of 30 September.

Uttar Pradesh police had fortified the village and stopped access to lawmakers and media, some 200 kilometres south of Delhi, claiming it would disturb the law and order situation there.

Following widespread protests, the state government ordered a probe by the federal agency, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and lifted the siege of the village.

The arranged-vs-love-marriage debate goes back a long way. The West has generally done away with arranged matches, but the issue is still unsettled; the institution of arranged marriage is still alive and kicking.

Ardent advocates of both types of marriage exist. Some cynics, however, argue that it doesn’t make much of a difference whether a marriage is arranged or ‘love’. Due to a lack of better options, I have been forced to use the conventional prefixes (‘arranged’ and ‘love’), which leave a lot to be desired really as both arranged and love marriages have something in common: Love inevitably forces the couple to make a lot of arrangements, and love lurks somewhere in arranged-marriages too. It is still an arranged-marriage even if you fall in love with the photograph of your betrothed.

Supporters of arranged-marriages contend that a collective decision is bound to be better than a man deciding on his own. A little reflection tells a different story, however. Probability dictates that a solitary man is more likely to find a decent wife than his mother finding the ‘perfect’ daughter-in-law. Not just that, but other family members will also want a say. In fact, it will be a miracle if all of them end up agreeing on any candidate.

In praise of love-marriages, it is often said that the couple already knows each other by the time they get married. I doubt if they do, really. In a country where there are no live-in relationships (thankfully), and limited contact overall, it’s easy to present the best version of oneself, raising false expectations that are bound to result in disappointment and disillusionment after marriage. In this regard, love-marriages are no different from arranged-marriages, where both families can behave impeccably until the union.

He said Prime Minister Imran Khan, after taking serious notice of a recent rape incident of a mother and her daughter in Sindh, asked Law Minister Farogh Naseem to prepare a comprehensive ordinance, encompassing fast-track trial of the accused, comprehensive definition of rape, inclusion of new offences and strict punishments for the convicted rapists.

The minister said as the ordinance was of great importance and involved punitive actions against the rapists, it was forwarded to the Law Division for further improvement.

He expressed the hope that the initiative would significantly reduce the number of rape incidents in the country by creating deterrence against the offence in the society.",[],"Share:The Federal Cabinet on Tuesday gave in-principle approval to the anti-rape ordinance, aimed at curbing the growing number of rape incidents in the country through inclusion of stringent punishments in the contemporary laws.

London-Pressure intensified Tuesday on the UK government to act over claims that a “rape culture” is “endemic” throughout the country’s education system, after thousands of victims’ testimonies were collated online.

Politicians and education leaders were among those calling on ministers to respond following the deluge of first-hand accounts of sexual abuse, assault and other misconduct posted anonymously on the website “Everyone’s Invited”.

Created by 22-year-old Sara Soma last summer, it has catalogued nearly 10,000 testimonies from more than 38,000 contributors, detailing harrowing alleged incidents ranging from catcalling to rape across schools, colleges and universities. The number of reports has increased dramatically since the disappearance and death of 33-year-old Sarah Everard as she walked home in London this month, sparking outrage and a national debate on women’s safety.

“From the testimonies ‘Everyone’s Invited’ has received it is clear that rape culture is endemic,” Soma wrote in The Times newspaper this week.

“Let’s hope there is a snowball effect and rape culture is better understood, and eradicated,” she added. “It’s in all parts of society including all universities and all schools.”

We often hear that women are being victimized by abuse, domestic violence, harassment, injustice, exploitation and many other problems in the modern world. Whether it is friendship, relationship, business, household or any other purpose, women are always the sufferers. So, the question arises, why? Why are women always oppressed? Why is this world so unfair to females?

By nature women are more emotional. They think from heart rather than using their mind. In every state, a woman has her emotional levels greater than anything else and she uses these sentiments for taking decisions as well. Whether she is a mother, sister, a girlfriend or wife, she has a sensitive attachment to the concerned person and will always try to resolve things peacefully by letting go. This causes her more harm as people take advantage of her and then leave. Women who are more practical and realistic tend to be more successful in their lives as they make decisions by analyzing all facts. Being a slave to your emotions and having no control over them can lead to risky consequences.

It is common for women to trust people for no reason. Not only in relationships but in common dealing and matters as well, women believe people without any reason, which leads to their exploitation. Trusting blindly is one of the women’s biggest mistakes – they do and then regret. Mostly in relationships, girls have faith in their partners up to an extent that they do not see the reality and other factors which are in front of them. For them everything is as their partners show them. They do not believe their parents, or friends, as far as their relationship is concerned. When their trust is broken, they realize that they trusted the wrong person, but it’s too late by then – they have been emotionally and mentally exploited enough. The pain of a heart break for a woman is not easy to bear, but till that time all she can do is regret the past and be careful for the next time.

It is often said that women are bad at keeping secrets. It does not seem a big deal, but it makes a huge difference. Women are more likely to open up to their partners rather than anyone else,and it is obvious that they would trust their partners the most. They usually fail to keep their personal affairs, family matters, individual space and professional life hidden from their spouses or boyfriends, which gives them a chance to blackmail or attack the women personally whenever they have a fight or going through a breakup. Keeping personal space is very important in relationships, or even in marriages, because no matter how good your partner is, he might not remain the same forever. Telling your secrets to people is like giving them a key to access your heart; they may keep it or break it anytime they want.

One of the most prominent facts is that women – especially in the eastern world – have less exposure to the world as compared to men. They are not as practical and think whatever they see or being told by their family or friends. On the other hand, men are more sensible at making decisions. They do not believe what they just see, but make their choices by making proper analysis of the circumstances and future consequences. So when it comes to making the life decision, women are most likely to fall for guys they like without pondering over the other factors like family, future, financial status etc. It might be the cause as to why they get exploited easily – emotionally or financially. However, later in their married life, they regret the decision.

One of the chief reasons for victimization of women is that they are not financially and emotionally independent. Even a modern and working woman needs a man to make her living, as the society does not allow women to live individually. When one cannot take decisions on her own, is not allowed to do anything without permission, is not able to lead a life of her own choice, how can you expect her not to be the victim of issues like domestic abuse, sexual and financial exploitation or harassment? This is because the majority of the women do not have any backup support, or anywhere to go, except the husband’s house so she has to compromise anyway.

Many women live in a world of fantasy. It seems very irrational but this is an element not to be ignored. Women usually visualize their lives based on novels and dramas where a prince charming enters her life and makes everything beautiful for her:Cinderella’s prince changed her life and they lived happily ever after. Unfortunately in real life, nothing like this happens. Famous characters of novels like Salaar, Jehan Sikander, Edward Cullen – someone who loves the girl, fights for her, treats her like a princess and so on. His charming looks, a height of 6 feet, army uniform, bold character and romantic feelings are the fantasies that every girl has, and when any of these gets fulfilled they start visualizing the same life they have seen in stories. Sadly, life is much bitter, and when it shows the true colors, poor girls’ hearts have already been broken.

Women are more emotional by nature and always have a soft corner for the ones they love. No matter how bad has been done to them in the past, when it comes to forgiving, they easily forgive the person and give him another chance just by seeing his tears. For them a crying man is a symbol of being guilty rather than improving his actions. When people know that another chance will be given to them, they keep repeating the same actions, because they know how to justify them. They play blame game by acting as a victim and blaming their partner for their abusive behavior and actions. They know that their partner is not going to leave them and will be easily convinced. Women are not firm on their decisions to leave a person permanently;they just keep giving warnings and second chances and keep getting disappointed on false hopes that they would change.

It is said that men move on more easily as compared to women. One of its main reasons is that men accept the reality and are more realistic. They keep themselves engaged in their work and routine so that they forget things easily. On the other hand, women keep thinking about the past – how happy they were before, how people were before, why did everything change – and keep blaming themselves or others for what happened rather than accepting the reality and letting go. They get more emotionally attached to someone they love and take more time to move on, which is the main reason that they keep on being deceived on the hope that things can turn back to be normal.

Majority of the women especially in the east are taught that their husbands are their God. They have to obey them in every matter and because of that women suffer a lot. They have to tolerate everything even that is unjust, just because of their partner’s wish. At some point women become so used to the injustice done to them, that they teach their daughters the same thing and the trend goes on and on. In the eastern world, women are blamed for destroying their married life so they keep on bearing the abuse of their husbands and in-laws just because of the fear that their married life would get damaged.

This is a natural fact that women are physically weaker than men. They are powerless in many cases just because of their gender and have to be silent. The fact that a large number of women are raped, harassed, acid attacked, kidnapped, beaten and killed by men is because as they are helpless owing to the difference in physical strength. Sexual exploitation of women is also very common in marriages or relationships because of the same reason. Especially in the eastern countries, where the law and order situation is full of corruption, it is not easy for women to get justice.",['Zoha Masood'],"Women who are more practical and realistic tend to be more successful in their lives as they make decisions by analyzing all facts.

Last week, the cabinet had approved the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Ordinance 2020 and the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance 2020 in an effort of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government to curb the increasing rape cases.

The government intends to introduce tough laws at a time when there are rising incidents of rape in the country including motorway gang-rape case that had caused countrywide unrest among people.

The Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance proposes to amend the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 to effectively tackle the pervading instances of rape and sexual abuse of women and children.

The proposed law for the first time has included rape victims not only women, and children but also men and transgender persons.

The law widens the definition of rape by including provision of gang rape, and sexual violence, and defining the consent. It says that consent in rape would not be regarded “by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication” or if the victim is unable to understand the nature and consequences of that consent.

IT is raining anecdotes of harassment and violence against the students across the country. Whether it happens in the premier educational institutes of Lahore, shabby buildings of government-run schools in Southern-Punjab, or a dilapidated madrassah in interior Sindh; sexual harassment and assault in academic institutions is always downplayed.

Educational institutes often believe they can inoculate themselves against legal action and tarnished reputation by denying and ignoring incidents of sexual harassment and assault on their premises. Usually, the investigations in such incidents are delayed; responsibilities are denied; facts are distorted; victims are disparaged and their right to an equal education is devalued.

The recent harrowing anecdotes of sexual harassment in two leading educational institutes of Lahore present scenarios of familiar negligence and institutional apathy. A bunch of female students stormed social media with the videos, pictures, and messages they received from their perpetrators: teachers and staff. Many accused the instructors of inappropriate touching, groping, coercing, and threatening. The harassers warned the students for a reduction in the marks in case of non-compliance. All this happened right under the nose of the administration which kept sitting on the complaints until everything emerged on the social media accounts of the students.

The subsequent vehement public response on social media and the support the victims received from the alumni and public alike speaks volumes about its rampant prevalence in Pakistan. Absence of an effective anti-harassment committee and lack of seriousness led to prolonged misery of the victims who finally summed up their courage to speak-up after several years of agony.

Ignorance, fear of liability, concerns about the public opinion, and bad press is what keeps most schools and varsities turn a blind eye to their utmost obligation: providing a safe and equal opportunity of education to the students.

Schools and varsities claim to take sexual harassment and violence very seriously, yet most of them neither have their anti-harassment policies well defined nor have their harassment inquiry committees working effectively. Preparedness and readiness to tackle real incidents on campus are entirely missing.

When sexual harassment in schools goes un-addressed; the victim is stigmatized. Culprits leaving with impunity creates a culture of violence, aggression, and harassment in society. The notion ‘boys will be boys’ is reinforced. The students learn that sexual misconduct is acceptable, even normal. Impressionable minds of minor students in schools make harassment even more alarming. Several are unable to come out of the traumatic experience they had in their schools for the rest of their lives. Students’ self-esteem stoops low; self-doubt spikes high.

Experts opine that beliefs and attitudes about healthy relationships and sexuality take place early in life and schools must play their part to identify the problem and encounter it by use of words, curriculum, policies, and school culture.

Teachers, school administration, and staff including the gatekeepers, drivers, cleaners, janitors also need training about sexual harassment so they become part of the solution rather part of the problem. Vivid discrimination between bullying in schools and sexual harassment can prepare educators to deal with the issue aptly and educate the students effectively to speak up about their experiences of sexual harassment.

Schools must devise comprehensive strategies to protect themselves from liability of sexual harassment. Hushing away the victims of assault, violence and sexual harassment harms the very students the schools are to protect in the first place. Addressing the issue and striving to solve is the most pragmatic approach to tackle harassment in educational institutions.

Similarly; it is vital for the students that they must also understand and report sexual harassment before it is too late. In the USA, every student has to go through comprehensive online training about sexual harassment and the importance of intervention by the bystanders to avert incidents of harassment and violence on campus. Consequently, every student is well aware of what action or statement can be termed as sexual harassment; how to tackle it, and actions needed to help someone in need. There are several student-run clubs on the campus providing support to the victims and creating awareness about harassment and violence on campus.

In Pakistan, the government helpline to receive complaints about sexual harassment can be accessed. Complainants can also directly go to the ombudsman person who initiates the legal proceedings with confidentiality. Online complaints are is filed with Federal Investigative Agency. Parents, on the other hand, must also educate children from a very young age at home about sexual harassment.

Sexual violence in schools and on campus is a pressing civil rights issue: depriving many of equal and safe access to education. Educational institutes should strive to nip the evil in the bud; rather than denying the problem until it can no longer be hidden and burst out on social media.",['Muhammad Ali Falak'],"Educational institutes often believe they can inoculate themselves against legal action and tarnished reputation by denying and ignoring incidents of sexual harassment and assault on their premises.

LAHORE - The Lahore High Court (LHC) was informed on Friday that Punjab government removed the condition of two-finger test (TFT) for medico-legal examination of sexual assault survivors.

Punjab Additional Advocate General Jawad Yaqoob presented a copy of the notification/revised guidelines issued by the Punjab Specialised Healthcare and Medical Education Department for medico-legal examination of sexual assault survivors in the court.

Justice Ayesha A Malik had reserved the verdict on two petitions challenging two-finger test for examination of sexual assault survivors due to being disrespectful, inhuman and in violation of fundamental rights of women.

The court had reserved the verdict on November 10 after an Additional Advocate General Punjab assured the court that the condition of TFT would be removed and a notification would be issued soon for the purpose.

The petitions were filed by a PML-N MNA, women rights activists, academics, journalists and advocates.

As per notification/revised guidelines, the medico-legal examination of a female victim should be undertaken only on the judicial order as per Women Protection Act, 2006 and after obtaining written expressed consent of the victim or parents/guardian in case of minor. The examination can only be performed by an authorized women medical officer or board under Section 299-C of the Pakistan Penal Code, it added.

It also noted that victims or guardians had the right to refuse medico-legal examination or collection of evidence or both but their refusal would not be used to deny treatment to the survivor after sexual violence as per the Injured Persons (Medical Aid) Act, 2004.

The guidelines also mentioned other steps that needed to be followed during the medical examination including noting down of bio-data information, history of change of clothes, baths taken etc, besides asking to specify the type of violence and areas of the body injured.

“General physical examination should be done in detail. Particular emphasis should be on apparent age, mental status and development of secondary sex characteristics, besides noting BP, pulse, temperature and respiratory rate,” it added. The notification clearly stated that a two-finger test must not be performed and it had been written in all caps and made bold.

It is also recommended in the guidelines to collect swab samples within 96 hours of the assault.",[],"Share:LAHORE - The Lahore High Court (LHC) was informed on Friday that Punjab government removed the condition of two-finger test (TFT) for medico-legal examination of sexual assault survivors.

LAHORE - The two men involved in the gang rape incident on Lahore’s motorway are identified and a manhunt is underway to arrest them, police and top government officials said on Saturday.

Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar said the “real culprits” of motorway rape incident have been identified in less than seventy-two hours. While addressing a news conference in Lahore, he said the investigation of the case was started on a scientific line and he was personally monitoring the probe. “We have traced the accused in less than 72 hours of the incident and the investigation on scientific lines was also under way,” the chief minister said. “I have contacted the victim woman and assured her of providing complete justice.” He said the accused involved in such heinous crimes would not be spared any at cost.

On this occasion, IG Punjab Inam Ghani said the accused would be arrested soon as the police were conducting raids on various places, including Qila Sattar Shah area in Sheikhupura. The police had traced record of the accused and investigation on modern techniques was being carried out. A police spokesman released pictures of both the suspects on the social media on Saturday evening. The suspects are identified by police as Abid Ali, a resident of Fort Abbas, Bahawalnagar and Waqar-ul-Hassan, who belongs to Qila Sattar, Sheikhupura.

The IG said other law enforcement agencies, including the CTD, were also conducting raids to arrest the accused at the earliest.

Two ‘robbers’ allegedly raped a woman at gunpoint in Gujjarpura area on Wednesday while she was waiting for help on the motorway after her car developed a fault. In his statement on the incident on Thursday, the CCPO implied that the victim shared responsibility for her rape. He claimed that the victim, who is a foreign national, thought it was safe to travel at night with her kids. He also said the victim was at fault for ""choosing the route she took and not checking her petrol tank"" before heading out.

Ahmed is seeking the court's approval to submit additional evidence in the primary petition filed by him on Wednesday that challenged the Punjab government's decision to remove Shoaib Dastgir from the post of inspector general of police after he developed differences with the Lahore CCPO.

Ahmed's first petition in the LHC argued that pre-mature transfers in the police force violated the Police Order (2002) and the Punjab government's rules of business.

Paris-No country has been spared the coronavirus epidemic, nor the scourge of domestic violence, which has surged during lockdowns as the day marking such violence approaches on Wednesday.

From a spike in rapes in Nigeria and South Africa, increased numbers of women missing in Peru, higher rates of women being killed in Brazil and Mexico and overwhelmed associations in Europe: the pandemic has aggravated the plague of sexual violence.

According to UN data released in late September, lockdowns have led to increases in complaints or calls to report domestic abuse of 25 percent in Argentina, 30 percent in Cyprus and France and 33 percent in Singapore.

In essentially all countries, measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus have resulted in woman and children being confined at home.

“The house is the most dangerous place for women,” Moroccan associations noted in April as they pressed authorities for “an emergency response”.

In India, Heena -- not her real name -- a 33-year-old cook who lives in Mumbai, said she felt “trapped in my house” with a husband who did not work, consumed drugs and was violent.

As she described what she had endured, she frequently broke down in tears.

After buying drugs, “he would spend the rest of his day either hooked to his phone playing PubG (PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds) or beating me up and abusing me,” she told AFP by telephone.

Insufficient measures

On August 15, her husband beat Heena worse than before, in front of their seven-year-old son, and threw her out of the house at 3:00 am.

“I had nowhere to go,” she said. “I could barely move my body -- he beat me to pulp, my body was swollen.”

Instead of going to the police, she made it to a friend’s home and then to her parents.

She is now fighting for custody of her son, “but courts are not working in full capacity due to Covid”. She has not seen her son in four months, though he manages to call her in secret from time to time. It is not the just the courts that are hobbled by the virus. The closure of businesses and schools, as well as cultural and athletic activities, have deprived victims already weakened by economic insecurity of ways to escape violence.

Hanaa Edwar of the Iraqi Women’s Network, told AFP there had been “a dangerous deterioration in the socioeconomic situation for families following the lockdown, with more families going into poverty, which leads to violent reactions”.

In Brazil, 648 murders of women were recorded in the first half of the year, a small increase from the same period in 2019 according to the Brazilian Forum for Public Security.

While the government has launched a campaign to encourage women to file complaints, the forum says that measures designed to help victims remain insufficient.",[],"Share:Paris-No country has been spared the coronavirus epidemic, nor the scourge of domestic violence, which has surged during lockdowns as the day marking such violence approaches on Wednesday.

“There are two powers in the world; one is the sword and the other is the pen. There is a great competition and rivalry between the two. There is a third power stronger than both, that of the women”

–Quaid-e-Azam M.A. Jinnah

The founder of Pakistan, Quaid e Azam, had great respect for women. His views on women were shaped and informed over a lifetime spent in the company of strong-willed, educated and professional women, like his sister and close confidante, Fatima Jinnah.

During the final decades of his life, Fatima was side by side with her brother, sacrificing life, wealth and property for a higher purpose; to fight against oppression, tyranny and colonisation and to lead millions toward a new homeland.

During the freedom movement for Pakistan, both men and women collectively struggled for independence as equal citizens in a new state.

But despite the Quaid’s clearly expressed vision of social and gender equality, the Pakistan that he created still has a long way to go to guarantee his ideals in the private and public spheres.

Over the last seven tumultuous decades, during democracy and dictatorship, Pakistan has witnessed gross and shocking human rights violations, including a very troubling record of sexual violence.

Pakistan is among those countries where 70 percent women and girls experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime by their intimate partners, and 93 percent women experience some form of sexual violence in public places (Source: Madadgaar National Helpline 1098 and national commissioner for children, Zia Ahmed Awan).

The Zainab rape case in Kasur, back in 2017, brought the abuse of helpless young children by sexual predators to an international spotlight.

The recent horrific sexual assault on a mother by two men, while she was waiting with her children on the motorway, has shocked an entire nation. It has also reopened the wounds of many who have suffered this kind of violence in the past.

This rape incident was committed in the presence of the mother’s two children and illustrated the diabolical, devilish desire for power and dominance these sick monsters crave.

The children who are brutally harmed will recover from their physical injuries, but it will take a lifetime to heal their mental scars. So who is to blame? A society that breeds these monsters and stays in denial? This motorway incident reflects the alarming and rapidly accelerating breakdown of morals and ethics in Pakistan. Education, family, friends & community mindsets of a nation are all responsible for shaping the views and character of an individual.

Many women groups have expressed heightened fear, coupled with an extreme lack of confidence in state institutions’ ability to provide speedy justice.

The silver lining of this latest dark cloud is that people across the cultural spectrum have been outraged. This outrage has been affirmed in the street protests, on television current affairs programs, social media, animated and fierce debate in Parliament, including the opposition and the ruling party.

PM Imran Khan has publicly, on the floor of the house, acknowledged the cataclysmic damage sexual assault brings to Pakistani society. The PM has promised to put the entire state machinery into overdrive to address the nation’s outrage & palpable fear.

Life-destroying crimes like rape require strategic deterrence.

More policewomen need to be hired and engaged in law enforcement and a more robust medico-legal infrastructure has to aid in the investigation.

The conviction rate in rape cases in Punjab is less than 10 percent. In 74 percent of the cases, witnesses seem to have withdrawn out of fear; the lack of witness protection mechanisms is among the underlying causes of the victim’s silence. Specially trained women lawyers and judges should oversee all cases of rape and sexual assault.

All rape cases should be a capital crime. A country is known for its culture and its adherence to the rule of law. The punishment for drug smuggling in the United Arab Emirates is death. All nations accept it as the law of the land. The crime rate in the Emirates is very low.

A recent Gallup poll shows that the majority of Pakistan wants capital punishment for rapists. Pakistan should be known as a country with zero tolerance for those who prey on defenceless women and children. Enough is enough for sexual violence.

A change in behaviour and mindset of state and society leaders is urgently required instead of victim shaming and blaming. A community needs to stand squarely against the perpetrators of sexual violence. Without these strategic reforms, Pakistan cannot transition into a peaceful, prosperous and vibrant culture.

When mothers and children are not safe, no progress can be made. Another disturbing development that has accompanied the Motorway outrage is the violent incidents of sectarianism after Muharram.

Whether orchestrated by anti-state elements or borne out of wanton ignorance, it is worth remembering that, the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) “Rehmat Ul Alameen”, mercy to all nations, was neither a Shia nor a Sunni nor any other denomination of Islam; he was a Muslim.

After Hijrat, in 622, When he arrived in Madina, he addressed the divisive warring tribes of Yathrib, who searched for leadership & conflict resolution. The prophet (PBUH) underlined a fundamental truth. “I am from you and you are from me.” During his final Khutbah in Makkah, history’s first universal declaration of human rights “All humanity is from Adam and Eve. An Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab, nor a non-Arab has any authority over an Arab; also a white has no power over a black, nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and right action.”

In his words and deeds, He also reinforced respect and cooperation between men and women. “Do treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners and committed helpers.”

We all have to speak in one united voice against those who commit these horrible crimes on women, children and men. If we in the Pakistani media and civil society continue to play a constructive, activist role, it will serve as a vital check and balance on all those who consider themselves above the law.",['Dr Salman Ahmad'],"During the freedom movement for Pakistan, both men and women collectively struggled for independence as equal citizens in a new state.

LAHORE - Punjab Law Minister Raja Basharat on Thursday said the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government was taking concrete steps to curb child sexual abuse. He was speaking as a chief guest at a workshop on child sexual abuse here.

Provincial Minister for Minority Affairs and Human Rights Ejaz Alam Augustine, Chairperson Child Protection Bureau (CPB) Sarah Ahmed, Country Coordinator Muslim Charity UK Zubair Shah and representatives of civil society also attended the workshop, organized by the Punjab CPB in association with Muslim Charity UK. Raja Basharat said that increase in the incidents of child sexual abuse in the last few years was a matter of concern, so it was welcome to hold this workshop on the causes of child sexual abuse and measures to prevent it. He said stricter laws were being introduced for perpetrators of sexual violence against children and women.

As per the Ordinance brought on the directive of Prime Minister Imran Khan, the harshest punishments had been laid down, he added.

He said that the earlier Zainab Alert law was also an important step of their government in this direction. Raja Basharat said the Punjab government had centralized the one-five call system for immediate police action. He said there were all laws in Pakistan but they were not implemented effectively. He lamented that the society created difficulties instead of facilities for the affected children and families.

The Law Minister said that parents, teachers, media and civil society should work together to eradicate this social evil.

He said that awareness of all including children, parents, teachers along with strict rules was very important. The recommendations of the workshop would definitely be incorporated in the new legislation, he assured.

Ejaz Alam Augustine suggested that awareness material on prevention of sexual abuse of children be included in the curriculum, while Sarah Ahmed said that certain Sections and clauses to protect the abused child and family should be included in new and old laws.

The days in which girls are supposed to play with dolls and boys with cars, their parents started to play their life. Why? Because this is exactly what which happened with them when they were children. This trend passes from one generation to another. Will it ever stop? If it is happening in 21st century then it can happen in coming centuries too.

Child marriage is not common among lower class people. I have heard that some people belonging to good class are trapped in this mind boggling act. So far no one is seeing any step from government to control this social issue. No one knows that will government be ever able to overcome this crime. I only know that child marriage destroys life specially affects the girl child’s life.

Sexual assault and rape are a few of the most difficult crimes to report and prosecute. Due to the evidentiary burden which is infamously difficult to prove, most sexual assault cases do not follow through to conviction. In Pakistan, social taboo and victim shaming further complicate the process of obtaining justice, leading to rape being one of the most underreported crimes in the country.

Yet slowly but surely, we are making progress. The parliament’s small amendments to the legislation pertaining to rape and honour crimes go a long way, as do the courts’ progressive interpretations. Recently, a Lahore High Court’s judgement assessing the use of non-sterile objects to collect evidence in sexual assault is a step towards rectifying the messy and often humiliating process of evidence collection in such cases.

That non-sterile objects be banned from use of evidence collection seems self-evident, yet unfortunately, this had been the custom for a long time. Doctors usually prepared swabs with non-sterile objects such as matchsticks, ice cream scoops, broomsticks and twigs and then used them to collect evidence from the victim. In some cases, large cotton plugs have been used as swabs. The use of such items can be dangerous, not to mention, humiliating for the victim. They are also not helpful, leading to contamination which can jeopardise the process of DNA analysis.

The LHC’s banning of such methods should hopefully ensure a more transparent, clean and welcoming medical response to victims of sexual assault. In a court system where DNA evidence is oftentimes only admitted as secondary evidence, it is of the utmost importance that the health departments at least practice the process with sensitivity and health standards. The social stigma of reporting rape and sexual assault is already enormous – additional hurdles such as poor medical evidence collection practices should be removed.",[],"Due to the evidentiary burden which is infamously difficult to prove, most sexual assault cases do not follow through to conviction.

A trial court in Rawalpindi has awarded the death sentence to Sohail Ayaz. The death penalty to the sexual predator is a small victory for the judiciary and society in general. The court of the Additional District and Sessions Judge Jehangir Ali Gondal deserves credit for not delaying the hearings and issuing a swift and appropriate judgement. However, it is also an unfortunate reality that the rot still runs too deep. Just today, police officials recovered the burnt body of a seven-year-old girl from a graveyard; she went missing two days ago.

The frequency with which our children experience sexual abuse indicates that we have a long way to go before succeeding in eradicating this menace. According to a recent report, “Cruel Number” published by Sahil, an NGO that works for child protection, on average, more than six children were abused daily in the first half of 2020. It is unfortunate noting that the tall claims that the government and authorities made after the heinous incident of Zainab are meaningless, and we are unable to put a stop to the sexual abuse of children. The report showed almost no positive change in numbers since 2018 and speaks volumes about the fault in our strategy to protect our children.

Before anything else, we must admit that there is no simple way forward to curb this menace. The solution needs to be a holistic one. First, the state must come up with legislation without loopholes. Strict laws enforced by better policing and more cops having sensitivity training about the menace will help in decreasing the occurrence of such mishaps. Second, there is an urgent need for initiating a public dialogue about the issue. Third, the national curriculum needs to be redesigned to educate children about the issue and its various forms. This way, the society and state by pointing out the faultlines and working together, can fix the problem of child abuse.",[],"The death penalty to the sexual predator is a small victory for the judiciary and society in general.

The road to criminalising domestic violence in Pakistan has been a long one. It has included much persuasion of more conservative parliamentarians and convincing religious-political parties that criminalising domestic violence does not go against religious confines.

The country has now taken a big step towards elimination of this social menace with the last remaining province, which did not have an anti-domestic violence law, also adopting legislation criminalising it. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly on Friday declared the abuse of women by family members an offence punishable with 1–5 years imprisonment along with a fine. Sindh was the first province where the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act, 2013, was passed in 2013. In Balochistan, the assembly had passed The Balochistan Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act, 2014, in 2014. In Punjab, the Punjab Protection of Women against Violence Act, 2016, was famously made law in February 2016. The only territory now left without protections against domestic violence is Islamabad, where the government has tabled similar laws this year but they have yet to be passed by the parliament.

This has not been easy—the bill was long delayed due to opposition from some political parties, particularly the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal (MMA), which had expressed reservations about certain provisions.

While this is a good step, it must be noted that the passed law is less progressive than the proposed drafts and from its counterparts in other provinces. There are several legal ambiguities—for example, domestic violence does not have an expansive definition. The definition of an aggrieved person is also limited—unlike its counterparts in Sindh and Balochistan, the KP law only uses the word “victim”, that too only to include women, not men or other genders. Perhaps most critically, the law does not cover protections for children, due to controversy over the definition of child, with some members objecting to persons under eighteen years of age included under child.

Despite the reservations, it is still a welcome first step towards improving the lives of disadvantaged groups in the country. It is hoped the law will be improved through amendments over time.",[],"Share:The road to criminalising domestic violence in Pakistan has been a long one.

The French Catholic Church on Friday adopted a resolution on a number of measures to fight church child abuse and take care of victims, including providing financial assistance to them in the wake of the results of an investigation into a series of paedophilia cases involving clergymen.

""We have decided on three packages of measures during our Plenary Assembly in March 2021. They form part of a general process intended to take a decisive step in the recognition of this violence and the fight against this abuse"", the Bishop's Conference said in a letter cited by the Catholic Church.

The first package includes measures regarding the Church's relation with the victims, including providing any kind of help to them — increase awareness on ways to support them, provide financial assistance, improve the education of priests and all pastoral leaders, especially those who will work with young people, among others.

The second set of measures aims at strengthening canonical justice procedures, which does not exclude resorting to public trial. In particular, a criminal court at the national level will be created to ensure the necessary means to operate efficiently.

""The [third package] of measures concerns the organization of the Bishops' Conference ... We will set up a service to 'step up vigilance and form the right pastoral relationship',"" the letter added.

The Bishops' Conference also expressed the Church's desire to assume its responsibility before society by asking pardon for these crimes and for these failures.

Earlier in March, the French Independent Commission on sexual abuse in the church set up by the Bishops' Conference of France in 2018 established following the inquiry that there might have been up to 10,000 victims since 1950 instead of previously estimated 3,000.",[],"Share:The French Catholic Church on Friday adopted a resolution on a number of measures to fight church child abuse and take care of victims, including providing financial assistance to them in the wake of the results of an investigation into a series of paedophilia cases involving clergymen.

HAFIZABAD - Different social, political workers and businessmen of Hafizabad district have strongly protested against the slackness of Jalalpur Bhattian Police for its failure in arresting the accused involved in the abduction of two sons of Akhtar Ali, one of them was sodomised and murdered while the other has not yet been traced.

They expressed their resentment over the rising incidents of child abuse in Jalalpur Bhattian area and the police apathy to prevent such incidents.

On Tuesday evening Ali Hamza (14) and his elder brother Zaman Akhtar son of Akhtar Ali of Mohallah Iqbalpur Jalalpur Bhattian went to the Bazar to purchase something when they were abducted by some fiendish youngmen.

The parents went from pillar to post to locate them for several hours and found the dead body of Ali Hamza lying in the nearby field in naked condition on Wednesday. Following this, hundreds of villagers gathered and blocked Pindi Bhattian road and staged demonstration to protest against the police. Several political workers and traders condemned the behaviour of the SHO. Even PTI leaders including MNA Ch.

The DPO suspended the SHO immediately and constituted two special teams to arrest the accused and to trace Zaman Akhtar within 24 hours but the police had neither arrested any of the accused nor traced Zaman Akhtar.

According to official figures, eleven cases of child abuse were registered in Jalalpur Bhattian Police station during the past two-and-a-half month which was cause of concern of the inhabitants. They had demanded immediate arrest of the accused and locate Zaman Akhtar.

Taipei-A Singaporean couple who allegedly dumped a newborn baby in the trash during a trip to Taiwan two years ago have been placed on the island’s wanted list on suspicion of murder, prosecutors said Wednesday.

The couple allegedly left the baby girl with placenta and umbilical cord still attached in a recycling bin in February 2019. A recycling company employee later found the girl’s body wrapped in a garbage bag.

Prosecutors told AFP that Li Heng Xun, 25, and Evon Yee, 26, are now both being sought for murder and a charge of abandonment. But Taiwan sometimes faces difficulties in pressing extradition requests because many countries do not treat it as a sovereign nation, especially those with close links to China. On Wednesday, Taiwan’s Apple Daily reported that Singaporean authorities had refused multiple requests to provide the couple’s DNA samples citing “inconvenience due to the coronavirus pandemic”. Prosecutors declined to comment on that report when contacted by AFP. The case bears some resemblance to a Hong Kong man who is wanted in Taiwan for the murder of his pregnant girlfriend.

Chan Tong-kai has admitted to killing his girlfriend in a Taipei hotel room during a Valentines holiday to the city in February 2018. Currently in Hong Kong, he has expressed willingness to surrender himself. But he remains free as Taiwan and Hong Kong argue over the handling of his case.

That murder inadvertently led to the huge democracy protests that swept through Hong Kong in 2019 over a now-scrapped bill to allow extraditions to China, which regards Taiwan as part of its territory.

Taiwanese media reported that the Singaporean couple are believed to have dumped the girl’s body seven days after they arrived in Taiwan. They then flew back to Singapore the same day.

Local media have aired CCTV footage of a man carrying a black plastic bag walking in an alley and a pregnant woman in a convenience store, identifying them as the two Singaporeans.

Police reportedly found blood trace in the bathroom of their hotel room that matched the baby’s.",[],"Share:Taipei-A Singaporean couple who allegedly dumped a newborn baby in the trash during a trip to Taiwan two years ago have been placed on the island’s wanted list on suspicion of murder, prosecutors said Wednesday.

Violence against women is considered as normal practice in our patriarchal society.

Irrespective of their class, education and social status in society, women are often seen in subordinate roles. They are taught to be submissive and inferior beings.

Both men and women can be victims of violence, however, women are more vulnerable due their positions within the home, at workplace and in society.

Violence is any act or threat that result in suffering for women. This violence can be physical, sexual, economic and mental in nature.

History tells us that women’ bodies have been objectified as a ground for wars. Women have faced oppression since the beginning of age. Over the years the common practice of Patriarchy has become deep rooted with creating a mindset that strongly see women as a problem to society and a threat to male dominancy.

HomeNet Pakistan (HNP) aims to work towards sustainable development goal, achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.

HomeNet envisions a society in which home based workers are ensured visibility, recognition, legal and social protection, and a decent standard of living. HNP shares stories of home based workers’ gender based violence and resilience.

Fouzia was married at a tender age without her will. Carrying orthodox mentality of early child marriage, her mother forced her into an arranged marriage. Her in-laws detested her presence and to them, she was a maid for their house.

Socialized to be a submissive woman like many others in our society, Fouzia never raised her brows on her ill-behaved in-laws. When Fouzia gave birth to her first child, a daughter, she was being verbally abused by in-laws as bearer of “solely daughters”.

Behavior of her in-laws worsened upon birth of her second daughter. She tolerated the abuse for the sake of her family and to protect their honor as divorce is associated with stigma for a woman. She thought that things will change as later she gave birth to a son, but soon her husband planned to go to Dubai for job, leaving her behind with his cruel mother, his sister and her husband.

Aware of the lecherous acts of her male in-laws, Fouzia demanded her husband to shift her in a new house as she wasn’t comfortable with her male in-laws alone in his absence. Her husband refused to fulfil any such demands.

Fouzia was more worried about her daughters than herself. All her pleas were disregarded by her husband which led her to take a strong decision to file for divorce. Unconcerned for her children, her husband agreed and fled to Dubai leaving Fouzia and 3 children behind.

Having dexterity in stitching and stone work Fouzia started as a home based worker to earn for her children.

She was introduced to HomeNet Pakistan by HNP’ social mobilizer. Soon Fouzia became a member of HNP and attended numerous trainings to empower herself socially and economically.

Among these trainings were financial literacy, leadership, ecommerce, 3-day capacity building, group formation, business development, digital literacy and training of trainers. With the help of these trainings, Fouzia was able to gain bargaining skills, communication skills, costing and soon she formed her own group of 50 women home workers.

Initially Fouzia used to work for someone but with progress in work, she started getting work in bulk, enough to provide to her own group of workers.

She further attended the awareness sessions of HNP that included, awareness on HBWs law, study circle on early child marriage, Violence against women and exposure visits to market and women development department.

The exposure visits acquainted her with the knowledge of various products and their worth in market, as well as, knowledge of women’ right. 95% of women home based workers are unaware of their rights as a women and thus end up becoming an easy victim of gender discrimination.

Upon consulting the advocate through the exposure visit, arranged by HNP, Fouzia received guidance and soon filed a case against her husband for maintenance of their children. Fouzia believed she could’ve done this early but she was unaware of her rights and laws for women. She was at a stage where she begged her husband to stay and now she has empowered and become economically independent that her ex-husband wants to reunite with her.

Fouzia believes she is much better off now and she will not sacrifice her peace for any further gender based violence.

Naseem, another woman who became victim of violence, among many others. She married at an early age with a guy who was her extended relative. Her family was unaware that her husband was a drug addict. She was deceived into marriage as her in-laws kept it hidden.

Naseem, who was educated till college was married off to a completely uneducated guy from a village. Despite the fact that he was illiterate, Naseem’ family gave her daughter. When her family was informed about his drug addiction, they didn’t bother to free their daughter from him, in order to keep the family’ honor.

Drug addiction of her husband came to her as a shock after the birth of her first child. Naseem faced verbal abuse and physical abuse at the hands of her husband daily.

When she informed her parents, they discarded her plea for help as something nugatory, indicating that this is what every woman face as a norm in society, thus, Naseem should also tolerate. Her family cared more about disturbance and rivalries in relation with extended family, rather than violence that their daughter was facing. Naseem accepted that ‘suffering’ was her fate.

Since her husband wouldn’t earn money, she started working since the beginning of her marriage. Her husband would snatchall her earnings to fulfil his desire and craving for drugs.

With evident misbehavior of her husband, her mother-in-law didn’t leave a chance to mistreat her. Aware of her husband’ behavior she took every advantage to torture Naseem. Since her husband wouldn’t earn money and provide for family’ need, Naseem, who had studied till college, was forced to start work as a domestic worker as there was no other job for her in village. Later, due to severe drug intake, her husband passed away.

Upon death of her husband, she wanted to come back to Karachi but her own parents weren’t willing to take her as her mother-in-law showed willingness to keep her, but little did she know about her intentions. Within two months her mother-in-law started abusing her and wouldn’t provide her food to eat.

She ran away from village with her children and came to her parent’s house where she currently resides and earn for her 2 kids. She started work as a teacher but income was very less.

Later she worked in survey, but that job was also short lived. She learned stitching and stone work on her own.

After sometime, she attended trainings of HomeNet Pakistan, where she was introduced by social mobilizer.

Upon receiving guidance from HomeNet Pakistan, she was linked with a social welfare organization that provides her monthly ration. Slowly and gradually, as a home based worker, she is able to earn enough for her children.

Although, her earnings are not enough to do monthly savings but she earns enough to fulfill her basic needs.",['Web Desk'],"Both men and women can be victims of violence, however, women are more vulnerable due their positions within the home, at workplace and in society.

US State Secretary Mike Pompeo denounced China Monday following the reports that Beijing forces birth control on Uighurs to suppress their population.

""The world received disturbing reports today that the Chinese Communist Party [CCP] is using forced sterilization, forced abortion, and coercive family planning against Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang, as part of a continuing campaign of repression,"" Pompeo denounced in a statement.

He said German researcher Adrian Zenz's ""shocking revelations are sadly consistent with decades of CCP practices that demonstrate an utter disregard for the sanctity of human life and basic human dignity.""

Pompeo urged Beijing to immediately end ""these horrific practices"" and asked all nations to join the US in demanding an end to ""these dehumanizing abuses.""

The 32-page report penned by Zenz and revealed Saturday is based on a research carried out in 2017-2018 which brought to light the Chinese government's campaign of repression and mass internment directed against ethnic Uighur people in Xinjiang.

China's Foreign Ministry rejected the claims by saying the government treats all ethnicities equally and called the report ""fabricated"".

Xinjiang region is home to around 10 million Uighurs. The Turkic Muslim group, which makes up around 45% of Xinjiang’s population, has long accused China's authorities of cultural, religious and economic discrimination.

Up to 1 million people, or about 7% of the Muslim population in Xinjiang, have been incarcerated in an expanding network of ""political re-education"" camps, according to US officials and UN experts.",[],"Share:US State Secretary Mike Pompeo denounced China Monday following the reports that Beijing forces birth control on Uighurs to suppress their population.

It seems like the government is set to pass some of the most sweeping reforms to anti-rape laws—the Law Minister has confirmed that the parliament will soon promulgate an ordinance to introduce strict punishments for rapists and sex offenders including the death penalty and chemical castration. Several other important amendments are also being made, including expanding the definition of rape and prohibiting the controversial “two-finger” test.

The events of the previous year had made some legislative change absolutely necessary. Rape incident after rape incident had alarmed the public, with the lack of action and the victim-blaming attitude of some security officials generating negative attention for the government.

Some of the proposed provisions could go a long way in changing the way that rape is perceived in the country. More helpful than the introduction of the death penalty and castration, is the expansion of the definition of rape, which was severely lacking in previous laws. The new definition has been expanded to make the victim gender-neutral and has included other acts in addition to intercourse that constitute rape. This change is crucial—it now allows male children and members of the transgender community and other gender minorities to seek refuge under this law. However, there are some disturbing aspects of the legislation as well—it seems the age of consent has been needlessly lowered from sixteen to thirteen, a change which does not make sense considering the prevalence of sexual crimes against children and the incidents of child brides.

Nevertheless, the amendments introduced are a step in the right direction and hold great impact—it is a pity then that the government is including them in an ordinance rather than passing it as a bill in parliament, meaning that it will soon lapse. There is no political sense to it—this is an issue all parties are on board with. For laws like these to serve as a deterrent to a horrific crime, they need to be certain and set in stone—an ordinance is not the best way.",[],"Share:It seems like the government is set to pass some of the most sweeping reforms to anti-rape laws—the Law Minister has confirmed that the parliament will soon promulgate an ordinance to introduce strict punishments for rapists and sex offenders including the death penalty and chemical castration.

In a society where crimes against women are often neglected, it is the job of the media to report rape cases responsibly and with utmost priority so that it receives a sense of outrage, that it inculcates a feeling amongst the masses that such a crime should never be allowed to be committed again, and it invokes pressure on the government to pass laws to prevent and erase the rape culture that exists.

It is important to remember however that there is a big difference between reporting details of a rape case to foster a national call of accountability, and sensationalising brutal details of the case for ratings and quick publicity.

The details of the Kashmore rape case are absolutely horrifying. The rape of a woman and her minor daughter should cause public revulsion on an unprecedented scale. While it should be reported on thoroughly, the media and the public should also be cognisant of the fact that the victims have gone through an unimaginably heinous and harrowing experience, and should be dealt with the utmost sensitivity and empathy.

Unfortunately, as we have seen in previous rape cases, this case too has been sensationalised in ways that overstep journalistic ethics. Videos of the victims, including the minor, showing their faces and scars, are being circulated around social media. Quickly produced writings and articles are being published which use incorrect terminology, stating that an “incident occurred”, rather than reporting that a “rape” has been “committed”. Phrases like “committed rape with her” are inaccurate and deeply inappropriate, since they appear victim-blaming.

The most important priority after such a case is to prosecute the culprit and protect the victims. In these circumstances, the victims are rarely in a mental state to give consent to their identities and faces being plastered on videos and news stories. The law protects the identities of rape victims, particularly minors. It is hoped that the media, and the public, express outrage and demand accountability, but do so in a way that protects the victims and their privacy, is sensitive to their trauma, and does not discourage other victims from coming forward.",[],"It is important to remember however that there is a big difference between reporting details of a rape case to foster a national call of accountability, and sensationalising brutal details of the case for ratings and quick publicity.

LAHORE - The prime suspect of the Lahore-Sialkot motorway gang-rape case Abid Malhi was arrested by the city police on Monday.

Prime Minister’s Special Assistant Shahbaz Gill confirmed the arrest in a tweet and said that the suspect would be punished according to law. Last month, two robbers on the Lahore-Sialkot motorway had gang-raped a mother of two in front of her children within the Gujjarpura police jurisdiction.

Police sources say Abid was arrested from Faisalabad and shifted to Lahore amid tight security. The arrest comes weeks after the incident that sparked outrage across the country. The horrific incident caused a countrywide outpouring of anger and brought sexual violence against women into national focus once again. Abid and Shafqat Ali alias Bagga, who is on judicial remand, are said to be the main suspects in this case.

Abid was leading a gang of four and wanted to police in at least 10 other criminal cases registered at various police stations of Punjab.

The news was welcomed by President Arif Alvi, who termed the arrest “a matter of national relief.”

“An efficient trial of the accused and the ‘severest exemplary’ punishment possible under the law must be given to all those found guilty,” the president said in a tweet on Monday. “Let everyone feel safe in Pakistan, specially our women and children.”

Shafqat, whose arrest was announced by Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, was sent to prison on a 14-day judicial remand by an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore a day after he was detained by the police.

Shafqat was detained by police after the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Police raided a house in Okara district. He confessed to the crime before his DNA matched the samples collected from the crime scene.

The CTD had carried out an intelligence-based operation (IBO) and arrested Shafqat from his sister’s house in Depalpur. Abid had called Shafqat many times before and after committing the rape.

During interrogation, Shafqat told police investigators that Abid had first raped the woman and then asked him to commit the offence while threatening him that he would shoot him (Shafqat) for not committing the crime or showing sympathy for the victim.",['Our Staff Reporter'],"Share:LAHORE - The prime suspect of the Lahore-Sialkot motorway gang-rape case Abid Malhi was arrested by the city police on Monday.

ISLAMABAD - Chairman Kashmir Committee Shehryar Khan Afridi on Monday said that Indian occupational forces were waging a ‘rape war’ using rape as tool of genocide against the freedom loving Kashmiris in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and the failure of world community in punishing the culprits of Kupwara mass rapes may lead to eruption of a new war between two nuclear neighbours.

He expressed these views while addressing the participants of a seminar titled ‘Mass rapes’ by occupational forces of India in Kunan Poshpora, Kupwara, Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir on February 23, 1991. The event was held under the auspices of Islamabad Institute of Conflict Resolution (ISCR) in liaison with Embassy of Azerbaijan.

Afridi said that until recently, there existed no punishment for ‘war rape’ in international law.

“War crimes or humanitarian law specifically focuses on the treatment of the civilian population and ‘any devastation not justified by military necessity.’ Thereafter, war rape has rarely been prosecuted as a war crime. Since 1949 Article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention explicitly prohibits wartime rape and enforced prostitution. The United Nations and the prosperous world needs to take steps to protect the weak and unprotected segments of society, Afridi said”

He said that repeated incidents of massacres and genocide reflected that the world had failed to protect the oppressed people living in conflict zones as “might is right prevails.”

Shehryar Afridi said that the mass rapes of women in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and Khojaly, Nagorno-Karabakh had been used by occupational forces as tool of genocide.

“Kunan Poshpora in Kupwara is the most scenic area of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir but the mass rapes of 1991 have left scars in the minds of the people of Kashmir,” he said. He said that expansionist designs of India were a threat to world peace and if the world failed to bring resolution to conflict zones like Jammu and Kashmir, no one could rule out possibility of a new war erupting between Pakistan and India.

“Any new war may suck in other nuclear powers of the region. Hence, this conflict may not remain limited,” warned Afridi.

He said that India was being ruled by a fascist regime of Narendra Modi who believed in Hindu supremacist ideology and all minorities in India were under a threat of genocide.

He said that unfortunately, rape was also used as a tool of punishment in conflict zones and history suggested that this one element of violence was used as an effective weapon and strategy for disarming psychological war. “This weapon of rape was used by many combatants and this global issue has no national boundaries of ideology or religion.”

He said it was more of associated with masculine identity commonly but in war times there was often violation of men and children too through different means of torture and distress.

“Therefore, it often does not remain gender bound but women being soft target are more of victim of rape in war precincts. There are many examples of such mass rapes during conflicts and war times during Rawanda genocide, Bosnia & Kosovo conflicts, Khojaly massacre by Armenian forces in Azerbaijan and not to forget Kashmir where such incidents occur frequently to suppress freedom movement,” he added.

Afridi said that in Kashmiri history, mass rape incident ensued in area of Kunan Poshpora in February 1991 and social stigma generated out of this incident was that women still faced difficulties in getting married.

He said that South Asian subcontinent was the least gender sensitive region in the world. It was the only region in the world where men outnumber women.

Azerbaijan Ambassador Ali Alizade highlighted the genocide perpetrated by the Armenian army in Nagorno-Karabakh area of Khojaly and said that the occupational forces committed massive killings to suppress the voices against freedom of Nagorno-Karabakh.

He said that despite United Nations Security Council resolutions, the world community failed to help the oppressed people of Nagorno-Karabakh.

He also urged the United Nations to hold plebiscite in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir as enshrined in the United Nations Security Council resolutions.

Islamabad-The 23-year-old girl Kainat Tariq, who was studying at a university, was not murdered but committed suicide by swallowing poisonous pills, police investigators have concluded.

The motive behind the suicide committed by Kainat Tariq, also employee of Red Crescent Society Pakistan, was separation between her parents.

Following a deep investigation into the case, the investigators concluded, “it was a suicide case,” said a senior police officer while talking to The Nation on Saturday.

It may be noted that Industrial Area police have arrested former Secretary General of RCSP Khalid Bin Majeed after Muhammad Tariq Khan, the father of deceased, accused him of contracting “secret marriage” and murdering her by giving her poison.

Police had also obtained five-day physical remand of the accused from a court of law.

Sharing further details, the senior police officer, who is enjoying a good repute in Islamabad police, said the investigators have collected all the evidences in the case.

He said Kainat Tariq was mentally disturbed due to clash between her father and mother, who had separated. He added on the day of incident, Kainat Tariq bought anti-rat pills from a medical store situated at Taramari Chowk while she was being transported to her office from home by a staff driver of RSCP. “The girl swallowed pills in the vehicle and her condition started deteriorating in office when she called Khalid Bin Majeed, her ultimate boss,” he said adding that Khalid immediately brought her to RCSP Hospital for medical treatment but the doctors referred her to Holy Family Hospital (HFH) due to critical condition. “In HFH, the doctors washed her stomach but she could not survive,” the police officer said.

Police had also seized the empty bottle of pills and bill of medical store from office of girl besides grilling the medical store owner who admitted that Kainat purchased pills from him, he said.

He added police had taken samples from the body of deceased and dispatched to Forensic Lab Lahore for examination.

He said Khalid Bin Majeed is not a killer rather he was taking care of his employee (Kainat) and was her sympathiser because of her “disturbed home life.”

“Kainat was living in a hostel along with two other friends. The police also questioned the management of hostel,” he said.

On a query, the police officer said Kainat was not married to Khalid Bin Majeed as police could not get any marriage certificate (Nikkah Nama) or any other evidence in this regard so far. “Her salary was Rs35,000 and not that much mentioned by her father in FIR,” he said in response to another query.

Another beyond-horrific incident of sexual violence has been reported—Charsadda police have revealed that they found the body of a two-and-a-half-year-old girl Zainab, in the Jabba Korona area in the limits of Daudzai police station of Peshawar on Wednesday. She appeared to have been assaulted and tortured before being killed.

There are hardly any words to capture how heartbreaking this incident is. The incident draws striking similarity to the 2018 rape and murder of 8-year-old Zainab Amin in Kasur, a case where another girl child was reported missing and then found dead with evidence of sexual assault. Despite the huge outcry the 2018 case had caused, it seems unfortunate that Pakistan is still an unsafe place for women and children. Hundreds of similar incidents occur every month, a few catch national attention and outrage, a few laws which are not implemented properly or seem to not have an impact are passed, and the public sentiment is one of executing the culprits, rather than mapping out long-term ways to make the streets safer for women.

Perhaps it is time for the government to sort out its priorities. For now, it seems more focused on moral posturing- needlessly banning and censoring any media it deems “immoral”, even when that media is showcasing just women doing normal activities. Women taking a part in public life is not immoral and should not be censored—indeed, doing so can further encourage the harassment of women. Stricter punishments, which seems to be the government’s easy way out, can only work if the perpetrators are caught. So far, the Lahore Police have been unable to catch the prime suspects in the month-old Lahore-Sialkot Motorway rape case. More action is needed by the government, which needs to step up and show that it is a government for the women of this country as well as the men.",[],"The incident draws striking similarity to the 2018 rape and murder of 8-year-old Zainab Amin in Kasur, a case where another girl child was reported missing and then found dead with evidence of sexual assault.

ISLAMABAD - The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Friday said that the Holy Quran also does not mandate the punishment of death for the offence of adultery, and if a man suspects his wife of infidelity he should follow the path prescribed by the Holy Quran and the law of Pakistan.

A two-member bench of the apex court comprising Justice Qazi Faez Isa and Justice Sardar Tariq Masood gave these findings in a judgment of a murder case.

A petitioner Muhammad Abbas had killed his wife Mst Saima Bibi stating that she was woman of bad character. Sessions Judge Nankana Sahib awarded petitioner death sentence under Section 302(b) of Pakistan Penal Code.

Abbas challenged the sentence in Lahore High Court (LHC) which upheld his conviction, but reduced his death sentence to life imprisonment.

The petitioner then approached Supreme Court against the LHC verdict. The apex court ,however, dismissed his petition.

The verdict authored by Justice Qazi Faez Isa said that the woman or the girl who is killed in the name or pretext of honour has no chance to redeem her honour. She is deprived of both her life and reputation.

He wrote that the petitioner who professes to be a Muslim did not follow the methodology commanded by Almighty Allah and the law of Pakistan to resolve his suspicions about his wife.

The verdict said that the petitioner then couched his criminal and un-Islamic conduct by stating that he became enraged to see his wife in the company of a man and on account of his ‘ghairat’ he killed her.

“Almighty Allah loves those who amongst others restrain their anger. To become enraged is not an admirable trait nor is ghairat,” said the apex court’s verdict.

The top court of the country noted that Pakistan has one of the highest, if not the highest per capita honour killings in the world and predominantly the victims are women.

The judgment said that by stating that murder was committed on the pretext of ghairat (honour) the murderer hopes to provide some justification for the crime.

It may also elevate the murderer’s social status with those not familiar with what Almighty Allah Commands in the Holy Quran. This is unfortunate, more so because there is no honour in such killings.

Justice Qazi wrote that Parliament was rightly concerned with the prevalence of such killings and enacted legislation to dissuade, if not stop such crimes. It did so by ensuring that offenders do not avail of the benefit of section 302(c) PPC, for which the maximum punishment is 25 years imprisonment but which does not prescribe a minimum punishment.

Parliament specifically stipulated that such crimes attract clause (a) or clause (b) of section 302 PPC, for which the punishment is either death or imprisonment for life, he added.

He said that according to Principle of Policy set out in the Constitution; “The State shall protect the marriage, the family, the mother and the child’.

When women and girls are not protected but rather killed in the name or on the pretext of honour the family is destroyed, he added.

According to the judgment, the two concurrent findings of guilt against the petitioner by the Sessions Judge and LHC are supported by evidence on record which the apex court also independently examined.

There is no reason justifying the grant of leave, which is declined, and, consequently, the petition is dismissed, added the judgment.",['Shahid Rao'],"Share:ISLAMABAD - The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Friday said that the Holy Quran also does not mandate the punishment of death for the offence of adultery, and if a man suspects his wife of infidelity he should follow the path prescribed by the Holy Quran and the law of Pakistan.

Expressing concern over persistent reports of serious human rights violations and abuses in Ethiopia's Tigray region, the UN human rights chief said Thursday there is an urgent need for an objective and independent assessment of facts on the ground.

Michelle Bachelet, the high commissioner for human rights, said her office had received information about ongoing fighting across the region, particularly in the center of Tigray region, as well as incidents of looting by ""various armed actors.""

""Deeply distressing reports of sexual and gender-based violence, extrajudicial killings, widespread destruction and looting of public and private property by all parties continue to be shared with us, as well as reports of continued fighting in central Tigray in particular,"" said Bachelet in a statement.

""Credible information also continues to emerge about serious violations of international human rights law and humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict in Tigray in November last year.""

She said that without prompt, impartial, and transparent investigations and holding those responsible accountable, she feared violations would continue ""with impunity,"" and the situation will remain volatile for a long time.

The rights office said it has information about the killing of eight protestors by security forces on Feb. 9-10 in Adigrat, Mekelle, Shire, and Wukro.

Sexual violence

More than 136 cases of rape have also been reported in hospitals in Mekelle, Ayder, Adigrat, and Wukro in the east of the Tigray region between December and January, said the office.

It said there are indications that there are many more such unreported cases.

""The government has said investigations are underway into the cases of sexual violence,"" said the rights office, adding it had information about indiscriminate shelling in the Tigray towns of Mekelle, Humera, and Adigrat in November.

It also had reports of grave human rights violations and abuses, including mass killings by armed forces from the neighboring country of Eritrea in Axum and Dengelat in central Tigray.

""A preliminary analysis of the information received indicates that serious violations of international law, possibly amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity, may have been committed by multiple actors in the conflict,"" said the office.

These include the Ethiopian National Defense Forces, the Tigray People's Liberation Front, Eritrean armed forces, and Amhara regional forces and affiliated militia.

""With multiple actors in the conflict, blanket denials, and finger-pointing, there is a clear need for an objective, independent assessment of these reports – victims and survivors of these violations must not be denied their rights to the truth and justice,"" said Bachelet.

""We urge the government of Ethiopia to grant my office, and other independent monitors access to the Tigray region, with a view to establishing the facts and contributing to accountability, regardless of the affiliation of perpetrators,"" she said.

Threat to journalists

The UN rights chief also expressed concern at detentions this week in Tigray of journalists and translators working for local and international media.

While the journalists have been released, the office said there have been worrying remarks by a government official that those responsible for ""misleading international media"" would be held accountable.

The Tigray region has been the scene of fighting since November when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced military operations against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), who he accused of attacking federal army camps.

Reports are circulating that a former staffer of Joe Biden is accusing the Democratic presidential candidate of sexual assault in the 1990s.

Former Senate staffer Tara Reade had previously accused the candidate of unwanted physical touching but recently filed a report saying Biden sexually assaulted her.

“Please Republicans do not use my assault for political gain. Help me pressure [media outlets] to question Joe Biden,” Reade tweeted a day before the Associated Press released a report about the alleged sexual assault.

Reade was one of eight women who came forward last year and accused the presidential hopeful of inappropriate touching. The candidate later apologized and said he’d be more mindful about personal space.

The former staffer had accused Biden of inappropriate actions, like massaging her neck and playing with her hair. Now, news outlets are reporting that she filed a police report in Washington about an alleged sexual assault that occurred in 1993.

She told the Associated Press that he pushed her against the wall and penetrated her with his finger.

On 7 February 2020, the national assembly of Pakistan passed a resolution calling for public hanging of child molesters. While the resolution was non-binding, meant for further debate and discussion only, it was met with sharp criticism. Those opposing the resolution included some members of the ruling party itself led by its federal Minister for human rights. Another federal Minister took to twitter asserting ‘this is just another grave act in line with brutal civilisation practices, societies act in a balanced way barbarianism is not an answer to crimes...... this is another expression of extremism’. Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, a national assembly member of PPP, stated, ‘we cannot put public hanging into practice. It violates the laws of the United Nations’. Likewise, condemnation also came from human rights bodies, particularly Amnesty international that rarely let go of any opportunity to remind Pakistan of its international obligation to abolish the death penalty under an optional protocol of ICCPR 1966. One human rights expert went on to claim that there is no empirical evidence to show that public hangings are a deterrent to crime or in protecting the psychosocial well being of children.

Admittedly, the issue of the death penalty for child molesters has been contentious, it would be over-simplistic to suggest that public hanging of such persons would make Pakistan a laughing stock in the world community and the country would violate its international commitments by doing this. The learned ministers and rights activists need to be reminded that Pakistan is a signatory to the UN Convention on Rights of the Child 1989 which obliges it to take effective measures to protect children against any kind of abuse. What steps have we taken so far to fulfil this duty? As to the claim of the lack of empirical evidence, one can reply that neither is there any empirical evidence to indicate public hanging would not be a deterrent to the crime.

Another way to interpret the non-binding resolution can be that the people of Pakistan have been outraged by a rising tide of child molestation and have come to a shared understanding, through their chosen representatives that further debate and discussion should take place to recommend appropriate measures to curb this ghastly crime. In response to the uproar against the resolution, suffice is to say that every country has its own social needs and indigenous circumstances which have to be kept in view while deciding what kind of punishment would be best suited to discourage a particular kind of criminality. Thus, for example, internal laws of at least three US states, of Louisiana, Texas and Montana provide the death penalty for the crime of child molestation. Similarly, India has enacted ‘The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012’ giving the death penalty to child rapists through speedy trial in special courts constituted for this purpose. In the same vein, China has a zero-tolerance policy towards child molestation and those who sexually abuse children and cause irreparable harm are destined to face the death penalty as required by Chinese law. These countries, while passing their internal laws, did not pay much heed to international outcry; by contrast, they considered what punishments would be best fitted to prevent the crime in their local conditions.

Everywhere in the world child molestation is regarded as a horrendous crime warranting rigorous measures for its control. This is so because the victim being a child is weak and vulnerable, and the trauma he/she experiences while going through abuse stays with him/her forever. Noticeably, there have been instances of people having nightmares even at the age of 60-70 years, of sexual abuse taken place in their childhood. Thus, states not affording the death penalty at least guarantee stricter punishments to repeat offenders, perpetrators, who victimise multiple children, and who stood in a position of trust concerning their victims. For example, states of Washington and Kansas passed so-called Sexual Predator Laws allowing offenders to be committed to mental institutions indefinitely after they have served their prison terms.

Psychologists believe that ‘paedophilia’ is a result of severe mental disorder and much like alcoholism, it cannot be ensured that the behaviour would not be repeated unless cured by sustained treatment. This mental illness can be treated either by ‘cognitive therapy’ or ‘chemical castration’ while cognitive therapy change sex offenders’ understanding of what they do and chemical castration eliminates the psychological cause of the urge. If these arrangements are available in your country, then, of course, the alternative punishments can be a more appropriate response to the crime. On the other hand, if your state does not have these facilities what option you are left with to deal with the criminality apart from deterrence. Of course, the modalities of deterrence could be discussed, debated upon and adapted, for instance, public hanging may not always be justifiable but this does not mean the seriousness of the offence can be denied because of the possible backlash of the international community.

Pakistan’s current legal regime protecting children against violence, exploitation and sexual abuse is inadequate, to say the least. Formerly, we had laws against sodomy or murder only, but in 2016 we enacted laws criminalising exploitation, abuse, trafficking etc. In January 2020, the parliament passed Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Act 2020 which aims to protect and raise an alert when a child goes missing or is abducted; the Act applies to Islamabad Capital Territory only.

The effectiveness of these laws is as yet to be tested. On a social level, it is thought to be a taboo in Pakistan to educate your child about sanctity and inviolability of his or her body. Use of forensics in criminal investigations is almost non-existent as per the statement of a former Chief Justice of Pakistan, and reporting of crimes is stigmatised, making it nearly impossible to prove the charge.

Under these circumstances, not having deterrent punishment can give a free license to paedophiles and sexual predators to implement their sinister designs without fear of consequences. If anyone has any alternative such as ‘cognitive therapy’ or ‘chemical castration’ they are more than welcome to take part in the on-going debate. However, silencing the discussion which reflects the consensus of the society to deal sternly with something so despicable, and that too under the apprehension of international fury would be nothing short of a tragedy.",['Dr Usman Hameed'],"Share:On 7 February 2020, the national assembly of Pakistan passed a resolution calling for public hanging of child molesters.

Rawalpindi-A woman along with her relatives and other accomplices allegedly burnt her husband to death in limits of Police Station (PS) Wah Cantt.

Police registered a murder case against the woman, her father, aunt and other unknown accomplices on complaint of mother of the deceased who was identified as Ahsan Iqbal.

According to details, Irshad Begum, mother of deceased, lodged complaint with PS Wah Cantt stating that her son Ahsan Iqbal had a court marriage with Aneeqa Bibi and the couple had a baby girl. She added her son started living with his wife in Bahria Town after she told him that she could not live with his parents.

She told her son died at Holy Family Hospital (HFH) due to burn injuries. The applicant asked police to register case against the killers and to arrest them. Police filed a case and started investigation Meanwhile, police have solved three murder cases and arrested five killers, informed a police spokesman.

There is no way to put into words the grief, horror and anger that people of Pakistan feel at the indescribable rape of a woman, on the motorway in Lahore, witnessed by her kids. Depressingly, just a few days before this heart-wrenching incident, a five-year old girl, Marwah, was raped, then hit on the head with a brick, and finally set on fire. And yet, the law enforcement agencies of Pakistan continue to function in their callous silos, doing only as much as is necessary to show some ‘action’ to the media eye. And, if history is any indication of State conduct, our fast-paced media cycle will soon pass these events into memory, without there have been any institutional reform or legislative action to bring about fundamental changes for the protection of women and children.

No one should be allowed to argue that these events—especially the rape and murder of Marwah—is an isolated event in our societal quagmire. In 2019, according to Sahil—an NGO working for the protection of children from violence—a total of 2,846 cases of child sexual abuse were reported in newspapers. That averages to almost 8 cases a day! And these are just the ones reported in the newspapers. One can only imagine what the actual numbers are.

Still, no institutional conscience was not jolted. No political party or State machinery sprang into action. As a result, the average number of daily child sexual abuse cases reported in Pakistan increased in the first half of 2020. According to Sahil’s latest report—based on data from 84 newspapers, covering incidents from all four provinces, as well as Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan—as of June 2020, some 497 child sexual abuse cases have been reported in the newspapers. A majority of these cases, almost 57 percent, were reported in Punjab. Of the rest, 32 percent were reported in Sindh, and 6 percent in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Sahil’s latest report also reveals that more than 35 child sexual abuse cases have been reported in Islamabad during this time, another 22 have been reported in Balochistan, 10 in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and one in Gilgit-Baltistan.

Sahil’s report reveals that girls are more vulnerable to child sexual abuse than boys, in the age brackets of up to 5 years and 16-18 years; however, boys were found to be more vulnerable to sexual abuse in the age brackets of 6-10 years and 11-15 years.

Out of the total reported cases, 62 percent were from rural areas and 38 percent reported from urban areas. Of these, 53 percent were girls and 47 percent boys. At least 173 children were gang-raped, whereas there were 227 reports of attempted sexual assault. And, if all this was not enough to rupture your heart, 38 children were killed during this time, after they had been sexually abused.

This deplorable state of affairs can be attributed to a number of societal and legal issues, including cultural deprecation, porous investigative structure, and a broken judicial system. And over the past several years—especially since the heart-wrenching event of Zainab’s murder in Kasur—none of these have undergone any meaningful reform or improvement. And, as a result, a number of culprits of these heinous crimes are repeat offenders, who have been emboldened by a State structure that just doesn’t care for making institutional improvements.

As an example, on Saturday night, when Punjab government announced that its investigation had short-listed two suspects of the Motoway gangrape incidence (with more than 90 percent scientific certainty), it was revealed that the primary accused (one Abid Ali) had faced charges of sexually molesting a women and her daughter, back in 2013, in Bhawalnagar. Yet, predictably, he was released by our investigative and judicial system, making him bolder to doing even more gruesome crimes. Inexplicably, our system of governance has no mechanism for keeping a track of such individuals. The siloed police structure has no system of tracking such culprits across the various jurisdictions of thanas and districts. And so, after Abid Ali committed such a crime in Bhawalnagar, he simply shifted cities, came to Sheikhupura and Lahore, where he had no past criminal record, and thus no reason for the local police to keep a track of his activities.

This is not the only instance of a repeat offender. Last year, when a child-pornography and racketeering gang was caught from KPK, it was discovered that its leader had earlier been convicted for sodomy related offences, and deported on such grounds from Scandinavia. Yet, our law enforcement agencies kept no record of the same, and found no reason to keep further track of his activities.

This is inexcusable. Worse, it is criminal, on part of the State.

Naturally, this has resulted in public outcry and deserved backlash. The public mayhem and vigilante protests, being witnessed across the streets of Pakistan, are not simply the reaction to any one murder. They are the outcry of a people who have suffered the injustice of our political and administrative reality for too long. They are not just protesting against the Motorway rape, or Marwah alone. They are protesting for Zainab also. They are clamouring for the fourteen martyrs of Model Town, for Shahzeb Khan, for Qandeel Baloch, for the police constable in Quetta who was killed by Abdul Majeed Achakzai, for the boy who was trampled to death by Nawaz Sharif’s cavalcade, for those martyred in Quetta and Parachinar, for the children sodomised in Punjab, for the acid victims of Sindh, for the children who died of famine in Tharparkar, for the victims of Joseph Colony, for those found in body bags in Karachi, and the hundreds who were burned alive in Baldia Factory.

Maybe our corridors of political power are immune to the cries of a grieving citizenry. Maybe our system of governance is beyond redemption. Maybe we are cursed to live and die, each moment, in silent despair. Maybe the few voices that muster the courage to speak, will have no impact in the face of entrenched insolence.

If that be the case, let us hold onto our grudges for that final Court of Justice.

August is a time of celebration and reflection in Pakistan. While the state gears up for a celebration, many of us pause and reflect on what Azadi means for each of us. In locating oneself in history, we are reminded that it is his story after all. The mainstream narrative of history—of politicians, institutions, regions and communities—erases the experience of women. We eulogise the ‘horrors’ and ‘sacrifices’ of Partition, but our collective trauma causes us to bury its lived experience in the past.

So great is the pain and trauma of Partition that our collective recollection of it stops at the abductions of women. It glazes over rapes, mutilations, pregnancies and abortions. In some villages in Punjab, women were stripped and paraded naked. In others, they chose to commit suicide or were murdered by their patriarchs rather than fall into the hands of the other community. Understandably, these details are harder to talk about. Thanks to the work of mainly Indian researchers like Urvashi Butalia, Kamla Bhasin and Ritu Menon and memoirs of prominent Muslim women and activists like Anis Kidwai, we have some chronicles of the experience of Partition and its aftermath for women. Manto’s and Quratulain Hyder’s riveting fiction have brought these experiences to life in ways we can’t escape.

When we do mention these painful experiences, we speak of them as happening over there, away from our families and communities. Yet they are very much part of our identity and heritage. In her interviews with families who lived through Partition, Butalia found the stories of women in the silences and gaps of Partition recollections. Refugee families would, for example, speak of a certain number of family members leaving their hometown, and a lesser number reaching their destination in India. When pressed about the loss of life, they could talk about the deaths, but not the abductions. The shame was too great.

Further, our collective trauma forces us to talk about the Partition as past and closed episodes. But as the work of Kidwai and others who worked with refugee women tells us, the trauma lingered. As late as 1955, legislatures of both countries were discussing how many abducted women were repatriated back to the parent country. This repatriation was happening in mechanical ways: Muslim women abducted to India belonged in Pakistan, and Hindu and Sikh women belonged in India. There was no room for the will and consent of the women who were being forcefully repatriated. The ‘Inter-Dominion Treaty Regarding the Security and Rights of Minorities,’ concluded in April 1950, labelled all religious conversions during the period of “communal disturbance” as forced conversions. It dealt with the question of refugee women in a mere fifty-four words. No wonder then, it could not account for women who by now had accepted their fate and settled into their new families, perhaps had children as well. Their lives may have been upended by the violence of Partition, but memoirs like Kidwai’s highlight that many recognised that they were unlikely to be accepted back by their families now. They did not want to undergo further violence. But the choice to stay and legal process was denied to them: they and their husbands did not have recourse to the writ of habeas corpus, which allows for recovery of abducted persons to challenge this repatriation by the two states. Both states and the law saw them only as parts of their community, not individuals with agency.

Once ‘recovered,’ many women found themselves as pariahs. Their maternal families and communities would not accept them. Their children were taken away from them. On this side of the border, women like Ranaa Liaqat, an activist in the freedom struggle and later first lady of the country and Governor of Sindh, spearheaded efforts to rehabilitate these women. The All Pakistan Women’s Association (APWA) was set up to home, train and rehabilitate such women. Neighbourhood imams however, labelled these abandoned women and women like Liaqat as besmirched filth at best, and prostitutes at worst.

These are far from isolated chapters in our history. It is understandable that the collective trauma and pain of Partition keeps us from talking about these experiences fully. But without a collective mourning over it, the trauma continues, and we are bound to blindly repeat these mistakes. The events of 1971, and the recent trend of abduction and forced religious conversion of women from minority communities in Pakistan is a symptom of this festering wound. After Partition, we failed to overcome our shame and fear, and did not do the necessary work of seeing women as individuals with free will. Women are still seen as honour for their families and communities. As a result, abduction and conversion of women are being weaponised as ways to hurt and humiliate their community.

Women in public life, to this day face abuse, rape threats and character assassinations for taking public or unpopular stances. The recent revelations of harassment women journalists face online is an example of this. The vitriol targeted at participants of the Aurat March is another example. The treatment they face is not very different from the treatment Ranaa Liaqat and her compatriots faced for their work. A recognition of APWA’s radical history, of Rana Liaqat’s place in history beyond just Liaqat Ali Khan’s wife, and research into other women leaders of the time would alleviate this, if we are willing to take an uncomfortable look at history.

The generation of Pakistanis who experienced it in 1947 is dying out. When they speak of ’47, they never spoke of ‘independence’ but of ‘Partition.’ This is the gravity of their pain, a pain that they silently carried and passed on to us today. Revisiting the painful chapters of Partition is necessary to free ourselves from this collective bind.

In April 2017, the UN General Secretary in his tweet, pointed towards the mounting evidence of domestic violence after COVID-19 all around the world. Such incidents have not only increased in developing countries, where the domestic violence laws are mostly ineffective but as well in developed societies, where otherwise strict laws are in place. In societies like Pakistan, where people are usually too shy to interfere in the domestic matters of strangers, considering it a personal matter, the incidents of domestic violence have rapidly increased after coronavirus due to various reasons. First, after the outbreak of pandemic, a number of employed males are working from home. Such compulsive stays at times cause friction with relations, especially with the wife. The second reason stems from societal expectations from a woman of being “perfect” in household chores, irrespective to which economic strata she belongs. This becomes more challenging, especially if there is no household help available. For working wives, the conditions are more complex—on one side, they are bound to fulfil their career responsibilities by being at home, while on the other, they are anxious about household chores. In such an environment, gender discrimination in societies like Pakistan escalates further because here women already face social inequality. Moreover, it is believed that a female’s prime responsibility is towards her home-related tasks, regardless of her professional profile.

The grievances of such women are countless and of multiple nature, which I realised while going through a Facebook group discussion of over 28,000 highly-educated women, based on domestic challenges they confronted after COVID-19. A majority expressed that they feel mental pressure and physical fatigue, because of household-related responsibilities in a joint family structure, where they have to fulfil the expectations of both—the husband and in-laws. In the same group, a woman shared her story and asked for suggestions from other members about how she should deal with her abusive husband. She mentioned that she faces this treatment by her partner and in-laws, despite her doing various household chores like cooking and taking care of the multiple demands of her husband.

Another challenge which Pakistani women face in this pandemic concerns education. Although many analysts do not consider this a gender-specific issue, rural schoolgirls, who are bound to stay at home, without any alternative academic strategy, are the worst sufferers. Before this medical emergency, they had an outlet in the form of attending schools, no matter if it was miles away; now they are confined at home and occupied exclusively with household tasks. The non-availability of online education at public schools has further aggravated their handicaps. In comparison with boys, who can at least go outside their homes to socialise, the girls have no choice but to be confined in the four walls of their homes. This remains a significant gap between a male and female, even when they are siblings. Important to note is that even those exclusive girls who are fortunate enough to have the facility of online education, are also expected to participate wholeheartedly in household chores regularly, eventually affecting their academic performance.

Apart from education, women’s health related challenges have also multiplied during the crisis, especially for those who are in pregnancy, as they are unable to receive regular medical check-ups, due to the emergency conditions at the hospitals and clinics. Providing regular attention to mothers-to-be has become a daunting task. The most vulnerable are underprivileged women, who are unable to access medical help because of financial hardships, due to financial meltdown. According to a recent United Nations report, 48.1 percent of women between the age of 15 to 49 years have no preference for medical facilities. The conditions for rural women are even more vulnerable, because of many additional factors like the non-availability of healthcare facilities, financial constraints and lack of awareness towards health issues.

Apart from education and health, another challenge for women is unemployment. During the COVID-19 spread, in every country, millions of people have been laid-off and Pakistan is no exception. The most affected are women, especially those who were associated with the informal sector and did not have job security. According to a United Nations report, in comparison with men, globally women are facing 25 percent more extreme poverty. It is expected that after the pandemic is over, this rate would further increase.

Finally, it is important to say that whether it is a pandemic or conflict-like situation, history has witnessed that women have been more affected than men. This is especially relevant for those societies, who already have gender-biased laws and attitudes. Unfortunately, even in such emergencies, those in charge do not consider gender-inclusiveness while formulating policies, which makes the already under-privileged female class worse than ever.",['Dr Zamurrad Awan'],"Share:In April 2017, the UN General Secretary in his tweet, pointed towards the mounting evidence of domestic violence after COVID-19 all around the world.

France new Prime Minister Jean Castex, has sided with President Emmanuel Macron in backing incoming interior minister Gerald Darmanin.

Darmanin, who landed the job on Monday as part of cabinet reshuffle, was accused of raping Sophie Patterson-Spatz in 2009, when he was a local counselor in northern France.

The woman claims that Darmanin pressured her into sex after she asked him for legal help with overturning a suspended prison sentence for blackmail and threats against a former boyfriend. The 37-year-old politician insisted that it was a consensual encounter and sued the woman for slander.

A preliminary inquiry began in 2017, when Patterson-Spatz came forward with the claims, but was dropped months later after prosecutors said they could not establish an “absence of consent”.

The Paris court of appeals ruled last month, after a back-and-forth legal fight, that the inquiry may be reopened.

The appointment has set off protests from campaigners against sexual violence and government critics, despite the fact that Darmanin has not yet faced any charges. “It’s a slap in the face,” said Pauline Baron of the feminist group NousToutes. “We are once again celebrating people who are accused of rape or say things that negate the voice of victims. It stifles victims and feeds sexual violence and rape culture.”

On Tuesday, some two dozen feminist demonstrators gathered outside of the Interior Ministry, chanting “Darmanin, rapist” and “Darmanin, resign”.

Berlin-An independent study commissioned by the Roman Catholic Church uncovered hundreds of cases of sexual violence allegedly committed by clergy and laymen in Germany’s top diocese, its authors said Thursday. The long-awaited 800-page report on the Cologne diocese found 202 alleged perpetrators of sexual assault and 314 victims between 1975 and 2018, Bjoern Gercke, a lawyer mandated by the Church, told reporters.

“More than half of the victims were children under the age of 14,” Gercke said.

However, the investigation cleared Cologne’s Archbishop Rainer Maria Woelki, a conservative who has long resisted reform, of breach of duty over the abuse.

‘Tragedy of Cologne’

Woelki had faced months of protests for refusing to allow the publication of an earlier study on abuse committed by priests in his diocese.

He had justified his decision by citing a right to privacy of the alleged perpetrators accused in the report, carried out by a Munich law firm, and what he called a lack of independence on the part of some researchers.

His approach was branded “a disaster” as recently as late February by Georg Baetzing, president of the German bishops’ conference.

In the wake of Thursday’s damning report, Woelki said he was suspending two Cologne Church officials, bishop Dominikus Schwaderlapp and the head of a diocese court, Guenter Assenmacher, with immediate effect, citing a “cover-up” of abuse cases.",[],"Share:Berlin-An independent study commissioned by the Roman Catholic Church uncovered hundreds of cases of sexual violence allegedly committed by clergy and laymen in Germany’s top diocese, its authors said Thursday.

In the wake of Thursday’s damning report, Woelki said he was suspending two Cologne Church officials, bishop Dominikus Schwaderlapp and the head of a diocese court, Guenter Assenmacher, with immediate effect, citing a “cover-up” of abuse cases.","['german', 'diocese', 'study', 'woelki', 'perpetrators', 'sexual', 'gercke', 'sex', 'abuse', 'church', 'child', 'report', 'finds', 'committed', 'hundreds', 'victims', 'cases']","{'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/rsss.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/android_app_on_play_logo_small.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/g_plus.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/linkedin_share.png', 'https://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619912693.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png?date=2019-02-15', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/twitter.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_publishrr.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/utube.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2021-03-19/report-finds-hundreds-of-child-sex-abuse-cases-in-german-diocese-1616094751-7635.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/uploads/theme/logo-1550475639.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619902433.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/whatsapp_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/facebook.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/app-store.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2021-05-02/so-what-disaster-are-we-writing-about-today-stories-today-pandemic-pverty-scandal-1619896356-6502.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2021-03-19/report-finds-hundreds-of-child-sex-abuse-cases-in-german-diocese-1616094751-7635.jpg'}",True,https://nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2021-03-19/report-finds-hundreds-of-child-sex-abuse-cases-in-german-diocese-1616094751-7635.jpg,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nation,,2021-03-18

The parents of Sabika Sheikh, a Pakistani exchange student who was killed in the deadly mass shooting in a Texas high school two years ago, have started a foundation to keep her memory alive through providing university scholarships to low-income Pakistani women, according to a report in The Houston Chronicle.

Ms. Sheikh, 17, was among the 10 people killed in the 18 May 2018 shooting at Santa Fe High School near Houston, Texas. Thirteen others were wounded.

Her parents, Abdul Aziz Sheikh and Farah Naz, have created the Sabika for Peace Foundation to expand educational opportunities for those most in need, the Chronicle said.

“I’m always worried that we might forget (Sabika),” Farah Naz, the mother, told The Houston Chronicle during a Zoom interview with the family from their Karachi home. “But starting this foundation I know this is impossible. I know if I continue working with foundation, she will always be with me.”

The foundation is a partnership between the Sheikh family and several prominent nonprofit organizations, including the Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund and the American Council for International Education (ACIE), the report said. ACIE, the American Institute for Foreign Study and the International Education and Resource Network are providing a seed grant of $300,000 to establish the foundation, which will support programmes to “honor Sabika’s memory,” including by providing scholarships to fund university studies for low-income Pakistani women, particularly those with civic engagement aspirations.

Naz, Sabika’s mother, said that ACIE representatives approached the family prior to the coronavirus pandemic with the idea of honouring Sabika’s legacy through an educational foundation. While the pandemic presented some obstacles in getting the organization off the ground, in part because the academic year in Pakistan was postponed, the hope is that the foundation will be prepared to give out scholarships whenever Pakistani schools reopen.

“I’m always worried that we might forget (Sabika),” Naz said during the Zoom interview. “But starting this foundation I know this is impossible. I know if I continue working with foundation, she will always be with me.”

The Sheikh family said the scope of the foundation will target scholarships for universities in Pakistan for now, but will eventually expand to offering exchange opportunities for American schools “so that the connection and ties” with the United States continues, said Sania Sheikh, Sabika’s sister.

The new foundation will be led by a board of directors, which will include representatives from the Sheikh family as well as four independent directors selected by the family in consultation with the partnering organizations. Everytown for Gun Safety, which is representing Sabika’s parents in two civil lawsuits against the accused Santa Fe High School shooter’s parents and an online ammunition dealer, will maintain an advisory role with the foundation.

Sabika Sheikh came to Santa Fe High School in August 2017 as a youth ambassador with the State Department-sponsored Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study programme, which provides scholarships for secondary school students from countries with significant Muslim populations to spend one academic year in the United States.

She excelled academically and threw herself into the American teenage lifestyle, volunteering at the local library, dressing up as a pirate for Halloween, keeping score at baseball games and attending graduations, according to the report. At the time of the shooting in May 2018, Sheikh was weeks away from returning home to her family in Karachi.

Her sister, Sania Sheikh, said that despite Sabika’s distance from her family and the inherent difficulties being a young Muslim girl living in a small, rural, politically conservative Texas community, she believes Sabika cherished her school year in the United States.

“I think my sister spent the best days of her life in America,” Sania was quoted as saying.",[],"Ms. Sheikh, 17, was among the 10 people killed in the 18 May 2018 shooting at Santa Fe High School near Houston, Texas.

ISLAMABAD-Ministry of Human Rights on Friday held awareness session on child rights and prevention of child abuse in Sabzi Mandi, I-11, Islamabad for three child protection committees.

A statement released by the ministry said that to continue Minister of Human Rights Dr. Shireen Mazari’s mission to raise awareness of public about the rights of children and prevention from child abuse, the Ministry of Human Rights through its Human Rights Awareness Programme engaged three more child protection committees from Sabzi Mandi area, Meher Abadi and I-9 to inform them about the rights of children, and ways in which children can be protected from child abuse through community based measures.

The session was conducted at the Office of the Chairman, Market Committee, Sabzi Mandi I-11 Islamabad where the audience of 45 participants comprised of parents, civil society representatives, community leaders and media.

Director General (IC), Ministry of Human Rights, Hassan Ali Mangi shared his views on child rights saying that the society must follow the guidelines of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and treat its children with love and care.

He further said that it is the duty of parents, society and the government to provide a safe space for the growth of children. He further encouraged community representatives to hold dialogue with children about child abuse.

Adding to that he said that MoHR is committed to protect the rights of every child in Pakistan and the role of parents and teachers in sensitising them and raising awareness on self-protection. Discussion was based around the rights of children in the constitution of Pakistan, protection of child rights, role of MoHR and its pledge to protect the rights of every child in Pakistan.

Participants were enlightened to encourage children to speak out whenever they feel uncomfortable with anyone whether it’s the peer, family or someone at school. The members were also informed about newly passed bill of domestic labour under Schedule 1 of the Employment of Children Act 1991, in an effort to strengthen legislation pertaining to the issue as child domestic labour causes children physical, psychological, moral and social harm. The participants were encouraged to report cases on any kind of Child Abuse on the Ministry’s helpline 1099 which is easily accessible to everyone.

There is no denying the fact that women are vulnerable to arbitrary cultural values and traditions distinct across the world. Historically, women were marginalised in different societies as they would assume a negligible role in decision making in public as well as private spheres of life.

Women often experience obstacles in gaining access to mechanisms of redress, including legal aid, counselling services, and shelters. They are re-victimised and exposed to further risk of violence through the denial of redress in the context of informal trials or negotiations between families and community leaders.

The payment of financial compensation by the perpetrator or his family for acts of violence against women, in place of legal remedies, was a recurrent concern vis-à-vis the formal and informal justice systems. Violence against women in Pakistan is systematic. It is underpinned by the persistence of patriarchal social norms and inter-and intra-gender hierarchies. Women are discriminated against and subordinated not only based on sex but on other grounds too, such as caste, class, ability, sexual orientation, tradition, and other realities.

Gender violence is most often unseen and is shrouded in a culture of silence. The causes and factors of violence against women include entrenched unequal power equations between men and women that foster violence and its acceptability, aggravated by cultural and social norms, economic dependence, poverty and alcohol consumption, etc. In India and Pakistan, the culprits are often known to the woman; the social and economic “costs” of reporting such crimes are high. General economic dependence on family and fear of social ostracisation act as significant disincentives for women to report any kind of sexual violence, abuse, or abhorrent behaviour. Therefore, the actual incidence of violence against women in Pakistan is probably much higher than the data suggests, and women may continue to face hostility and have to remain in environments where they are subject to violence.

This silence needs to be broken. In doing so, men, perhaps more than women have a duty and role to play in averting and combating violence against women. Unlike many other victims of interpersonal crimes such as theft, robbery, or muggings, survivors of sexual assault are vulnerable to being blamed for their attack, and thus victim-blaming (overtly or in more subtle forms) in sexual assault cases has been the focus of several writings. Myths and stereotypes “underlie and fuel sexual violence against women and inform negative societal reactions”. And cultural attitudes which law has long endorsed and which continue to infuse the criminal justice process, albeit in more covert, less accessible forms.”

At the highest (or, rather most aggravated) level, sexual violence is rape with or without attendant violence. However, there are a substantial number of incidents that fall within the rubric of sexual violence, that amount to offenses under various penal enactments. These outlaw behaviours such as stalking, eve-teasing, shades of verbal and physical assault, and harassment. Social attitudes typically characterise this latter category of crimes as “minor” offences. Such “minor” crimes are, regrettably not only trivialised or normalised, rather they are even romanticised and therefore, invigorated in popular lore such as cinema. These attitudes which indulgently view the crime through prisms such as “boys will be boys” and condone them, nevertheless have a lasting and pernicious effect on the survivors.

The United Nations Organisation has defined “violence against women” as “any act of gender-based violence that results in or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or private life.” The effect of offensive behaviour against women, which laws criminalise physical, verbal, or other acts that threaten or give them acute discomfort, undermining their dignity, self-worth, and respect, is to silence or subdue the survivor. Our courts should desist from expressing any stereotype opinion, in words spoken during proceedings, or in the course of a judicial order, to the effect that (i) women are physically weak and need protection; (ii) women are incapable of or cannot take decisions on their own; (iii) men are the “head” of the household and should take all the decisions relating to the family; (iv) women should be submissive and obedient according to our culture; (v) “good” women are sexually chaste; (vi) motherhood is the duty and role of every woman, and assumptions to the effect that she wants to be a mother; (vii) women should be the ones in charge of their children, their upbringing and care; (viii) being alone at night or wearing certain clothes make women responsible for being attacked; (ix) a woman consuming alcohol, smoking, etc. may justify unwelcome advances by men or “has asked for it”.

Judges can play a significant role in ridding the justice system of harmful stereotypes. They have an important responsibility to base their decisions on law and facts in evidence, and not engage in gender stereotyping. This requires judges to identify gender stereotyping, and identify how the application, enforcement, or perpetuation of these stereotypes discriminates against women or denies them equal access to justice. Stereotyping might compromise the impartiality of a judge’s decision and affect his views about witness credibility or the culpability of the accused person.

The more general indictment of the current criminal justice process is that the law and legal doctrines concerning sexual assault have acted as the principle systemic mechanisms for invalidating the experiences of women and children. Given this state of affairs, the traditional view of the legal system as neutral, objective, and gender blind is not defensible. Since the system is ineffective in protecting the rights of women and children, it is necessary to re-examine the existing doctrines which reflect the cultural and social limitations that have preserved dominant male interests at the expense of women and children. Our judiciary and society both can play vital roles to be impartial in words and action, at all times. If they falter, especially in gender related crimes, they imperil fairness and inflict great cruelty in the casual blindness to the despair of the survivors.",['Shahrukh Mehboob'],"Gender violence is most often unseen and is shrouded in a culture of silence.

KARACHI - The majority of child abuse cases in Pakistan go unreported, according to child protection experts speaking at a seminar Safeguarding Children: Communities, Schools and Online organised by Aga Khan University’s Institute for Educational Development, IED. Even though Pakistan has a range of laws to protect children, poor implementation of regulations alongside a low conviction rate mean that child abuse continues to be a persistent problem in society. Highlighting ways to report child abuse, experts noted the actions parents can take to protect a child. For example, if abuse has occurred and medical help is needed, parents can go to a hospital. They may also inform the police by dialing 15 or call the child protection authority on 1121. Dr Kishwar Enam, lecturer at the department of paediatrics at AKU’s Medical College and president, Child Protection Services, Aga Khan University Hospital, said that around the world seven out of ten cases of child abuse take place at homes (such as the residence of victims or offenders). Dr Enam noted that this figure is likely to be similar in Pakistan but cautioned that underreporting of crimes means that statistics from NGOs and the Sindh government are likely to underestimate the scale of problem. “There are many reasons why cases go unreported,” said Dr Enam. “These include fear of the perpetrator, concerns about being stigmatised by society, economic dependence, inability to recognise child abuse as being improper, poor awareness of ways to complain and lack of trust in the system.” Speakers at the event expressed concern about the growing number of child abuse cases in Pakistan and discussed how neighbourhoods, schools and parents can take steps to reduce the risk of abuse which can happen to children of any race, socioeconomic group, religion or culture.",['Staff Report'],"Share:KARACHI - The majority of child abuse cases in Pakistan go unreported, according to child protection experts speaking at a seminar Safeguarding Children: Communities, Schools and Online organised by Aga Khan University’s Institute for Educational Development, IED.

The heart-wrenching incident of the rape of a mother and four years old little child has shaken the country. I am in the state of melancholy and grievance for my innocent people who are victims of rape and the extortion. They feel no security in their own country. It seems we have no morality, ethics, and humanity. Every day we witness the gang rapes of underage girls and little children who are angels.

The recent incident of gang rape in Kashmore speaks volumes of helplessness and inhumanity. The gang-rape perpetrator along with his friend has kept this innocent mother and daughter for three days. He has no fear of being exposed and taken by police for vindication. It is a blot on society that there is an incremental rise in cases even though we have condemned and have drafted a legal punishment for the rapist. Here are some points that I suggest are the reasons for a drastic increase in the cases of rape.

1. Our judicial procedure is very slow in punishing the heinous criminals

2. Children have no education about body protection

3. Our government response to catch these culprits is very sluggish

4. The law-abiding forces fail to ensure security.

These above-mentioned factors are the reasons that we are victimized and the culprits are at freehand. The government has to ensure the security and abide by the law enforcers to bring the deviant persons and let them have the most severe punishment. These paedophiles have no religion and family of their own because they have no mercy for children and helpless women. It is desirable if the punishment of castrating and life imprisonment must be given to them so that they live permanently with shame that their action was inhuman and a blot on the society where they are to live.

If there is a delay in justice in such heinous cases then we can expect more cases of the same nature. The pendency in the cases reap the frustration and the culprit takes the chance to go for another crime. This procrastination is not favoured in the real justice system. The Islamic justice system is flawless and speedy in the dispensation of justice.

May God guide us to the right path.

Despite having numerous unsettled questions about the working model for Pakistan, the entire nation unanimously accepts that the state was formed as a laboratory of Islam where the principles and teachings of Islam could be implemented in letter and spirit. However, with the passage of time, our people and rulers have unlearned the basic teaching of Islam taught to us by the Quran and Holy Prophet (PBUH) i.e. it disapproves of any sort of coercion in the matters related to religion altogether and respects human free will. The founding fathers of Pakistan were very clear about the matters related to state-religion and advocated the freedom to follow religion for every citizen. However, the state created in the name of Islam which is house to almost 207 million people out of which Hindus and Christians collectively comprise 3.1 percent of the total population is under the threat of forced conversions and religious extremism. In Pakistan, the majority of the Hindu population (i.e. 6.8 million) animates in the Sindh province owing to its cultural and historical affiliation with the region. And this is where this brutal practice is being carried out by the so called propagators of the religion.

Recently, the US has declared Pakistan as a country of ‘particular concern’ for having involved in/or accepted systematic ongoing and egregious violation of religious freedom. According to the report published by US Commission on International Religious Freedom, Pakistan failed in fortifying its minorities and guaranteeing religious freedom. The ministry of foreign affairs in Pakistan has declared this label as ‘arbitrary and unilateral’ for selectively targeting some countries while ignoring the rest. However, the statistics quoting the number of incidences of forced conversions to Islam show a different picture altogether. According to a report by South Asia partnership-Pakistan and Aurat Foundation, at least one thousand Hindu girls in Pakistan are kidnapped, forcibly converted and married off to their kidnappers every year. Similar data has been reported by the University of Birmingham’s Lawyer Amarnath Motumal of the HRCP. His report informed that no less than 20 Hindu girls are kidnapped and proselytised every month in Pakistan.

Ironically, Pakistan is a signatory of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and has ratified the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which clearly endorses the right of every woman to enter into marriage ‘only with their free and full consent’ but the present situation of the Hindu women in Pakistan clearly shows the ugly side of the picture. Pakistan is badly failing in achieving her commitments under these contracts and saving her minorities from forced conversions and marriages. There are a number of factors that make the Hindu community in Sindh more prone to forced conversions than the rest of the country. These factors include their stark socio-economic conditions, strong missionary zeal for conversion, lack of access to justice, failure of the Sindh criminal law (protection of minorities) bill, inadequate legislation on the registration of Hindu marriages, etc.

In our in-egalitarian society, there exists huge inequality where a class of society enjoys a privileged status and liberty while others even struggle for recognition of their basic rights. The lack of financial empowerment makes the poverty-ridden Hindu population particularly at risk of proselytisation. Similarly, the conservative clergy portrays forced conversion analogous to ‘hajj-e-Akbar’ that will bring rewards in akhirat (hereafter), irrespective of the methods employed to achieve the course of conversion. Extremist Clerics like Mian Mitho and Ayub Jan Sarhandi have become renowned veritable ciphers of proselytisation in Sindh who manipulate their followers to employ every means possible to ‘confirm their tickets to paradise’. Also, minor Hindu girls choose conversion as a means to realize their aspirations of a better life and put an end to their miserable existence.

There are a number of steps that must be taken by the government to protect the rights of minorities in Sindh in particular and Pakistan in general. The Sindh Criminal Law (Protection of Minorities) Bill which could not be passed as the house with 171 members were held hostage by a bunch of religious zealots should be passed to make it a Law across the country. This can be achieved by promoting a national level dialogue Engaging clergy and the general public to avoid further conversions and create inter-faith harmony in the society by tackling human rights abuse. Judicial and police system should be reformed for fast response to the matters related to proselytisation. The government should also ruminate over launching Provincial Commissions for minorities to take up forced conversion and forced marriage cases and guarantee religious minorities’ access to education, jobs, and government positions through passing anti-discriminatory laws.

In conclusion, every state has the responsibility of protecting its people from individuals and organizations that try to convert people by resorting to coercion or exploitation of the particular vulnerability of people. The government of Pakistan has an obligation to ascertain that forced conversions do not occur in the milieu of marriage or marriage negotiations which can be achieved by including people in the process of national development irrespective of their religion and creed. It is high time our people should learn the lesson that it’s their behaviour, not religion that makes them better humans.",['Asma Nisar'],"However, the statistics quoting the number of incidences of forced conversions to Islam show a different picture altogether.
Pakistan is badly failing in achieving her commitments under these contracts and saving her minorities from forced conversions and marriages.
The lack of financial empowerment makes the poverty-ridden Hindu population particularly at risk of proselytisation.
Extremist Clerics like Mian Mitho and Ayub Jan Sarhandi have become renowned veritable ciphers of proselytisation in Sindh who manipulate their followers to employ every means possible to ‘confirm their tickets to paradise’.
Judicial and police system should be reformed for fast response to the matters related to proselytisation.","['religious', 'conversion', 'rights', 'islam', 'minorities', 'forced', 'pakistan', 'conversions', 'proselytisation', 'hindu', 'sindh']","{'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/rsss.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/android_app_on_play_logo_small.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/g_plus.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/linkedin_share.png', 'https://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619912693.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png?date=2019-02-15', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/twitter.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_publishrr.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/utube.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/uploads/theme/logo-1550475639.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619902433.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/whatsapp_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/facebook.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/app-store.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2021-05-02/so-what-disaster-are-we-writing-about-today-stories-today-pandemic-pverty-scandal-1619896356-6502.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png'}",True,https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nation,,2020-01-26

I always knew that sexual abuse existed, preying on girls and boys of all ages, a predator that along with physically, mentally and emotionally hurting its victims, silenced them into carrying the burden of a secret that keeps them in a spiral of shame for years at end; a shame that never belonged to them to begin with.

Five years ago, I started learning about the complexity of sexual abuse as many of my clients shared stories of being abused as children, teenagers or adults by family members, teachers and trusted friends, and the most common theme that ran was how it was in therapy that they shared it for the first time.

It would take session after session as they would share what happened, overwhelmed with grief and exhaustion of carrying the pain and most importantly, the shame of not being able to tell anyone. They believed that their silence meant they were party to this heinous act and as a therapist, I tried my best to reassure the adult sitting in front of me that it was the abused child within them who was silenced into fear and submission. I tried my best to comfort that child who is so convinced that he or she made it happen.

For healing to begin, that’s where my work started. Peeling away layers after layers of shame that they inherited, unpacking their memories so they can remember how they were threatened into silence, how they waited for their parents to notice why suddenly they are losing their appetite and are withdrawn, hoping for someone to check on them as they sit alone with a Qaari saab or tuition teacher. That’s the beginning of healing as they start remembering the anguish, the fear of wanting to share what was going on but could not. They suffer from chronic symptoms that include anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.

I choose to write about this as a day before I read about how a teacher who ran the Model United Circuit (MUN) in Lahore at the esteemed Lahore Grammar School is allegedly involved in sexually harassment of A Level students for years to end. Some of the students have come forward with sharing texts sent out by this teacher and protesting and expressing how in spite of sharing this with the school administration, no action was taken until now, where the principal has expelled the alleged perpetrators. Simply expelled, claiming they have nothing to do with them, saving their school reputation and enabling more abuse as those men will continue in other spaces as sooner than later this event will be forgotten. That man should have been held accountable so justice could be served as well as a lesson for other perpetrators.

The point I am trying to raise here is that this is the dark and dynamic nature of sexual abuse. Most will keep it a secret for years and don’t you wonder why that is? Most often it remains hidden due to a combination of denial, manipulation, and confusion. The victim is manipulated into silence and a state of confusion that they are responsible for making it happen and that leads to the victim staying in denial that it ever really happened and becoming a secret keeper.

Unfortunately others that include their families do not believe some who get the courage to share or in this case as per the students claim the administration did not pay heed to their complaints. Only a rare few get the chance to heal from the trauma of abuse by being heard and validated by others.

Many of you who are reading this have been victims of sexual abuse. You are still keeping it silent believing that you asked for it and feeling shame for what was done to you and not by you. It is very hard to tell someone about it, isn’t it? And then you also believe what’s the point now? And how can just talking about it make it better? I have moved on. I no longer think about it. But that’s where you are wrong. That abuse is still part of your life and might be coming out in the depression and anxiety you face and you believe it’s because of a job failure or sickness. You might be getting physically ill too, whether it’s a migraine or a chronic muscular pain that refuses to get better.

Remember that it’s not your fault. Speaking up is the first step and the most difficult. Reach out to a professional. A trusted friend! Anyone! Talk about it and take the power away from your abuser who silenced you into shame for years. Today can be the day you don’t have to silently survive!!",['Zara Maqbool'],"I tried my best to comfort that child who is so convinced that he or she made it happen.

The international day for women is celebrated every year on March 8 around the world to mark a call to action for accelerating gender parity. This day reminds nations worldwide to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women be they social, political and economic. It further calls for an end to domestic violence and harassment against women. But in Pakistan, we witnessed a sad picture on this day when religious clerics clashed with Aurat March’s participants in Islamabad. Opponents of the Aurat March left no stone unturned to dilute the spirit and objectives of the march and some labelled it a foreign-funded vulgar campaign against Muslim women. One of the slogans of the March, “My body, my choice” was misinterpreted and remained a subject of criticism by the conservatives. The manifesto of Aurat March 2020, which called for the end of patriarchy, domestic violence, and harassment against women, increase in salaries and economic independence, better health and education facilities, and self-respect, was trampled under the foot. It is a sad reality that Pakistan is one of the worst countries for women to live in, which can be seen in the denial of social rights to women, discrimination, honour killings, brutal rapes and abductions, marital rapes, forced marriages, and induced abortions. This dark reality in our society has ranked Pakistan the 6th most unsafe country for women.

There is no denying the fact that even though the female population in Pakistan is 48.54 percent of the total, the female labour force participation rate is 22 percent according to the World Bank’s collection of development indicators, which is much lower when it is compared with 68 percent of their male counterparts’ participation. There is a plethora of national and international studies which substantiate the fact that women in our country are very vulnerable. The World Economic report 2018 ranked Pakistan at 148 out of 149 countries for women empowerment. In this connection, let’s consider the following findings.

Forced child marriages are not a new problem in Pakistan. It is being practiced in our country for the last many decades. Pakistan has also been facing the dilemma of honour killings known locally as karo-kari. Statistics from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan suggest there were 1,276 such murders between 2014 and 2016. Though Pakistan’s parliament passed a law against killings linked to honour or izzat, the numbers of such killings are not decreasing, especially in rural areas where many such crimes are not reported and go unpunished. Then consider the ratio of induced abortions that occur in our country. In 2018, a representative from the United Nations Population Funds (UNPF) announced that there were 2.2 million abortions in the country every year. Almost half the pregnancies that occur in Pakistan are unplanned and unintended and 54 percent of them end in abortion mostly in an unsafe way.

Pakistani women, unfortunately, have been culturally relegated to the low-priority section, especially in the case of female education and with social rewards in reproduction and domestic activities. We see a bleak picture when it comes to female education. Female literacy rate is 45 percent, which is very low when it is compared with male literacy rate that is 69 percent. Illiteracy on the part of parents and misinterpretation of Islamic injunctions relating to women are the two major reasons behind this issue.

Though gender inequality is a global issue, it lies at the heart of multiple problems in Pakistan. It is unfortunate that Pakistani society is not reacting against the gender imbalance and vicious cycle of violence to a considerable extent because of ignorance and a gender-based biased approach.",['Mian Rauf'],"But in Pakistan, we witnessed a sad picture on this day when religious clerics clashed with Aurat March’s participants in Islamabad.

Peshawar-Capital City Police on Friday claimed to have arrested the man who had allegedly killed a minor girl and later torched her body in Balokhel village on the suburbs of the provincial capital.

Speaking at a press conference, Capital City Police Officer Muhammad Ali Gandapur said that the accused, Asif Raza alias Malang, had confessed to have killed and later burnt the body of the seven-year-old girl (A).

“The accused confessed that he first raped the minor girl, then killed her and later burnt her body to destroy any evidence,” said the CCPO, who was accompanied by SSP Operations Mansoor Aman, SP Saddar Waqar Ahmad and other officials on the occasion.

Since the incident, the accused switched off his phone and also kept on changing his locations to evade arrest but the police nabbed him during a raid in Khyber tribal district, Gandapur added.

He said after the recovery of the charred body of the minor girl on November 19 in Badaber Police Station limits, they formed five teams to trace the blind murder case.

“One team started profiling and checking the local residents, the second team worked on intelligence gathering on the case, the third was technical team working on mobile phones data, the fourth team interrogated the suspects, and the fifth team was raiding various places for the arrest of the accused,” the official added.

Meanwhile, local villagers in Balokhel torched the house of the accused soon after his arrest.

ISLAMABAD - The National Assembly of Pakistan and President House buildings went orange on Wednesday to show solidarity with the global 16 days of activism campaign against Gender-Based Violence (GBV) in Pakistan.

Women parliamentarians from several political parties as well as representatives from the government, UN agencies and civil society also participated in the event and pledged to put in efforts for ending violence against women and girls in Pakistan. They promised to play an active role in freeing the country from all forms of gender-based violence and discrimination and stand with and support survivors.

The event was jointly arranged by the Federal Women’s Parliamentary Caucus (WPC) and UN Women Pakistan to kick off the 16 Days of Activism against GBV, a global campaign that takes place each year from November 25, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, to 10th of December, International Human Rights Day, indicating that violence against women is the most pervasive violation of human rights worldwide. The 16 days campaign is used as an organizing strategy by individuals and organizations around the world to call for the prevention and elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls.

With the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, this year’s theme for the 16 days of activism against GBV is “Fund, Respond, Prevent, Collect”.

The theme calls for prioritizing support and funding to essential services for GBV prevention and response especially in the COVID-19 situation, supporting women’s rights organizations working at the nexus of COVID-19 and GBV.

It was also declaring a national policy of zero tolerance for GBV with a concrete action plan, launching behavior change social mobilization campaigns, undertaking explicit measures to maintain services for survivors of GBV as essential during COVID-19 lockdowns.

Speaker National Assembly, Asad Qaiser graced the event as the Chief Guest.

Secretary WPC Munaza Hassan gave the welcome remarks at the start of the event. Resident Coordinator United Nations in Pakistan, Julien Harneis addressed the event that was attended by parliamentarians, representatives of the government, UN agencies, civil society and media, both virtually and in-person at the National Assembly.

Speaker National Assembly, Asad Qaiser while addressing the event, said: “The Government is committed to end violence against women as a topmost priority.

It’s time to recognize the role of women and take substantial steps for ensuring equal participation of women in legislation.

Gender equality cannot be achieved without ending violence against women and girls. Women need to be encouraged and motivated and the present government was committed for the protection of women’s rights and providing them safe environment.

In order to give women their due status, we also need to change the mindset and behavior. Joint efforts are needed to bring them into mainstream.”

Giving welcome remarks, Secretary Women’s Parliamentary Caucus Munaza Hassan said, “The world is undergoing significant social, political, economic and environmental development, which leaves a deep mark on our people – especially women of every household.

With COVID-19 resurgence, the world retreats inside homes due to lockdowns, making situation even worse for women. Escalation in already existing pandemic of violence against women is quite visible.

The Constitution of Pakistan negates any discrimination on the basis of gender. Its Articles 25(3) and 34 are the two most significant articles in favor of women. Article 25(3) states that nothing shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the protection of women.

The Women’s Parliamentary Caucus has been at the forefront of improving legislations for the rights of women and we will continue our efforts along with our trusted partners.”

“The fact that we have women in key decision-making roles of national importance, leading portfolios of human rights, social safety, health, and climate change, guarantees women protection and representation at all levels,” she remarked.

Harneis appreciated the pledge taken by all participants during the event, and expressed the hope that each person would follow through on this pledge in their lives to prevent gender-based violence from happening in all public and private settings.",['Our Staff Reporter'],"Share:ISLAMABAD - The National Assembly of Pakistan and President House buildings went orange on Wednesday to show solidarity with the global 16 days of activism campaign against Gender-Based Violence (GBV) in Pakistan.

There are so many areas in Pakistan that need serious looking into and effective changes to take place immediately. There are overwhelming issues like education and health that have been grossly neglected but so many invisible ones that do not get talked about, where only those involved are suffering.

A friend of mine lives in a girls’ hostel in Islamabad. Expected to be a safe place for girls who live far away from families, this hostel, like many other hostels, makes them feel unsafe amongst other issues.

After some on-ground research what I found, to say that it left me horrified is an understatement. Most hostels charge around fifteen thousand per month including below-average food and amenities, which doesn’t cover air conditioning. The rooms are shared by 3 to 5 girls and are in deplorable condition to say the least. There is fungus on most of the walls, poor ventilation and broken furniture and dilapidated room conditions. The bathrooms are dirty and overall hygiene is poor, yet in spite of protests from the girls, not much changes.

In many cases, there is a single warden who is the caretaker, enforcing rules like a curfew for girls to be back by 10pm.

Most of these girls were all willing to compromise with these issues but the main and most alarming problem is the lack of safety.

The owner of this particular hostel, a young man, has his office in the hostel, and all day, men can come and go as they please, harassing these girls with their unwarranted leers, trying to initiate conversation with them. The owner himself had asked a few of them to be friends with him, making threats otherwise and creating hostile conditions for those who protest.

Who will protect girls who come from smaller cities with dreams of better lives and professional opportunities? Whose responsibility is to hold these hostel owners accountable for treating these young women in this way? Most of them experience sexual harassment of some form every now and then.

They live with this insecurity of their ‘izzat’ being threatened day in and out, as they step out of their homes for education and jobs but to come back to these hostels and feel even more unsafe, which is downright criminal.

Unlike the popular belief that the floor wardens are there to protect the girls; they seem to be involved in this process of harassment too. These girls are also emotionally abused by being asked to show their phone messages or interrogated about their comings and goings by threatening them of false stories to be shared with their families.

These girls feeling indebted to their families for allowing them this little pocket of freedom – which is actually their right – live in this trauma day in and out, paying a price for a better future.

Isn’t it the job of the local government to look into this and create safer living conditions for these young women? What breaks my heart is that these educated girls are not even aware of their rights and are scared to protest against this. When I asked my friend, she said she will be sent back so she doesn’t want to take this risk.

There are always anti-feminist slogans raised by our men for feminists having extreme views, but being a female in this society can be a living nightmare. From an ogling gaze to a random sexual touch to being explicitly asked for more, I wonder if the men of our society understand what happens for that woman. So many women are desensitised and ashamed of their bodies. They start taking less care of it, demonstrate less body maintenance and protection and the harassment still doesn’t stop.

In my own experience, on a rare occasion, when I decided to take an Uber around 10 at night, I was literally pushed into a car with 4 men and luckily managed to get away. That day I realised how vulnerable and exposed our women are using public transport.

In this case, the home these girls live in is unsafe with no way of protecting themselves.

I hope someone can take serious notice of this. As citizens of this country we cannot and should not turn a blind eye to any injustice. Sometimes, small changes in invisible areas can go a long way too. It’s eighty percent now and hundred percent never so let’s do whatever we can to highlight these issues.

To all the men out there who are reading this; stand up for the vulnerable woman on the road by stopping the male next to you who looks at her with disrespect or crosses any boundary. And if you can’t, then think twice before questioning why radical feminism is the need of the hour.",['Zara Maqbool'],"A friend of mine lives in a girls’ hostel in Islamabad.

The world media is reporting a deal having been brokered between USA and Afghanistan — a love-hate relationship at the best of times. Afghanistan turned out to be USA’s darling as they were warmly hosted at the White House during the Soviet-Afghan war. The Soviet Union attacked on 25th December 1979 and took over Afghanistan which resulted in the loss of uncountable lives of innocent Afghanis. The United States decided to counter Soviets in Afghanistan and so decided to recruit Muslim Arabs to launch as Jihadists and took help in doing the same from Pakistan. The US supplied arms, finance and logistical support as it gave military assistance to the mujahedeen against Soviets.

The fight between the Mujahedeen started and these jihadists from abroad started fighting with local Taliban and ultimately defeated Russia with the support of Pakistan and the CIA. When the Soviet Union was defeated, the United States ditched the mujahedeen by leaving abruptly from Afghanistan. These Afro-Arab terrorists then revolted against Pakistan and the USA.

The Afghan Refugees influx arrived in Pakistan after this war which marked the beginning of a long period of troubles for Pakistan. There is a long history of how Mujahedeen converted into Taliban and later Taliban turned into Al-Qaeda. The government of Hikmat Yar could not sustain and after the fall of his government, the Taliban took over the rule of Afghanistan. The 9/11 attacks brought the USA back to Afghanistan and since then the hide and seek between both the Taliban and the USA continued and this never-ending war has brought miseries both to Pakistan and Afghanistan.

The peace talks began in November 2010, when U.S. diplomats and Taliban representatives met for the first time, in Bonn, Germany in an international conference on Afghanistan. Talks between U.S. and Taliban representative continued till the early months of 2012 when the USA offered to continue peace talks on one condition, if the Taliban agreed to lay off the weapons and agreed to negotiate with the Afghan Government.

As a result of this, the Taliban broke off contact as they refused to negotiate with Kabul. The “cold war” continued until 2013 when the Taliban sent a message to Washington to reopen peace talks and also agreed to meet the Afghan Government through intermediaries in Qatar. This also did not appear to be fruitful as U.S. and Afghan officials refused to address them as representatives of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

In December 2015, the Quadrilateral Coordination Group (QCG), comprising Afghanistan, China, Pakistan and the U.S was organised to hold peace talks between Afghanistan and the Taliban but it also could not prove to be a balanced mechanism to bring lasting peace to Afghanistan like all other former breakthroughs, as it effectively blocked Russia and Iran from the negotiating table. In December 2016, Russia took the initiative to host talks in Moscow on Afghanistan with both Pakistan and China followed by two further rounds of talks in February and April 2017 including India, Iran, the Central Asian states, and the Afghan government in which the US refused to participate because of Russia and ultimately it also got failed.

In November 2018, Russia’s foreign ministry again confirmed the peace on Afghanistan on November 9, wherein it invited Afghanistan, the US, Pakistan, Iran, India, the five bordering Central Asian states, and the Taliban for the talks in Moscow. India was represented by Amar Sinha, former ambassador to Afghanistan, and TCA Raghavan, former ambassador to Pakistan.

In December 2018 and from June – August 2019 again, few more rounds of dialogue were held between USA/Afghan Govt officials and Taliban in Abu Dhabi and Doha. Though the Afghan officials and the Taliban never met face-to-face, but the intermediary countries; Saudi Arabia USA and Pakistan conveyed messages on their behalf. The US officials and a Taliban delegation discussed a potential prisoner exchange and also the Trump administration decided to withdraw half of its 14000 troops from Afghanistan. Zalmay Khalilzad, an Afghan-US diplomat who served as US ambassador to the United Nations (2007-2009), Iraq (2005-2007) and Afghanistan (2003-2005), represented Washington in the said talks.

Since 9/11 the only country that has affected the most due to terrorism is Pakistan and still is bearing the brunt of ongoing insurgency in the region. According to some estimates, Pakistan lost more than 70,000 lives and over 6,000 soldiers in the ongoing war on terror. Along with this, it cost the economy over $120 billion. The peace process with the support of Pakistan is inching toward success which is a piece of great news for Pakistan and Afghanistan in particular and for the world in general.

Nevertheless, this time the USA looks to be very serious because of the directive of President Donald Trump. I have a few observations for direct and indirect involvement in this process on the basis of these factors below:

1. Who will be the Guarantor of the ceasefire?

2.Will Ashraf Ghani step down or will there be a national government with the Taliban?

3. What would be the impact of serious differences between Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani on this deal.

4. Or — pursuant to above, is it a part of the strategy to use the disputed election to accommodate the Taliban in a national government whereas there is no provision of an interim govt in the Afghan constitution?

I would like to extend the highest appreciation to COAS, Gen Qamer Bajwa, as it is his great success the initiative he took under the ”Bajwa doctrine”. The stable, consistent and highly diplomatic role of Ambassador Khalil has been great who continued this mission with great patience with all the stakeholders to achieve despite many ups and downs.

It will be a great success of President Donald Trump before his general election and this withdrawal factor and deal with the Taliban will create a great positive political impact on his forthcoming campaign and subsequent votebank of his election as the President. It is to be seen as what will be the covert and overt reaction of Iran, India, Russia, China and Saudi Arabia and other middle Eastern countries. The main leadership of Overseas Afghan Talban is under the control of Mr. Sirajuddin Haqani with other Taliban groups. It is yet to be seen how the old Northern Alliance, Tajik faction and factional parties show their reaction to this deal.

I understand Pakistan has played a great role and I have earlier also enforced this solid proposal, to request the USA either to withdraw the complaint from FATF against Pakistan or use its influence and get Pakistan cleared. I stand by my earlier statements in FATF that Pakistan will remain in the FATF and half of Pakistan will be convicted on money laundering/terrorist financing until the USA withdraws its complaint. Hence the easy way is to manage through skilful diplomatic efforts through high offices of Pakistan to link this deal to get out FATF. I had stated on 29th November, 2019 and two weeks back on the floor of the house that we must move forward towards USA and not the other 800 participants of the FATF meeting to get out of FATF.

Pakistan must take a wise move and link the exit from FATF with USA - Afghan peace deal. We should request USA to withdraw its complaint from FATF allowing Pakistan to have financial freedom and to create faff free investment environment if the USA wants a favourable outcome of peace talks with Pakistan’s help, as there’s no such thing as free lunch in the world. We need to get out of FATF to block the economic meltdown because of fast sliding economy.",['Rehman Malik'],"Share:The world media is reporting a deal having been brokered between USA and Afghanistan — a love-hate relationship at the best of times.
