Having won a Fringe First award at the 2019 Edinburgh festival, this might, like O’Connor’s previous shows, have gone on to international tours. When the world returns to a much longed-for normal, that may yet happen. In the meantime, though, this recording is being made available to a worldwide audience via the Edinburgh Traverse’s new, virtual venue, Traverse 3.</p> <p>While I am happy to have seen the production (directed by Hildegard Ryan), and will be interested to discover more of O’Connor’s work in the future, the energy she clearly projects into the live audience does not make its way through the small screen. The excitement of the experience of the performance and the vividness of the language and intensity of the delivery no longer mask the weaknesses of the writing.</p> <p>There’s a clockwork feel to the way events are presented along a too-obviously calculated narrative arc. Starting just before its end, the story then returns to its beginning, leaving a question hanging; this comes across as an attempt at suspense rather than the real thing. Similarly, in what feels like a prod to stimulate audience curiosity, the character produces mustard in bottles from two carrier bags as she talks us through an unhappy affair, then pours the mustard into a paddling pool, which she inflates, without explanation. Our guess as to what might happen turns out not to be wrong. Although such suspended questions and enigmatic actions can enhance dramatic drive, they cannot compensate for its absence.</p> <p>O’Connor tackles the subject of a woman struggling with self-harm and heartbreak bravely, but she hasn’t yet quite managed to find the form for the material that will transform it into drama. </p> <p>• <a href=""https://www.traverse.co.uk/whats-on/event/mustard"">Available online until 14 December</a",False,pillar/arts,Arts,['woman+murder']

As he moved her into the back of his patrol car, she thought of a Black woman like her, Sandra Bland, who was pulled over and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/07/sandra-bland-video-footage-arrest-death-police-custody-latest-news"">died in custody</a> three months prior. Anderson fainted.</p> <p>“You can’t even put words to the kind of fear I was facing,” said Anderson, now 52, who was pulled over due to an issue with her car insurance and taken to jail. “I didn’t think I was going to live through it.”</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>I didn’t think I was going to live through it</p> <footer> <cite>JeAnna Anderson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When she later got her phone back from police, Anderson discovered that someone, probably Armour, had used her camera to take a photo of her on the ground with a male police officer standing above her, according to a lawsuit she later filed against the city that detailed her account of sexual assault.</p> <p>Anderson is speaking out for the first time as the US is <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/defund-the-police-us-george-floyd-budgets"">grappling</a> with the deadly and racist legacy of law enforcement institutions. In the wake of the George Floyd <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/10/george-floyd-protests-what-happens-next"">uprisings</a>, police in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/01/los-angeles-sheriffs-department-reckoning-police-shootings"">cities</a> across the country are <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/13/vallejo-california-police-violence-sean-monterrosa"">starting to face scrutiny</a>, and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-killing-derek-chauvin-charge-elevated-three-other-officers-charged"">some consequences</a>, for using fatal force, and mayors and chiefs are pledging to restrict the violent tactics that make America an <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/09/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries"">international leader in police killings</a>.</p> <p>But there has been little reckoning over one prevalent form of brutality entrenched in the culture of US law enforcement – the epidemic of sexual abuse by the police. Studies have suggested that sexual misconduct on the job is rampant with one <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/01/police-sexual-assault-investigation"">investigation</a> finding roughly 1,000 officers lost their badges for rape and other sexual offenses in a six-year period. But it’s likely these cases only scratch the surface of this form of state-sanctioned assault. </p> <p>The Phoenix police department has <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/06/phoenix-police-shooting-james-jay-garcia"">one of the deadliest records</a> in the country and a history of sexual abuse cases. Records obtained by the Guardian reveal that officer Armour has multiple assault and misconduct allegations on his record, including sexual abuse, but has only faced a temporary suspension for one incident. </p> <h2>Violated, then arrested: ‘I couldn’t breathe’</h2> <p>Anderson had never been arrested before that night. A longtime Phoenix resident working in healthcare credentialing, she had gone out that evening to pick up allergy medication from a pharmacy and cash from an ATM. Her Yorkshire terrier, Dallas, was in the passenger seat when Anderson heard tires squealing and saw a police SUV turn around and start trailing her. </p> <p>Armour’s hostile tone immediately made her feel unsafe, she recalled: “He kept saying, ‘You know why I’m pulling you over.’” Eventually he told her that her license was suspended. She tried to show him a motor vehicles document she had received that day about an issue with her outdated insurance, but he wasn’t interested.</p> <p>Anderson wanted a witness to the encounter, but Armour refused to call anyone. Filming was her last option, but she wasn’t able to press the record button in time, she said.</p> <p>Anderson immediately felt excruciating pain “like a lightning strike” as Armour twisted her arm backward and dragged her out. She cried as he started groping<strong> </strong>her and then fell silent. “I had lost total control of the situation,” she said.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""ec86979fcee8416b9d41da124613f1eabbf8f893""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/ec86979fcee8416b9d41da124613f1eabbf8f893/0_0_2002_3000/667.jpg"" alt=""Anderson had never been arrested before 16 October 2015, the night she says she was groped and sexually assaulted by a Phoenix police officer."" width=""667"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Anderson had never been arrested before 16 October 2015, the night she says she was groped and sexually assaulted by a Phoenix police officer.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Callaghan O\'Hare/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the police car, she recalled suffering panic attacks and collapsing face forward. “I said, ‘I can’t breathe,’” she recalled, noting that other officers showed up to the scene. No one seemed to take her health concerns seriously, even though paramedics arrived to treat her elevated blood pressure. “They were like, ‘Stop faking it. You’re going to jail.’”</p> <p>While she was sitting on the curb in custody waiting for a friend to arrive to get her dog, Dallas came up to her and licked the tears off her face. She pleaded not to be taken alone with Armour, but the officer drove her away to the Phoenix jail.</p> <p>Anderson was booked for resisting arrest, threatened with a six-month sentence and $2,500 fine.</p> <h2>Hundreds of cases: ‘An ideal system for sexual violence’</h2> <p>Between 2005 and 2015, there were 517 cases of forcible rape by police in the US, according to Philip Stinson, a Bowling Green State University criminal justice professor. An officer is accused of <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/how-some-cops-use-the-badge-to-commit-sex-crimes/2018/01/11/5606fb26-eff3-11e7-b390-a36dc3fa2842_story.html"">sexual misconduct</a>, the second most common complaint against officers, at least once every five days in the US, according to <a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/bncore/projects/abusing-the-law/index.html"">one analysis</a>.</p> <p>“When people read a story in the paper about an officer charged with a sex crime, they think it’s one officer, it’s horrible, it can’t happen much,” said Stinson. “It’s not until you aggregate it all that you realize this is a phenomenon. It’s far beyond ‘bad apples’.”</p> <p>Police typically target the most vulnerable people. In a seven-year period, Stinson <a href=""https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/249850.pdf"">found</a> that half of the sexual misconduct arrests against officers involved minors. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/11/daniel-holtzclaw-former-oklahoma-city-police-officer-guilty-rape"">Daniel Holtzclaw</a>, a serial rapist, was convicted for<strong> </strong>targeting eight Black women in Oklahoma when he was in uniform. Officers frequently assault women of color, domestic violence victims, informants and women facing traffic stops, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/how-some-cops-use-the-badge-to-commit-sex-crimes/2018/01/11/5606fb26-eff3-11e7-b390-a36dc3fa2842_story.html"">experts say</a>. </p> <p>“When you are pulled over by police, you have to comply or else they are legally entitled to enact severe forms of violence against you,” said Alisa Bierria, professor of ethnic studies at the University of California, Riverside and advocate for sexual assault survivors. “It’s a system that is organized in ways that are most ideal for a person who would engage in sexual violence.”</p> <h2>A history of complaints and no discipline</h2> <p><strong> </strong>In Phoenix, advocates say the same police culture that allows officers to kill with impunity has enabled officer attacks on vulnerable women.</p> <p>In June, Phoenix prosecutors <a href=""https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2020/06/24/phoenix-police-officer-sean-pena-charged-sexual-assault-unlawful-sexual-conduct-women-custody/3255072001/"">announced charges against officer Sean Pena</a>, who allegedly raped one woman who he had handcuffed and sexually assaulted another. In 2015, Phoenix officer Timothy Morris was <a href=""https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/ex-phoenix-cops-acquittal-on-felony-sex-charge-frees-accuser-to-sue-city-8290985"">charged with sexually assaulting a handcuffed woman</a>, but was acquitted after he claimed it was consensual. Last year, an officer in the nearby city of Mesa was allowed to keep his badge and benefits after the city’s own <a href=""https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/mesa-cop-accused-of-serial-sexual-misconduct-gets-full-retirement-11419337"">investigation</a> found a pattern of sexual harassment of civilians and female officers.</p> <p>In July, the Guardian also uncovered <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/14/revealed-phoenix-womans-brutal-police-assault-shown-on-body-camera-footage"">body-camera footage</a> showing a male officer tackling and slamming a young woman to the ground during a routine traffic stop. The department said it was justified.</p> <p>Meanwhile, JeAnna Anderson is not the first woman to speak up about Armour’s conduct since he joined the department in 2006. </p> <p>In 2011, a woman accused him and a colleague of pulling her over for no reason into an alley and interrogating her alone at 2.30am. In 2012, police investigated a complaint suggesting Armour had<strong> </strong>“engaged in sexual activity” with a woman he was investigating for drug offenses. That same year, Armour was investigated for an incident involving a woman who had called 911 to report a possible “prowler”, his personnel records show. When he arrived at her door, she had a knife in her hand, and Armour ended up shooting her. She survived and was charged with assault and drug possession. In February 2015, he was also accused of pushing a woman to the ground and leaving her on the concrete during an arrest. (Phoenix police reports said there were no violations,<strong> </strong> and no actions were taken.)</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>On their best days, [police] show up after a harm has happened and collect evidence. On their worst days, they are committing crimes themselves</p> <footer> <cite>Heather Hamel</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A few weeks after Anderson’s arrest, Armour was again accused of barging his way into a home without authorization and arresting a woman inside. The department later concluded he was guilty of “false arrest”, unlawful entry, disobeying a supervisor and making multiple false statements. He received an 80-hour suspension.</p> <p>Last year, a woman was <a href=""https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/arizona-woman-freed-from-prison-because-of-cops-history-of-lies-11222176"">freed</a> from prison after it was revealed that law enforcement failed to disclose Armour’s record of lying. She spent two years behind bars.</p> <p>Anderson’s prosecution dragged on for nine months until the resisting arrest charge was dropped. During that time, she was recovering from physical injuries from the arrest, including a long-term shoulder injury, according to her complaint. “When I hear the stuff he has done before I knew my gut was not lying to me,” said Anderson. </p> <p>Armour has not faced any discipline in Anderson’s case.<strong> </strong>He was approved for early retirement last year at age 40 with a monthly pension of $3,143.</p> <p>A Phoenix police spokeswoman, Mercedes Fortune, declined to comment on Armour’s cases, citing pending litigation. Attorneys for Armour did not respond to inquiries, but in court have said he denies her sexual assault and excessive force allegations and did not take a photo of her with her phone.</p> <h2>‘Who do you call when your rapist is a police officer?’</h2> <p>For survivors, the process of reporting sexual assault by police can be harrowing.</p> <p>“Who do you call when your rapist is a police officer?” said Stinson, the researcher in Ohio.</p> <p>In December 2018, Phoenix police stopped Erica Reynolds as part of a drug investigation, and although they found no evidence in her car, took her to a police station. There, officers made her strip naked and conducted searches of her anal and vaginal cavities, which did not turn up any drugs. The officers did not have a warrant to search her, and last year the city concluded that the search violated policy, which says the searches require a warrant with a judge’s approval and must be conducted by a medical professional.</p> <p>“I wasn’t going to allow them to get away with it,” Reynolds, 38, told the Guardian. So she immediately went to the hospital and reported it: “I tried to do the best thing I can do, and get it checked out. I said, ‘I think I was raped by police.’”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""046768147b3d7ba4b2501c823e9949ce00a1f305""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/046768147b3d7ba4b2501c823e9949ce00a1f305/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg"" alt=""Erica Reynolds sued the Phoenix Police after they subjected her to an illegal cavity search."" width=""1000"" height=""667"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Erica Reynolds sued the Phoenix Police after they subjected her to an illegal cavity search.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Caitlin O’Hara/Caitlin O\'Hara for The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The doctors did what they typically do when a patient reports sexual assault – they called the police. According to Reynolds’ complaint, the police department declined to investigate or send a forensic nurse to conduct a rape kit. Her doctors diagnosed her with “sexual assault and rectal bleeding”.</p> <p>Reynolds ultimately was never charged with any drug crimes. While police acknowledged the search was out of policy and paid Reynolds a settlement, the department never acknowledged it constituted sexual assault. “They were ready to rip my whole life apart,” she said, recounting the extensive investigations she faced as a suspect in the aftermath. “They are going to do whatever they want … and use the ‘war on drugs’ as a cover-up.” </p> <p>One officer received a 40-hour suspension, but the officials who ordered the illegal search were not punished. They all remain on duty. Phoenix police declined to answer questions about Reynolds’ case.</p> <h2>How police budgets could be reinvested</h2> <p>Efforts to curb police violence, including sexual assault, have <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/16/its-not-about-bad-apples-how-us-police-reforms-have-failed-to-stop-brutality-and-violence"">repeatedly fallen short</a>. Now, advocates are hoping the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/defund-the-police-us-george-floyd-budgets"">calls to defund the police</a> could provide a new way forward.</p> <p>“When we talk about defunding police, or a world without police, people have this kneejerk reaction of, ‘Who do we call to keep ourselves safe?’” said Heather Hamel, a Phoenix civil rights lawyer who represented Anderson and Reynolds. “But we need to ask ourselves if police are actually doing that. On their best days, they show up after a harm has happened and collect evidence. On their worst days, they are committing crimes themselves.”</p> <p>Instead of fixing officers’ behavior, departments are dedicated to defending them and dragging victims through years-long court battles that end with the city paying settlements, Anderson noted: “If they can’t get it together, then police officers are a waste of time.” </p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""2a8090e72625de7a86297b8c85dd894809113f9e""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/2a8090e72625de7a86297b8c85dd894809113f9e/0_103_5089_3054/1000.jpg"" alt=""Protesters rally to demand the Phoenix city council defund the city police department."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Protesters rally to demand the Phoenix city council defund the city police department.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Matt York/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reynolds said it was hard not to think of all the resources police put into investigating her, assaulting her and then continuing to pursue a case against her. “They wasn’t doing no police work. How much funding do you need to come over here to pull people over?”</p> <p>Advocates say <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/defund-police-movement-could-offer-sexual-assault-survivors-different-path-n1235478"">funds could be reinvested</a> in shelters, services and other programs that help victims. Meanwhile, Phoenix police have a <a href=""https://theappeal.org/how-phoenix-police-department-spends-its-budget/"">$721m budget</a> – and the city is currently increasing funding by $24m.</p> <h2><strong>The aftermath: ‘I just wasn’t myself any more’</strong></h2> <p>The Phoenix women’s encounters with police have had long-term impacts on their lives.</p> <p>Reynolds has struggled with physical intimacy since her assault and lives in fear of police, particularly in South Phoenix, where she was raised: “I have to stay away from where I grew up because of them,” she said. “They’ve never said we’re sorry we caused turmoil in your life.”</p> <p>Anderson’s life unraveled after her assault. Her relationship fell apart. She became too anxious to drive alone at night, and shut down the fitness-wear business she was launching: “I just wasn’t myself any more. I was angry. I was always hurt. There would be times I would be afraid to leave my house.” At one point, she ended up living in a women’s shelter. </p> <p>Anderson eventually left Phoenix. “The fear just wouldn’t go away and I said I need to leave, I don’t deserve to live like this,” said Anderson, who moved to Texas in February. While it’s been easier to recover away from Phoenix police, she said the incident sometimes feels like “it maybe happened a week ago”.</p> <p>She’s hoping that more women will come forward. “I am only one woman, but more people need to fight. Police officers are supposed to serve and protect, but there was no one there to protect me that night.”</p> <p><em>In the US, Rainn offers support at 800-656-4673 or by chat at www.rainn.org.

Are you done?” asked one nurse in French as Echaquan moaned in pain.</p> <p>“You made some bad choices, my dear,” another nurse said. “What are your children going to think, seeing you like this?”</p> <p>“She’s good at having sex, more than anything else,” the first nurse said.</p> <p>Indigenous leaders say the video exposes the grim realities of systemic racism that have long gone ignored throughout the country.</p> <p>“Discrimination against First Nations people remains prevalent in the healthcare system and this needs to stop,” the Assembly of First Nations national chief, Perry Bellegarde, said in a statement.</p> <p>The Quebec premier, François Legault, condemned the actions of the staff, telling reporters at least one of the nurses had been fired.</p> <p>But the premier rejected the notion that Echaquan’s death was representative of a broader problem of racism within Quebec, despite a public inquiry <a href=""https://www.cerp.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/Fichiers_clients/Rapport/Final_report.pdf"">concluding the opposite</a>.</p> <p>“I really don’t think we have this kind of way of dealing with First Nations people in our hospitals in Quebec,” he said.</p> <p>The province’s coroner office has announced an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Echaquan’s death.

And they are dying, having heard racist words expressed towards them.”</p> <p>Contrary to remarks by Legault, however, Miller said Echaquan’s death was reflective of broader barriers Indigenous peoples still face in Canada.</p> <p>“This is not an isolated event,” said Miller, pointing to the case of a hospital in British Columbia, where <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/racism-in-bc-healthcare-health-minister-adrian-dix-1.5619245"">staff allegedly bet</a> on the blood alcohol content of incoming Indigenous patients.</p> <p>For those who have experienced similar treatment to Echaquan’s, the video marked a jarring reminder of the inequities present within the country’s healthcare system.</p> <p>“I’m not sure I can adequately explain how watching the video of #JoyceEchaquan’s last moments is weighing on me.

books/2020/dec/04/alison-lurie-obituary,article,books,Books,2020-12-04T17:12:15Z,Alison Lurie obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/04/alison-lurie-obituary,https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2020/dec/04/alison-lurie-obituary,"Few writers have shown such a commitment to their characters as the US novelist Alison Lurie, who has died aged 94. Her 11 works of domestic and academic black comedy are peopled with an interconnecting cast, who move from the sidelines to centre stage, often reassessed and redeemed on second appearance, sometimes transferred from childhood to adulthood.</p> <p>Lurie’s most consistent character is the acerbic literary critic Leonard Zimmern, who pops up to extol the virtues of the single life in The War Between the Tates (1974), attack the study of children’s literature (his creator’s own specialism) in the Pulitzer-prize-winning Foreign Affairs (1984), undermine the theories of the feminist biographer in The Truth About Lorin Jones (1988), laugh at nature writers in The Last Resort (1998) and expose the pitfalls of early literary success in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/nov/13/fiction.features1"" title="""">Truth and Consequences</a> (2005).</p> <p>Lurie accounted for his nearly ubiquitous presence by explaining that Zimmern was the hero of her first, rejected novel and so, sorry that he could not have a book of his own, she brought him back in a series of supporting roles. But his habit of revealing the self-delusion of others suggests that he functions as her alter ego, always ready with a pin to prick pretensions, much as Lurie was herself.</p> <p>She began to write, she said, to amuse herself and other people, but described her inspiration as the desire to laugh at things. Often compared to the work of Jane Austen, Lurie’s satires of marriage and manners have a savage quality. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/01/gore-vidal-dies"" title="""">Gore Vidal</a> dubbed her “the Queen Herod of modern fiction” (a description Lurie herself disliked) for her portrayal of the Tates’ revolting adolescent children in The War Between the Tates; but the most shocking moment in the book is when the narrator comments, of the put-upon wife and mother Erica: “The fact that she hates her own children is her darkest, most carefully guarded secret.”</p> <p>Taking the Vietnam war as a metaphor for marital crisis, this is one of her funniest novels, if also her bleakest, with its details of lawyers who privately decide whose divorce to delay on the grounds of likely reconciliation and whose to speed up; there is also its devastating closing comment on the Tates: “They will forget that they are ugly, foolish, guilty and dying.”</p> <p>Elsewhere, political correctness, feminist dogma and sociology all come under the dissecting knife. Each critique is balanced by a more positive perception, however, either within one novel or between novels. Thus the caricatured lesbians of The Truth About Lorin Jones are answered by the sympathetic portrayal of Lee and Jenny in The Last Resort. Always keen to reflect on the zeitgeist (ecology in The Last Resort, new age sects in the 1967 novel Imaginary Friends), Lurie is nothing if not scrupulously fair.</p> <p>She was born in Chicago, the elder daughter of socialist parents, Bernice (nee Stewart), a journalist, and Harry Lurie, a sociologist, grew up in White Plains, New York, and graduated from Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1946. After a spell as a reader for the New York office of the Oxford University Press, she married Jonathan Bishop, an academic, in 1948 and followed his fledgling career, moving to Harvard, Amherst College and later UCLA before they settled at Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York, in 1961. Lurie’s three sons were born during this period and her first serious attempts at writing (she was a member of the Poets’ Theatre group at Harvard, along with <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/04/john-ashbery-obituary"" title="""">John Ashbery</a>, James Merrill and Frank O’Hara) date from then.</p> <p>After two early rejections (and the efforts of her husband and friends to persuade her to drop the enterprise and spend more time on her family), Lurie’s first published novel, Love and Friendship, appeared in 1962. It was set in the imaginary New England town of Convers (a fictionalised Amherst), and its picture of chauvinistic faculty members and the claustrophobia of small-town academic life was an early indication of Lurie’s tendency to use facets of her own experience in her fiction. Other examples are her use of Los Angeles in The Nowhere City (1965), of London in Foreign Affairs, and of Florida in The Last Resort, all locations in which Lurie habitually spent part of each year.</p> <p>Best known is her creation of the precious writers’ colony Illyria and its control-freak owner in the novella Real People (1969). This was based on the actual retreat of Yaddo, Saratoga Springs, New York, where Lurie spent time on her second and third novels. It caused such offence that she did not feel able to return there.</p> <p>At the end of the 1960s, Lurie took a teaching post at Cornell (the model for the fictional Corinth of The War Between the Tates, Foreign Affairs and Truth and Consequences). Remarking later on the difficulties facing female academics, she noted: “It took me four novels to get a job teaching one course at the lowest possible level.” Initially a lecturer, in 1976 she was made Whiton professor of American literature.</p> <p>Her specialism was children’s literature, and she published a number of folk-tale collections, a novel written from a child’s perspective (Only Children, 1979) and two collections of essays, Not in Front of the Grown-Ups (1990) and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jul/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview"" title="""">Boys and Girls Forever</a> (2003). Criticised by some as overly simplistic in their approach, they nonetheless raised the profile of the subject.</p> <p>Lurie’s most enjoyable work of non-fiction is her astute explanation of costume and its meaning, The Language of Clothes (1981). Although her interest in clothing is clear from her fiction (Vinnie and Chuck’s apparel takes on symbolic value in the self-consciously stylish Foreign Affairs, the hippy fashions of the students in The War Between the Tates are drawn with sociological detail, the very different values of Delia and Jane are evident from their clothes in Truth and Consequences), this exploration of the history of communication through what we choose to wear (or manners dictate we must wear) was a surprise. It is an accessible and witty introduction to the subject. The Language of Houses (2014) takes the same lens to architectural design.</p> <p>One of the few writers who successfully combined careers as novelist and academic, and popular on both sides of the Atlantic, Lurie once described her work as using an English literary style to explore American situations. But with her self-doubting heroines and chauvinist husbands, romantic catastrophes and career embarrassments, her drily funny work is much more universal than that would suggest.</p> <p>Lurie’s first marriage ended in divorce. She is survived by her second husband, the novelist and academic Edward Hower, whom she married in 1995, her three sons, John, Jeremy and Joshua, and three grandchildren, and her sister, Jennifer.</p> <p> • Alison Lurie, novelist and academic, born 3 September 1926; died 3 December 2020",False,pillar/arts,Arts,['forced marriage']

It’s part of a scorched earth campaign by Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump to make it as difficult as possible for Iran to resume negotiations with the Biden administration and return to the 2015 nuclear agreement.</p> <p>But the brazen killing is also designed to exploit rifts within Iran’s factional political structure: between conservative politicians and hardline factions aligned with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, and the reformist camp led by the president, Hassan Rouhani. In January, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/baghdad-airport-iraq-attack-deaths-iran-us-tensions"">the US assassinated</a> Iran’s most powerful general, Qassem Suleimani, in a drone strike outside Baghdad’s airport. That attack exposed weaknesses in Iran’s security apparatus and the regime was unable to follow through on threats to avenge the targeting of its top officials. Iran did fire missiles at <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/suleimani-assassination-two-us-airbases-in-iraq-hit-by-missiles-in-retaliation"">US bases in Iraq</a> in retaliation for Donald Trump ordering – and later boasting about – Suleimani’s killing. But that was a largely symbolic act and Tehran has not targeted a US official of equal stature, as it threatened to. Since Fakhrizadeh’s assassination, hardliners have been calling for tougher action in order to restore some deterrence with Israel and, by extension, the US.</p> <p>In a speech on 29 November, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the parliament speaker and a conservative leader, <a href=""https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/11/iran-vow-revenge-nuclear-scientist-killing-fakhrizadeh.html"">warned that</a> a “strong response” was the only way to deter future attacks. He also <a href=""https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/29/iran-parliament-calls-for-end-of-nuclear-inspections-after-murder"">cautioned Iranians</a> against “sending any signals indicating weakness”. Hossein Salami, the top commander of the Revolutionary Guards, vowed at Fakhrizadeh’s funeral: “Enemies should be awaiting our revenge.” The hardline Kayhan newspaper, whose editor was appointed by Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/tehran-newspapers-iran-israel-fbc89e454c5f4dd9e47853b4d0bcfc1a"">published an opinion article</a> urging the Iranian leadership to attack the Israeli port city of Haifa if it concludes that Israel assassinated the nuclear scientist. The article argued that Tehran’s previous responses to Israeli attacks had not gone far enough.</p> <p>These fiery denunciations are not unusual, especially from hardliners, after an attack on Iranian interests attributed to Israel or the US. But leaders of the military establishment, conservative politicians and analysts are signalling to the supreme leader, who has the final say on Iran’s foreign policy and nuclear programme, that even if it waits out the final weeks of the Trump administration without retaliating, Tehran can’t negotiate with Biden from a position of weakness. That vulnerability has been exposed by the recent assassinations and a series of <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/politics/iran-explosion-nuclear-centrifuges.html"">mysterious explosions</a> and fires at Iranian facilities connected to its nuclear enrichment programme.</p> <p>The perception of exposed weakness could lead the Iranian regime to launch a series of escalations – revenge attacks against Israeli targets; advancing its nuclear enrichment; using allied militias in Iraq to attack US troops there; or risky skirmishes with US forces in the Persian Gulf – to try to establish an upper hand to show the world and the Biden administration that it is not weak. Many of these options carry the risk of a wider confrontation, especially if they’re carried out in the waning days of the Trump administration.</p> <p>And Tehran has failed at some past attempts at retaliation. From 2010 to 2012, Iran blamed Israel’s Mossad for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/27/iran-has-long-accused-israel-of-killing-its-nuclear-scientists"">assassinating at least four</a> of its leading nuclear scientists, part of a wider sabotage campaign against Iran’s nuclear programme. In February 2012, Iranian agents tried, and largely failed, to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/17/iran-nuclear-revenge-bomb-plot"">carry out revenge attacks</a> against Israeli targets in India, Thailand and Georgia.</p> <p>If the hardliners’ rhetorical message is that Iran should exact revenge to avoid appearing weak, internally they’re trying to undermine Rouhani’s ability to negotiate with the Biden administration. The conservatives argue that Rouhani will essentially be a lame duck since Iran is scheduled to hold presidential elections in June 2021. Rouhani, who was first elected in 2013, will have served two terms and is not eligible to seek re-election.</p> <p>The conservatives are jockeying to reassert their control over the presidency. In February, conservatives and hardliners <a href=""https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/iran/irans-new-parliament-heralds-conservative-consolidation"">swept a majority</a> of the new parliament, winning 220 out of 290 seats. The election was marred by problems: more than 90% of reformist candidates were disqualified by the Guardian Council, an oversight body controlled by the supreme leader, and <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-51605942"">voter turnout was 42.6%</a>, the smallest of any parliamentary election since the 1979 Iranian revolution. Some conservative politicians are pushing for the next president to come from the ranks of the Revolutionary Guards or another part of the military establishment. It’s possible that the Guardian Council may block any reformist candidate from even running.</p> <p>The Iranian election means that the Biden administration has only a few months after it takes office on 20 January to reach an agreement to return to the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/iran-nuclear-deal-full-text-of-joint-comprehensive-plan-of-action"">joint comprehensive plan of action</a>, under which Tehran had agreed to limit its nuclear programme in exchange for relief from international sanctions. In May 2018, Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the deal and imposed new sanctions that crippled Iran’s economy.</p> <p>While some Iranian officials, such as Rouhani and his foreign minister, Javad Zarif, may view Biden as far more predictable than Trump, others in the Iranian regime are wary of restarting negotiations that can be undone by future US administrations. Already, <a href=""https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2020/nov/24/biden-foreign-policy-team-iran"">Biden’s top foreign policy</a> aides have said that in order for the US to re-enter the nuclear agreement and provide sanctions relief, Iran must commit to follow-up negotiations on broader issues, including Iran’s ballistic missile programme and support for militant groups in the region. That will be difficult even for moderates to accept, with Iran’s presidential election months away. And it’s likely to be a nonstarter for the supreme leader, who wants to project a sense of strength.</p> <p>The other variable in the coming weeks is whether Netanyahu’s government will carry out more provocations that seek to further exploit Trump’s recklessness and divisions within Iran. Fakhrizadeh’s assassination highlighted Israel’s ability to act with relative impunity, especially in evading criticism from the US and much of Europe. The killing is likely to have been in violation of international law, as Agnes Callamard, the UN rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, <a href=""https://twitter.com/AgnesCallamard/status/1332414199042101253"">noted on Twitter</a>. Even a former CIA director, John Brennan, <a href=""https://twitter.com/JohnBrennan/status/1332400792620462082"">lashed out</a> at the targeting of an Iranian official, saying if a foreign government was responsible, it would be “an act of state-sponsored terrorism”.</p> <p>The top scientist’s killing may not set back Iran’s technical capabilities, but it could weaken and humiliate the moderate Iranian factions that are most open to rapprochement with a new US administration.</p> <p>• Mohamad Bazzi is a journalism professor at New York University and former Middle East bureau chief at Newsda",False,pillar/opinion,Opinion,['honor killing']

There were no direct witnesses to the alleged assaults, which include a charge of attempted rape and one of intent to rape.</p> <p>Jackson apologised to the jury for saying earlier in the trial that some of the alleged offences were trivial, but said inconsistencies and contradictions cropped up repeatedly in the testimonies and evidence. And, he alleged, there were signs some of the charges were orchestrated.</p> <p>“This comes out of a political bubble with no real independent support of any kind. I said already it smelled and I don’t apologise for that one bit,” he said, summing up the defence case after the two-week trial.</p> <p>“I don’t care if you like him or you don’t like him. He was the Marmite man but I know he’s entitled to the law’s protection. He’s entitled not to be convicted of anything unless there’s clear evidence.</p> <p>“It’s the same pattern all of the time,” he said, arguing that matters not deemed serious at the time had been inflated to criminal charges later. “All the time – I can’t say that strongly enough – it is the same pattern over and over and over again. It’s scary.”</p> <p>Salmond, 65, from Strichen, Aberdeenshire, is charged with an attempted rape, an intent to rape, nine sexual assaults and two indecent assaults involving nine women, all of whom are current or former Scottish government officials, or a Scottish National party politician.</p> <p>Many of the offences allegedly took place at Bute House, the first minister’s official residence in Edinburgh. Salmond was originally charged with 14 offences but he was formally acquitted of one charge, a 10th sexual assault, on Monday after the prosecution withdrew the charge.</p> <p>Before sending out the jury to deliberate, the judge, Lady Dorrian, told them to weigh up the evidence before them very carefully.</p> <p>There were three verdicts available to them: guilty, not guilty or not proven – a Scottish verdict which also means an acquittal. The jury were able to amend the charges if they felt the evidence did not support the wording on the indictment.</p> <p>On Thursday, Alex Prentice QC, for the prosecution, had told the jury Salmond was a sexual predator who exploited his power to prey on younger, subordinate women. “This case isn’t about a plot or political conspiracy,” Prentice told them. “This is about a powerful man who abused his power to satisfy his sexual desires with impunity.”</p> <p>However, Jackson dismissed Prentice’s argument. He said the inconsistencies and contradictions at the very least raised doubts the allegations were true. He told the jury that if they had any hesitation about the truth or accuracy of the charges, they had to acquit.</p> <p>You cannot take a risk “with his life or anybody else’s life … If you accept any of these things is a criminal matter, you need to be satisfied to that high, high standard.</p> <p>“If you thought they were probably established or more likely than not established … you would acquit him.”</p> <p>He said the crown’s claim that Salmond has sexually assaulted one official with an intent to rape had not been proven. “It’s a hell of an allegation,” Jackson said. “It’s a very, very big allegation to make in the high court.”</p> <p>Allegations by witness H that Salmond had attempted to rape her at Bute House were disproved by a witness in court who said H was not there, he suggested. Although a celebrity, who cannot be named for legal reasons, gave an interview by Skype to the police, that person was not under oath and the defence could not cross-examine him.</p> <p>The celebrity said H was there but that was “totally contradicted” by another witness who was cross-examined in court, Jackson argued: she knew H well and denied she was at the dinner or even in the building.</p> <p>“If you had doubt at all she was there, that is the end of the charge. He cannot be guilty if she wasn’t there,” Jackson told the jury. Jackson implied H wanted revenge on Salmond because he thwarted her professional ambitions. “This is a murky, murky world we live in.”</p> <p>Jackson alleged that witness A, a senior Scottish government official who accused Salmond of repeatedly kissing and touching her without permission in Glasgow in 2008 and fondling her body in a nightclub in Edinburgh, had tried to orchestrate some of the charges.</p> <p>“That stinks,” he said. “It absolutely stinks.”</p> <p>Witness A contacted at least four of the complainers, all serving or former officials, before Salmond was charged, Jackson told the jury. They used a WhatsApp group.</p> <p>A fifth complainer, a senior politician, had refused to take part in those conversations because she felt it was inappropriate, the jury heard. “There’s something that doesn’t smell right in the whole thing and you’re supposed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt” that Salmond’s behaviour was criminal, Jackson argued.</p> <p>The jury retired to begin its deliberations shortly before 2pm.",False,pillar/news,News,['sexual assault']

And I think I might have hurt his tongue.”</p> \n<p>Via his lawyers, Trump denied in the strongest possible terms having ever harassed, abused or behaved improperly toward Dorris.</p> \n<p>Dorris, who lives in Florida, provided the Guardian with evidence to support her account of her encounters with Trump, including her ticket to the US Open and six photos showing her with the real estate magnate over several days in New York.

At the time, Dorris was living with friends in Boca Raton, Florida, regularly travelling to Miami for modelling and occasional acting work. Binn, the founder of several luxury fashion and lifestyle magazines, was a friend of Trump; in 1999, he reportedly described the real estate businessman as his “best friend”.</p> \n<p>On Friday 5 September, Dorris said Binn took her to meet Trump at his office in Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan, before they went together to the US Open in Queens.</p> \n<p>“He came on very strong right away,” Dorris said of Trump. “It seemed typical of a certain guy, people who just feel like they’re entitled to do what they want … even though I was there with my boyfriend.”</p> \n<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""5f82095b3043a7fd23e2d8a00ea1395a2c083b66""> \n <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/5f82095b3043a7fd23e2d8a00ea1395a2c083b66/397_275_674_478/500.jpg"" alt=""Amy Dorris sat between Donald Trump and Jason Binn athe the US Open in Queens 1997."" width=""500"" height=""355"" class=""gu-image""> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=""element-image__caption"">Amy Dorris sat between Donald Trump and Jason Binn at the US Open in Queens 1997</span> \n  <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The couple were joined by other friends of Trump in his private box, a luxury carpeted suite that had a balcony overlooking the court.

She alleges Trump forced himself on her after a brief exchange in which she recalls nervously laughing and telling him: “No, get away.”</p> \n<p>She alleged she told Trump “no, please stop” but “he didn’t care”. “It doesn’t matter who you are,” she said. “Any time anyone says no, no means no. And that just didn’t work out for me. It wasn’t enough.”</p> \n<p>“I just kind of was in shock,” she added. “I felt violated, obviously. But I still wasn’t processing it and just was trying to go back to talking to everyone and having a good time because, I don’t know, I felt pressured to be that way.”</p> \n<p>Dorris cannot recall if she told Binn the full details of the alleged assault, but she says she asked him to tell Trump to leave her alone. She said she told Binn: “He’s all over me. I can’t deal with this.

A further hearing next month will establish what damages Taylor should be awarded.</p> <p>After Taylor, who had been an engineer with Jaguar Land Rover for more than 20 years, began wearing – usually – women’s clothes, she suffered insults and abusive jokes. She said she did not receive support from the management and won her constructive dismissal claim.</p> <p>Part of the argument was whether being gender fluid/non-binary was a protected characteristic under section 7 of the 2010 Equality Act. The protected characteristics covered in the act are age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.</p> <p>The judge ruled that it was “clear … that gender is a spectrum” and that it was “beyond any doubt” Taylor was protected. The judge said gender reassignment “concerns a personal journey and moving a gender identity away from birth sex”.</p> <p>Taylor, who prefers to use the female pronoun, is now working as an engineer with another firm.</p> <p>Her barrister, Robin Moira White, of Old Square Chambers, who has transitioned from male to female, said: “This is an important judgment, albeit at first instance, recognising for the first time the rights of a small number of individuals with complex gender identities.</p> <p>“Once again the courts have shown themselves willing to stand up for the rights of individuals in a manner which demands respect and admiration. I pay tribute to my brave client … I see no reason why this ruling should not extend to other complex gender identities such as a-gender and genderqueer.”</p> <p>White added: “I’m aware of other cases where non-binary/gender fluid individuals have suffered disadvantage in the workplace.”</p> <p>Dave Williams, executive director of human resources at Jaguar Land Rover, told Forbes magazine: “On behalf of Jaguar Land Rover, I would like to apologise to Ms Taylor for the experiences she<strong> </strong>had during her employment with us.

Yes. Is it offensive to assume that someone black or Asian criticising the politics of another black or Asian person is motivated by such sentiment? Yes.</p> <p>Last week, the Conservative MP Neil O’Brien blundered into the latter under the guise of <a href=""https://capx.co/if-youre-an-ethnic-minority-conservative-you-just-cant-win/"">defending his black colleague</a>, equalities minister Kemi Badenoch, from the former. <a href=""https://twitter.com/KemiBadenoch/status/1355130565633126401?s=20"">Badenoch had tweeted </a>screenshots of two private right-of-reply emails the black journalist Nadine White had sent her, accusing her of “creepy and bizarre” behaviour for putting to her claims made by a source.<br><br>This triggered a torrent of abuse <a href=""https://thecritic.co.uk/professionalism-is-a-two-way-street/"">directed at White</a>. There is no question that Badenoch has faced unpleasant racism, but that does not excuse her behaviour towards White, a journalist doing her job, nor her undermining the confidential right-of-reply process that is critical to accurate journalism.</p> <p>That did not stop O’Brien weighing in to try to justify Badenoch’s behaviour. In order to do so, he misrepresented White’s work and conflated her journalism with some of the abuse Badenoch has received on Twitter that has accused her of being a “race traitor”, which has nothing to do with White. All this tends to depict White’s journalism as being motivated by a belief that Badenoch, as a Conservative, isn’t truly black.</p> <p>He didn’t stop there: he also accused the Labour MP Naz Shah of “straight up racism” for claiming that the home secretary, Priti Patel, was gaslighting ethnic minorities by talking about her own experiences of racism. Again, O’Brien misrepresents what happened to give the impression that Shah’s critique of Patel is motivated by a belief that her politics make her less Asian. What actually happened was that the black MP Flo Eshalomi asked Patel a question that referenced her experiences of anti-black racism and the structural racism of policies such as those behind the Windrush scandal. </p> <p>Patel dismissed Eshalomi’s concerns and implied that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/12/priti-patel-racism-home-secretary-blac"">her own experiences of racism </a>put her and the government of which she is part beyond any critique on grounds of racial injustice. Patel was denying that Eshalomi might have a different experience of racism than Patel – who, like me, is a relatively privileged middle-class woman of East African Asian descent – and arguing that her skin colour makes her immune to criticism about her politics in relation to racial justice. This is particularly offensive given the long history of anti-black racism among East African Asians with which Patel will be familiar.</p> <p>In lumping together black and Asian people in an amorphous group assumed to have a common experience of racism, O’Brien ends up reinforcing the very idea he wants to challenge: that someone’s identity must define their politics. The very act of assuming that all Asian or black people who criticise the politics of another Asian or black person do so out of bad faith and racism reinforces the hateful idea that you cannot criticise another Asian or black person’s politics because of some twisted notion of “solidarity”. It is offensive and dangerous, not least because a woman like Naz Shah has faced <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/27/battle-to-become-west-midlands-mayor-has-revived-memories-of-clan-rivalry-and-misogyny"">toxic misogyny </a>from Asian men within her own community, and has been depicted as a race traitor by some on the left for calling it out. Are Asian women only allowed to call out misogyny and racism from within our own communities when a white man tells us it is OK to do so?</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Are Asian women only allowed to call out racism and misogyny in our communities when a white man says it is OK to do so?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are parallels with how some lesbians have been denounced as bigots and deluged with rape threats for their views about gender and biological sex. Transgender people and lesbians are two groups that face hatred and discrimination, and differences of opinion exist within these groups. Some trans people and lesbians believe that being a woman has nothing to do with biological sex; others believe they are related, because female reproductive biology is the basis on which women have always faced structural oppression. Both perspectives have a right to be heard. Yet lesbians who believe the latter – many of whom have faced lesbophobia their entire lives – are facing persecution for their beliefs.</p> <p>Take Julie Bindel, an important feminist voice whose decades of campaigning against male violence have made a material difference to women’s lives. Last week, an Australian bookshop issued an <a href=""https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bookshop-forced-to-apologise-for-hosting-feminist-in-2018-3zhst8s7f"">apology </a>for “any hurt caused” by hosting an event with Bindel three years ago. They did not even have the guts to say what is offensive about Bindel, but it’s fair to assume they were referring to her views on gender.</p> <p>Or Allison Bailey, the barrister suing her chambers and the LGBT charity Stonewall for employment discrimination. Bailey is a black, working-class lesbian and a survivor of child sex abuse who believes, as many women do, that there should be some exceptions to males being admitted to female-only spaces. After she tweeted about a group she helped found for people who are same-sex attracted, Stonewall filed a complaint to her chambers and warned that its relationship with them would be damaged unless her chambers took disciplinary action against her.</p> <p>On Friday, a <a href=""https://allisonbailey.co.uk/updates/update-4/"">judge ruled that Bailey’s case </a>has “more than reasonable prospects of success” and should advance to trial. That a gay rights charity stands accused of discriminating against a black lesbian illustrates how wrong it is to assume the rights and interests of all LGBTQ+ people perfectly align. Of course, that has not stopped white men telling Bailey that her concept of womanhood is not only wrong, it makes her a bigot.</p> <p>Solidarity between oppressed groups is a powerful weapon for change, but it does not come automatically: it comes through listening to others and through finding common ground. As East African Asians know to our shame, the oppressed can be willing agents in the oppression of others.</p> <p>Be wary of the white, straight men who call out lesbians and women of colour as bigots because they refuse to comply with the version of liberation they deem appropriate, and who pat themselves on the back for being an “ally” for doing so. Their naivety gives them the luxury of childishly dividing the world into goodies and baddies.

It took a little more than 20 minutes for him to die. He had been sentenced to death after he was convicted of killing seven people in Virginia in 1992 as a part of the drug trade.</p> <p>When asked if he had any last words, Johnson appeared distracted, focusing on a room to his left designated for members of his family. Still glancing around, he responded: “No. I’m OK.”</p> <p>Seconds later, he said softly while gazing intently at the same room: “Love you.”</p> <p>After the execution, his lawyers released Johnson’s last statement. In it, he apologized.</p> <p>“I want to say that I am sorry for my crimes,” he said. “I wanted to say that to the families who were victimized by my actions.” He also said he wanted his victims’ names to be remembered.</p> <p>He also said the pizza and strawberry shake he ate and drank before the execution “were wonderful” but he didn’t get the jelly-filled doughnuts he wanted. He added: “This should be fixed.”</p> <p>Johnson’s execution and Friday’s scheduled execution of Dustin Higgs are the last before next week’s inauguration of Joe Biden, who opposes the federal death penalty and has signaled he’ll end its use. Both inmates contracted Covid-19 and won temporary stays of execution this week for that reason, only for higher courts to vacate those stays.</p> <p>Lawyers have previously argued the pentobarbital injections cause flash pulmonary edema, where fluid rapidly fills the lungs, sparking sensations akin to drowning. The new claim was that fluid would rush into the inmates’ Covid-damaged lungs immediately while they were still conscious.</p> <p>Johnson was implicated in one of the worst bursts of gang violence Richmond had ever seen, with 11 people killed in a 45-day period. He and two other members of the Newtowne gang were sentenced to death under a federal law that targets large-scale drug traffickers.</p> <p>Johnson’s lawyers described a traumatic childhood in which he was physically abused by his drug-addicted mother and her boyfriends, abandoned at age 13, then shuffled between residential and institutional facilities until he aged out of the foster care system. They said he could read and write at an elementary school level.</p> <p>In a statement, Johnson’s lawyers, Donald Salzman and Ronald Tabak, said the government executed a person “with an intellectual disability, in stark violation of the constitution and federal law” and vehemently denied he had the mental capacity to be a so-called drug kingpin.</p> <p>“We wish also to say that the fact Corey Johnson should never have been executed cannot diminish the pain and loss experienced by the families of the victims in this case,” the statement said. “We wish them peace and healing.”</p> <p>Prosecutors, however, said Johnson had not shown that he was disabled.</p> <p>“While rejecting that he has intellectual disabilities that preclude his death sentences, courts have repeatedly and correctly concluded that Johnson’s seven murders were planned to advance his drug trafficking and were not impulsive acts by someone incapable of making calculated judgments, and are therefore eligible for the death penalty,” prosecutors argued in court documents.</p> <p>CTWoody Jr, the lead homicide detective on the case, said that during his interrogations of Johnson, he denied any involvement in the killings and said police were trying to frame him because of lies people were telling about him.</p> <p>“It did not seem to me that he had any kind of mental problems at all except his viciousness and no respect for human life – none whatsoever,” Woody said.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this article.</em",False,pillar/news,News,"['honor killing', 'woman+murder']"

He added: “In my new position as archbishop of York it is absolutely essential that I am open and transparent about the need for the whole of our church to be scrupulously honest with each other about any failings in safeguarding.”</p> <p>Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, said Cottrell “clearly should have informed the authorities and made fuller notes of what he did in this case. He has shown humility in immediately admitting he failed to act as he should have done in this case.”</p> <p>The disclosure of Cottrell’s shortcomings in the case is a blow to the C of E, which has worked to rebuild trust on safeguarding issues after decades of convictions and allegations of physical, sexual, psychological and emotional abuse, and their cover-up by church leaders.</p> <p>Welby has repeatedly apologised to survivors for abuse carried out by clergy and has pledged to implement the recommendations of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse when it publishes its report on its investigations into the church, expected next year.</p> <p>Concerns about the way Cottrell handled the abuse disclosure were raised with the church’s national safeguarding team (NST) this year. The NST investigated the matter, took independent legal advice and interviewed Cottrell.</p> <p>In a statement, the NST said: “The concerns raised were about the action taken following allegations of domestic abuse perpetrated by a parish priest. At the time Bishop Stephen responded to the survivor, offered support and subsequently referred the allegation within the diocese, but did not ensure the matter was referred to the statutory authorities or directly to the diocesan safeguarding adviser.”</p> <p>Cottrell had “shown insight and humility in accepting that he failed to act as he should have done in relation to a serious matter … The NST investigation concluded that he posed no current risk of not responding appropriately to safeguarding disclosures and that informal action was a reasonable and proportionate response to the case.”</p> <p>Cottrell said: “Ten years ago I was approached about a safeguarding allegation regarding a priest. I was able to see the survivor and begin to hear what was a difficult and harrowing story.</p> <p>“However, I was moving between roles at the time and although I did speak with colleagues about the actions that needed to be taken, I failed to ensure that these were properly documented and followed through in the way I would expect. Now that I have discovered that this incident was not followed up as it should have been, I am deeply distressed and extremely sorry …</p> <p>“In the past, the Church of England has been too quick to protect its own reputation and slow to admit its failings.

She had toiled in them for half her life, writing most of her 11 novels and two nonfiction books in her time off. Even after becoming a bestselling author (<em>Konb</em><em>ini Ningen,</em> or <em><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/07/convenience-store-woman-sayaka-murata-review"">Convenience Store Woman</a>,</em> sold 1.4m copies and has been translated into 30 languages), she continued to work behind the counter until the attentions of an obsessive fan forced her to stop. “I was so used to the rhythm of working that I found it hard to hang around all day writing,” she explains.</p> <p>The novel’s oddball title character, Keiko Furukura, also relishes the predictable rhythms of her workplace. Japan’s 55,000 nearly identical convenience stores are considered stop-gap employers for job-hoppers, students, housewives and immigrants, “all losers”, says one of the characters in her book contemptuously. But Keiko, who is 36, a virgin and uninterested in the bourgeois lives of her married peers, excels at the pliant, robotic service demanded by the industry’s manuals. So unsettled is she by invasive questions about her lack of a husband and children that she takes in a lazy, abusive lodger just to deflect them.</p> <p>Reviewers were naturally intrigued by the similarities between character and author. Murata is also single and returns home in the evenings to her laptop and a menagerie of what she calls “imaginary friends”. She, too, struggled to meet her family’s expectations, growing up in a conservative home outside Tokyo (her father was a district court judge) “lonely and terribly shy”. Keiko lives in a sort of Kafkaesque nightmare of standing out, of causing offence, and mimics others to blend in, echoing Murata’s own detached childhood.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>I thought, when I was this age, women and men would be equal, but that’s not how it has worked out</p> <footer> <cite>Sayaka Murata</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“I used to find ways to not anger my friends by trying to find the right words,” she says during an interview at her publisher’s office in Tokyo. “In some way I felt like I didn’t have a will until I began writing, aged 10. It was the only place I could be selfish and express myself; where I could liberate myself emotionally.” While at university she took a job at a store near her home, finding her novelist’s voice later in prose that is as flat and unsparing as the fluorescent light of a nighttime<em> konb</em><em>ini</em>. Yet, she is no Keiko, she says. “She is strong willed and doesn’t care what people think – that’s not me at all.” Murata admires Keiko’s ability to resist social pressures: “To me she is a hero.”</p> <p>Expectations are high, then, for Murata’s latest novel. <em>Earthlings</em> tells the story of Natsuki, a friendless girl on the edge of puberty who believes she is a stranded alien in a society, or “factory”, where people are bred and become “components”. Sexually abused by a teacher, she cannot turn to her family: her mother angrily dismisses her claims and calls her “ugly and useless”. It’s a very literal depiction of childhood alienation, with the factory a metaphor for the social traps – marriage, work, children – waiting in adulthood. But Natsuki finds a soulmate in her sensitive cousin Yuu, also 11, who is from a troubled home. They are caught having sex during a family holiday after “marrying” and pledging to “survive” the factory – and their furious families ban them from meeting again.</p> <p>Sex in Murata’s writing is seldom untroubled or pleasurable. Later Natsuki posts an advert for a marriage partner to “escape family surveillance”, stipulating “no physical contact beyond a handshake”. Her eventual “husband” is repelled even by the thought of female touch. Asexuality and celibacy are common themes for Murata. <em>Shōmetsu sekai</em> (<em>Dwindling World</em>), written in 2015, posits a society where, as in Woody Allen’s <em>Sleeper</em>, procreation is performed artificially. In “<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/02/opinion/future-sex-society.html"">The Future of Sex Lives in All of Us</a>”, a piece she wrote last year for the New York Times, she imagines a time when sex doesn’t exist at all, and where she might enjoy a sexual relationship with a “fictitious being that lived within a story.” A character in one of her short stories falls in love and has sex with a convenience store.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""9bf512870193d7c83af84a5cfbcb1b1e54efa9ba""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/9bf512870193d7c83af84a5cfbcb1b1e54efa9ba/0_237_4724_2835/1000.jpg"" alt=""‘I hate food and cooking – I keep a vase on top of my cooker.’ Sayaka Murata."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">‘I hate food and cooking – I keep a vase on top of my cooker.’ Sayaka Murata.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Kentaro Takahashi/New York Times/Redux/eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Murata says her view of sexuality was shaped partly by finding her older brother’s collection of erotic books as a child. The objectification of women there shocked her. “It was all about male pleasure,” she recalls. Her brother was put under a lot of pressure to follow the family tradition, to become a doctor or judge, she says, while she was groomed for marriage. “It was a strict, old-fashioned house: I was told I was a girl so I should learn how to cook or something. It was just the way people thought in the countryside then. The expectations were all on my older brother. It looked really hard to be him – I’d have gone crazy.”</p> <p>In her teens and twenties, she tried embracing conventional notions of womanhood just to avoid what she calls “social harassment” before abandoning it in disgust. “I pretended to act the way I thought a cute woman should act, with an excess of femininity, but it was a horrible experience. I felt like I’d lost my will,” she says. In a relationship with a convenience store manager 15 years her senior, she found she was expected to cook morning and evening and do his washing. “It felt like being physically and mentally exploited. I mean, I hate food and cooking – I keep a vase on top of my cooker,” she says, laughing.</p> <p>Japan has changed since Murata was a girl. More than three million<a href=""http://www.gender.go.jp/english_contents/pr_act/pub/pamphlet/women-and-men19/index.html""> women have joined the workforce</a> in the past decade; more than two-thirds of women work and they are on the whole better educated than their male counterparts. A record <a href=""https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/338/"">68%</a> of both sexes feel no need to marry. Yet men still cling firmly to the citadels of economic and political power. Women make up just 1% of senior managers, about 4% of boardroom directors and <a href=""https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/07/asia/japan-female-politicians-intl/index.html"">10% </a>of the politicians in Japan’s lower house. Murata’s writing exists on the fault line of these social changes. In her 2014 novel <em>Satsujin Shussan</em> (<em>The Birth Murder</em>), bureaucrats have solved Japan’s declining birthrate by giving men artificial uteruses and allowing both sexes to kill one person if they successfully reproduce 10. </p> <p>Now 42, Murata’s decision to reject the life of her friends seems prescient. “I was shocked when I was in university and people told me I had to search for a rich marriage partner and think about having children. If that’s all university was for, what was the point of getting qualifications? I looked at my friends and wondered what to do. Society seemed against us.” Her married friends now depend on their husbands because jobs for women rarely pay enough to raise children, she says. If the marriage falls apart, they are trapped. “I thought when I was this age women and men would be equal, but that’s not how it has worked out.”</p> <p>For someone who professes timidity, Murata’s writing is unflinching when pitched against misogyny. The description of Natsuki’s abuse is horrifyingly vivid. There are also moments of pitch-black humour: watching her sister try to soothe her baby, Keiko glances at a knife and muses: “If it were just a matter of making him quiet, it’d be easy enough.” </p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/novel-sayaka-murata-convenience-store-woman"">I thought I was too different to see myself in a novel – but Sayaka Murata got me | Naoise Dolan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not surprisingly, perhaps, she says her parents don’t read her writing. Equally unsurprisingly, she is hugely popular with young people, especially women (Vogue Japan made her one of its women of the year in 2016). Many, she says, dread the thought of real relationships. Women have written or approached her tearfully at book events, unsettled by the graphic descriptions of Natsuki’s abuse. When Natsuki reaches college and plucks up the courage to tell her few women friends, she is told to get over her experience with her teacher. “I hate to be the one to say this, but he didn’t even force you to go all the way, did he?” says one.</p> <p>Murata says she starts with her characters and doesn’t know the ending of her novels until she writes them. That might explain why <em>Earthlings</em> turns from whimsy to surrealist horror. Its final act puts the three main characters – Natsuki, her first love, Yuu, and her fake husband - together in the mountainous Nagano countryside where their rejection of the “factory” becomes complete. Convinced they are aliens at war with the factory’s emissaries, they resort to murder and cannibalism. Munching on an “Earthling”, Natsuki finally recovers the sense of taste she lost as a result of the abuse. “I felt as though I was eating for the first time in twenty-three years.” Murata says she didn’t set out to write a shocking book but her subconscious invaded the pages. “The people who know me through <em>Convenience Store Woman</em> are disappointed. But I was a cult writer before that success. People are saying the old Murata has returned.”</p> <p>• <em>Earthlings, translated by Ginny Tapley Takemori from the Japanese book Chikyu Seijin, is published by Granta (£12.99).

On last year’s year-end Hot 100 chart, 65% of songs did not feature any women songwriters – the highest level of exclusion since the survey began in 2012.</p> <p>Women also remained woefully underrepresented as producers in 2020, making up just 2% of the 198 production credits on hit songs – compared with 5% a year prior, which was a high in the survey’s history.</p> <p>Representation dropped further among women of colour, with only Mariah Carey – as co-producer of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/11/mariah-carey-all-i-want-for-christmas-is-you-reaches-no-1-after-26-years"">All I Want for Christmas Is You</a> – credited with producing a song that made the 2020 Billboard Hot 100 year-end chart, albeit one first released in 1994.</p> <p>The USC Annenberg team looked further at the issue of colour in regard to producing. Picking a representative sample of 600 songs between 2012 and 2020, of 23 individual women credited as producers just seven were women of colour, resulting in an overall ratio of one woman of colour to every 180 male producers.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""412a30382cfb2d9c2836a178172febec5ef2f270""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/412a30382cfb2d9c2836a178172febec5ef2f270/0_330_2333_2333/1000.jpg"" alt=""Ariana Grande."" width=""1000"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Engineering change … Ariana Grande.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Dave Meyers/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2019, the Recording Academy, the body responsible for the Grammys, launched the <a href=""https://www.grammy.com/press-releases/recording-academy%E2%84%A2-task-force-diversity-and-inclusion-announces-industry-wide"">Women in the Mix pledge</a>, inviting anyone in the music industry responsible for hiring producers and engineers to commit to considering “a slate of candidates that includes at least two women” as part of its taskforce to address issues of inclusion.</p> <p>Of the 38 pledge-takers with a song on the Billboard Hot 100 year-end chart in 2020, none had worked with a woman producer (although they may have done on non-charting songs).

The footage showing a transit police officer firing into Grant’s back as he lay on the ground led to police accountability protests across the country. The case also gained international recognition in Ryan Coogler’s 2014 film <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/05/fruitvale-station-review-oscar-grant"">Fruitvale Station</a>, named after the site of Grant’s death.</p> <p>The Bay Area Rapid Transit (Bart) officer who shot Grant in the back, Johannes Mehserle, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in a rare criminal trial over a killing by law enforcement. He was sentenced to two years in prison and released in 2011.</p> <p>“It feels good, but we’re not holding our breath,” said Cephus “Uncle Bobby” X Johnson, Oscar Grant’s uncle, told the Guardian after the district attorney’s announcement. “We’ve been doing this for many years and we’ve seen the system break many hearts.”</p> <p>The Alameda county district attorney’s office originally charged Mehserle with murder, but the jury in Los Angeles – where the trial was moved, after Mehserle’s attorneys asked for a change of venue because of the case’s publicity in Oakland – found Mehserle guilty of the lesser charge.</p> <p>While Mehserle cannot be tried again for the same crime, prosecutors can look at the role other officers at the scene played in Grant’s killing. Grant’s family and community activists have called for the case to be re-examined.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/01/breonna-taylor-black-women-history-progress"">These days, having hope as a Black woman can be hard.

We should not have to wait another 11 years,” said the Rev Wanda Johnson, Grant’s mother, during a Monday press conference in front of the train station.</p> <p>“If our judicial system continues to not honor their word then we will continue to be out here and remind the world of how our judicial system is continuing to fail people of color,” Johnson continued.</p> <p>“We have listened closely to the requests of the family of Oscar Grant,” Nancy O’Malley, Alameda county district attorney, said in a statement on Monday. “I have assigned a team of lawyers to look back into the circumstances that caused the death of Oscar Grant. We will evaluate the evidence and the law, including the applicable law at the time and the statute of limitations, and make a determination.”</p> <p>A <a href=""https://www.ktvu.com/news/report-describes-bart-police-as-seriously-deficient-after-oscar-grant-shooting"">report released last year</a> under a new California police transparency law disclosed that another transit officer on scene that night had<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/02/officer-punched-oscar-grant-and-lied-about-facts-in-2009-killing-records-show""> repeatedly lied to investigators</a> and had punched Grant without justification. That Bart officer, Anthony Pirone, “started a cascade of events that ultimately led to the shooting”, including calling Grant the N-word while detaining him and hitting him in the face, according to the report.</p> <p>The report also cast doubt on <a href=""https://www.kqed.org/news/11744106/bart-releases-report-with-new-details-of-officers-roles-in-oscar-grant-killing"">Mehserle’s argument</a> that he meant to draw his Taser and not his gun, noting that “enhanced video” suggested Mehserle was “intending to pull his firearm and not his Taser”.</p> <p>Johnson says that his family has been waiting for the DA’s office to charge Pirone since Mehserle’s conviction. And after the 2019 report, combined with the fallout over the death of George Floyd, the family decided “it was time”.</p> <p>“There would be no killing of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor if we paid attention to what happened to Oscar in 2009,” Johnson said. “Now this reopening is a whole new flashpoint that will reverberate all across this nation.”</p> <p>Adante Pointer, an attorney for Grant’s family, said while he was happy that the district attorney was reopening the investigation, he questioned why it took her more than decade – and calls from the community and national protests around police killings – to take action. While murder charges have no time limit, lesser charges such assault, assault with a deadly weapon, or battery all have statutes of limitations that have most likely run out in this case, Pointer said.</p> <p>“Is this political theater or is this serious criminal prosecution that is being considered?” he asked. “Any good lawyer would know that many of the charges that could have easily been brought have ostensibly now been swept away by the sands of time. She once again sat on her hands until the community demanded action.”<br",False,pillar/news,News,['honor killing']

This painter risked all to challenge the man who raped her, and spent the rest of her career unpacking power struggles between the sexes on her canvases.</p> <p>She is Artemisia Gentileschi (1593-c.1656) and, next month, the National Gallery is mounting the <a href=""https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/artemisia?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3ubL2-f05wIVg7HtCh25zgfyEAAYASAAEgK7xPD_BwE"" title="""">first major exhibition of her work in the UK</a>. As has happened with many female artists, Gentileschi’s paintings were ignored and wrongly attributed for centuries. Just last week, a <a href=""https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/newly-attributed-artemisia-gentileschi-painting-revealed-in-london"" title="""">previously misattributed painting believed to be by her was unveiled in London</a>, a city where she once lived and worked.</p> <p>When the canvas, <em>David and Goliath</em>, was sold at Sotheby’s in 1975, it was believed to be by Giovanni Francesco Guerrieri, a student of Gentileschi’s father, Orazio. “It’s common for women’s work to be wrongly attributed to male artists,” said Palmyre Manivet of Simon Gillespie Studio in London, where the work was restored.</p> <p>Last week, art scholar Gianni Papi, writing in the <em>Burlington </em>magazine, suggested the painting could be from the collection of King Charles I. Art historian Horace Walpole noted in 1762 that this collection included “several of her [Artemisia Gentileschi’s] works,” and that “her best was David with the head of Goliath”.</p> <p>The painting, which was found on cleaning to have the signature “Artemisia” on David’s sword, was recatalogued after being put up for sale again in 2018 in Munich. According to Papi, the giveaways included a wealth of rich colours typical of Gentileschi. Simon Gillespie, meanwhile, calls it “a genius piece”, adding that the sleeve and landscape details, and the way that light falls on David’s face, are further indications of its new-found genesis.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>In Judith Beheading Holofernes, she\'s imagining, as a woman, what it would take to decapitate a muscular man</p> <footer> <cite>Letizia Treves, curator</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The National Gallery exhibition will bring not only Gentileschi’s paintings, but also her story, into sharp focus. Her mother died in childbirth when her only daughter was just 12. Her father, a successful artist and a friend of Caravaggio, was perhaps surprised when he realised that his talents had passed not to his three sons but to his daughter. At the time, women were not allowed to become members of the all-important artistic guilds or the academies, but Artemisia would go on to become the first female member of the Accademia in Florence in 1616.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Orazio encouraged Artemisia, and being the daughter of an artist meant she could access what most young women could never hope for – training. It meant, too, that she got to know Caravaggio’s work, which would prove pivotal to her output.</p> <p>But she also met an artist called Agostino Tassi, who worked alongside her father and, when she was 17, raped her. When Tassi refused to marry her, Orazio took him to court.</p> <p>In the trial that followed, Artemisia, the victim – rather than Tassi, the perpetrator – <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jul/06/national-gallery-buys-artemisia-gentileschi-masterpiece-for-36m"" title="""">was tortured to ascertain if she was telling the truth</a>. “It is true.

It won the second of its three awards for best adaptation.</p> <p>Caroline Fourest, a filmmaker, author and columnist at Marianne magazine, said the César judges had rewarded “Polanski and not his work … as well as a 100% masculine film”.</p> <p> Earlier in the day France’s culture minister entered the row saying that to give the controversial director a César would send the wrong signals.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""a094bef53e9b54f4c01b895013bfae5688472aaf""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/a094bef53e9b54f4c01b895013bfae5688472aaf/0_323_4928_2957/1000.jpg"" alt=""Activists gather outside the location of the Césars awards to protest against the nominations of Roman Polanski’s film."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Activists gather outside the location of the Césars awards to protest against the nominations of Roman Polanski’s film.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Aurélien Meunier/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Franck Riester’s comments came hours after Polanski, 87, said he would not attend Friday’s awards ceremony for fear of being subject <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/27/roman-polanski-pulls-out-of-cesar-awards-an-officer-and-a-spy"">to a “public lynching”</a> by feminists.</p> <p>Women’s rights activists are furious the judges gave the director’s latest film numerous nominations.</p> <p>“It’s for each judge to take responsibility. It would be a bad symbol given the necessary awareness we all need to have in the fight against sexual and gender-based violence,” Riester told France Info radio on Friday.</p> <p>Polanski’s film, called An Officer and a Spy in English after the Robert Harris novel about the Dreyfus affair, won two prizes at the Venice film festival, including best director.</p> <p>“Fantasies of unhealthy minds are now treated as proven facts,” Polanski said in a statement on Thursday. “We know how this evening will play out.”</p> <p>This latest case has relaunched the debate over Polanski’s place in French – and world – cinema, and whether his work can or should be regarded as separate from the man.</p> <p>Earlier, protestors sprayed anti-Polanski graffiti outside the venue and the headquarters of the French film academy, the Académie des Césars.</p> <p>Adèle Haenel, the star of Portrait de la Jeune Fille en Feu (Portrait of a Lady on Fire), which has also been nominated for several Césars, warned she would boycott the event if Polanski attended. She has accused another French director, Christophe Ruggia, of sexually harassing her when she was 12.</p> <p>“Distinguishing Polanski is spitting in the face of all victims,” Haenel told the New York Times, adding that nominating him “means raping women isn’t that bad”.</p> <p>“There is a #MeToo paradox in France: it is one of the countries where the movement was the most closely followed on social media, but from a political perspective and in cultural spheres, France has completely missed the boat.” She said France had failed to draw the line between “libertine behaviour” and “sexual abuse”.</p> <p>The renewed controversy came weeks after the academy <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/14/leadership-of-french-oscars-resigns-amid-polanski-controversy"">resigned en masse</a>. Alain Terzian, its president, had defended the decision to honour Polanski’s film, saying it was not the institution’s role to take “a moral stance” when it came to awards. An open letter signed by more than 200 actors, producers and directors had demanded “profound reform” of the academy, saying it was stuck in the past and criticising its lack of transparency.</p> <p>The French feminist group Osez le Féminisme (Dare to be Feminist) accused the Césars committee of being a “sexist institution that makes women invisible”.</p> <p>Marlène Schiappa, France’s equality minister, suggested French cinema was still behind the times and had “yet to complete its awakening, its revolution”.</p> <p>It is not the first time anger and protests centred on Polanski have disrupted the Césars. In 2017, Polanski was named to preside over the awards ceremony but stepped down after a wave of outrage.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 3 March 2020 because an earlier version misnamed the French minister for equality, Marlène Schiappa, as Marlène Schiapparelli.

He has never spoken to professionals during his two years in custody on the advice of his legal team, meaning the true scale of his offending remains unclear.</p> <p>While the police investigation continues, the worldwide coverage of the case has prompted a flood of male victims to contact helplines about sexual abuse they have suffered – many breaking their silence after decades.</p> <p>The charity <a href=""https://www.safeline.org.uk/"">Safeline</a> said it had seen a 500% increase in calls to its national hotline for male survivors of sexual abuse since Sinaga’s sentencing on Monday – the biggest rise in its history.</p> <p>Neil Henderson, its chief executive, said the huge increase in contacts this week compared with a 300-400% rise following the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/25/sexual-abuse-football-andy-woodward-football-association"">football abuse scandal in 2016</a>.</p> <p>Survivors Manchester, the charity supporting several of Sinaga’s victims, said it had also experienced a rise in the number of people seeking help, from an average of two a day usually to 57 new referrals between Monday and Friday morning.</p> <p>Duncan Craig, its founder, described the case as a “watershed moment” for the perception of male rape. He said it had bust “the myth” that rape only happened to gay men and started a national conversation about men opening up about sexual abuse.</p> <p>“What it’s done inadvertently is open a window of opportunity to male survivors which they’re now jumping through,” he said.</p> <p>Craig, a trained therapist, said there now needed to be a wider discussion about how night-time safety campaigns were always aimed at women, when they applied equally to men.</p> <p>“The whole world effectively is talking about how it’s possible for men to be raped, how we need to talk about safety and rethink messaging,” he said. “When pubs and clubs and alcohol campaigns are often talking about be careful of your drink it’s always aimed at women, but maybe we need to start having a wider conversation.”</p> <p>Sinaga posed as a “good samaritan” to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/06/reynhard-sinaga-serial-rapist-posed-good-samaritan-lure-men"">lure his intoxicated victims</a> back to his flat in Manchester city centre, where he would spike their drink and sexually abuse them when they passed out, filming the whole encounter on two mobile phones.

Trump’s four-year-long Iranian vendetta is approaching a climax – and he still has the power and the means to inflict lasting damage.</p> <p>Speculation that Trump might soon initiate or support some kind of attack on Iran, overt or covert, kinetic or cyber, had swirled across the Middle East in the wake of last weekend’s unprecedented meeting in Saudi Arabia between Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.</p> <p>What the three men discussed <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/23/benjamin-netanyahu-secret-meeting-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman"" title="""">remains a closely guarded secret</a>, a fact that has only served to encourage conspiracy claims. In the absence of an official statement, it’s suggested they may have agreed to intensify efforts to provoke and weaken the Tehran regime. Any ensuing retaliation by Iran might then potentially be used to justify an attack on its nuclear facilities before Trump leaves office on 20 January.</p> <p>The meeting in Neom, a city near the Red Sea, and the possibly deliberate leak revealing it had taken place, served another important purpose. By presenting a united anti-Iran front, the participants put US president-elect Joe Biden on notice that his plans to resume dialogue with Tehran, and revive the 2015 nuclear deal abandoned by Trump, will face fierce resistance and may have to be rethought.</p> <p>If Iran hits back over the assassination, as threatened by its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Biden’s hopes of calming the regional situation could be blown apart – along with Iran’s nuclear facilities at Natanz and elsewhere. And there’s another danger. Even if the regime holds back, loyalist Shia militias in Iraq, Syria or Lebanon could take matters into their own hands.</p> <p>“We will strike as thunder at the killers of this oppressed martyr and will make them regret their action,” Hossein Dehghan, a senior military commander, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/27/mohsen-fakhrizadeh-iranian-nuclear-scientist-reportedly-shot-dead-near-tehran"" title="""">vowed in a tweet</a>. Yet Iran’s dilemma is excruciating. If it does retaliate in any obvious way, it could give its enemies the excuse they want and the opportunity they crave to deliver a crushing blow.</p> <p>Iran’s leaders have little doubt that Israel, with a probable green light from Washington, was behind the assassination. President Hassan Rouhani <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/28/iran-president-blames-israel-for-scientist-killing-and-vows-nuclear-progress-will-continue"" title="""">expressly blamed the “usurper Zionist regime”</a>. Foreign minister Javad Zarif tweeted that there were “serious indications” of an Israeli role. “Iran calls on international community – and especially EU – to end their shameful double standards &amp; condemn this act of state terror,” he wrote.</p> <p>The methods used to kill the scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who was gunned down in a street near Tehran, resembled those used in a spate of similar killings of nuclear experts between 2010 and 2012 that Iran blamed on Israel. In 2018, Netanyahu singled out Fakhrizadeh as Iran’s supposed nuclear weapons mastermind.</p> <p>The assassination also recalled last January’s lethal ambush of General Qassem Suleimani, the Iranian Islamic revolutionary guard corps commander, which was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/baghdad-airport-iraq-attack-deaths-iran-us-tensions"" title="""">personally ordered by Trump</a>. While Suleimani was regarded as a national hero, Fakhrizadeh was also a man of high seniority. For Iran, his death is a body blow.</p> <p>Trump has shown himself ready to use covert means to punish the Iranian regime, which he accuses of secretly developing nuclear weapons and destabilising the Middle East – claims Iran adamantly denies. The US and Israel are believed to have launched repeated sabotage attacks inside Iran on Trump’s watch.</p> <p>In July, the Natanz nuclear fuel enrichment facilities were damaged by a mysterious explosion. This month, Trump reportedly discussed options for hitting Natanz and other targets after UN inspectors said Iran’s low-enriched uranium stockpile was <a href=""https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/11/irans-low-enriched-uranium-stockpile-12-times-beyond-limits-un"" title="""">now 12 times higher</a> than permitted under the 2015 nuclear deal abandoned by Trump.</p> <p>For still undisclosed reasons, Trump ordered several nuclear-capable B-52 Stratofortress bombers to fly 7,000 miles to the Middle East last weekend.</p> <p>Was the assassination a one-off designed to damage Iran’s nuclear programme? Or could all this be a prelude to something more strategically explosive as Trump strives to secure his wished-for legacy as scourge of Iran and saviour of Israel?</p> <p>Trump certainly needs a win. His Iran policy to date has mostly resulted in own goals. His “maximum pressure” sanctions campaign hurt the Iranian people but left their leaders unbowed. The regime is now closer to acquiring nuclear bomb-making capability than it would have been had Trump not reneged on the nuclear deal.</p> <p>Yet what happens next also depends, up to a point, on Israel and Saudi Arabia. Netanyahu and Prince Mohammed are keen to send a message to Biden that what they characterise as appeasement of Iran will not work. If the nuclear deal is to be resurrected, they want loopholes plugged and new elements added. Meanwhile, they say sanctions on Iran should continue.</p> <p>But both men must tread carefully. Netanyahu cannot ignore Biden’s views or the impact expanding hostilities could have on Israel’s security. As for the crown prince, he would doubtless like to see Iran given a bloody nose. But he, too, has to ponder the cost of turning Saudi cities and oil terminals into targets. For them, the assassination represents a high-risk gamble.</p> <p>Iran’s leaders must now decide whether to resist the urge to retaliate – or lash out and invite a larger conflict at a moment when the country’s sanctions and Covid-hit economy is on its knees. It’s a fateful moment for the entire Middle East. Full of brooding malevolence, Trump is waiting to pounce. After four years of failure, he may be tempted to go out with a bang.",False,pillar/opinion,Opinion,['honor killing']

It’s not possible that we will pass through there and not remember.”</p> <p>A wave of protests which erupted across Nigeria against the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/11/nigeria-to-disband-sars-police-unit-accused-of-killings-and-brutality"" title="""">now officially disbanded Sars police unit,</a> and more generally against police brutality, have met the brutality they hoped could finally end. At several protests, police units have responded with force, and groups of young men wielding knives and sticks have attacked demonstrators. “It doesn’t make sense,” said Oyodele. “We were only demanding that they stop harassing and killing us but they still responded by doing even worse.”</p> <p>More than 56 people have died since demonstrations began in Nigeria more than two weeks ago, Amnesty International has said. “End Sars” – a predominantly online campaign against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars), a police unit, plagued by a history of extra-judicial killings, torture and extortion – flooded on to the streets in early October. In a country where peaceful protest is often repressed, demonstrations were met with further acts of violence by police officials.</p> <p>The cries for change in Nigeria, largely from a younger generation in a country where young people are the largest demographic, have been met with a lack of urgency, bemusement and threats of force by a generation of elderly governing officials, led by the 77-year-old president, Muhammadu Buhari. For much of the past few weeks the president has cut an aloof figure, silent as outrage in the country grew following abuses against protests across the country. On Thursday after widespread international criticism of the killings and his response, he failed to directly mention the fatal shootings or order an investigation.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""ddd944523f8da4190f464346790e1b9e00dab197""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/ddd944523f8da4190f464346790e1b9e00dab197/47_118_3437_2062/1000.jpg"" alt=""Shoppers return to a marketplace as Lagos eases the curfew imposed after protests"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Shoppers return to a marketplace as Lagos eases the curfew imposed after protests.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Temilade Adelaja/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Calling for an end to the demonstrations he warned protesters to “resist the temptation of being used by subversive elements to cause chaos”.</p> <p>The <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/20/nigeria-protests-lead-to-24-hour-lagos-curfew"" title="""">shootings in Lagos by security officials on Tuesday</a> left the country and many around the world aghast. Footage posted after the events and broadcast live on social media showed soldiers firing live rounds into fleeing protesters at the tollgate in the more affluent Lekki area of Lagos. After the killings, the army denied any of its soldiers were even at the scene, claiming footage of the killings was manipulated. Lagos’ governor said there were no casualties.</p> <p>After the killings at the tollgate Oyodele lay on the ground, felled by a body covered in blood as he was running from police. When officers sped past him, pursuing other protesters, he fled into a nearby bush, and waited for hours as bullets rang into the air. Nigeria’s authorities had announced a number of policies in recent weeks to placate the protesters and reform the police, yet the attacks by security forces and groups of thugs on protests was their clearest response to their demands, he said. “They would rather send guns on us than put in place real measures or make real changes,” he said.</p>  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive element--supporting"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/10/archive-zip/giv-39025vUXkzFEvDVB/"" data-alt=""Map of Lagos and Nigeria""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/10/archive-zip/giv-39025vUXkzFEvDVB/"">Map of Lagos and Nigeria</a> </figure>  <p>In recent years, President Buhari’s government has made numerous promises to reform, overhaul or disband Sars. On 12 October in response to the growing protests he announced the unit would be dissolved. The reforms are the most comprehensive announced by his government, a measure of the pressure the protest movement has forced. Yet a widespread sense they do not go far enough has fuelled dismay at the government.</p> <p>“There is a generational issue,” said Chioma Agwuegbo an activist. “Nigeria has the highest demographic of young people in Africa. Young people are making fair demands but in some of the statements by government officials you can see they’re still being dismissive.”</p> <p>The shock of the killings has left the protest movement reeling. Twenty-four-hour curfews adopted by many states are slowly easing but have effectively shut down the protests. Yet anger is simmering and could prompt fresh demonstrations.</p> <p>The protests have offered a sense of new possibilities for a younger generation frustrated with poor governance in Africa’s most populous country. They have given rise to an ecosystem of support groups, coordinating help and providing logistics across the country.</p> <p>Feminist Coalition, a group of young women, and the End Sars Response team were just two such groups. They set up phone lines for protesters, provided medical aid for the injured, and organised ambulances and private security at protests across the country.</p> <p>For Ariet Honest, a 23-year-old artist and model, marching to end Sars has been her first protest, driven by several occasions where she was searched and harassed by police. “It’s inspiring to see our power, our unity,” she said. “We’re not even asking them for much. Just stop killing and harassing us, that’s all.”",False,pillar/news,News,['honor killing']

Guardian Sport is also <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/apr/29/social-media-boycott-campaign-against-hate-online-guardian"">adding its support to the campaign</a>.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/apr/29/social-media-boycott-campaign-against-hate-online-guardian"">Guardian Sport joins social media boycott in campaign against hate online</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking in the buildup to this weekend’s Portuguese Grand Prix in Portimão, Hamilton said personal experience gave the initiative particular resonance. “I was subject to abuse a long, long time ago, at a time when I was younger, when I was reading social media, trying to engage with people,” he said. “I took a period of time when I stepped back. I generally don’t go searching for that stuff, I don’t feel like I need validation.</p> <p>“I do believe the social media companies need to do more. They are able to take steps in helping to create a more anti-racist society, that is what we have to be pushing towards. I am proud to hear so many organisations are getting involved, I’m not sure why F1 is not a part of that, but I know people like Sky are and I will follow and support this weekend.”</p> <p>Hamilton was an <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/17/lewis-hamilton-george-floyd-f1-record-championships-greatest-driver-racism"">outspoken supporter of the Black Lives Matter</a> movement last season after the death of George Floyd and became a strident activist promoting anti-racism in F1. He has committed to continue to push to make the sport more diverse and to encourage greater action in combating racism.</p> <p>The boycott – inaugurated last Saturday by the Professional Footballers’ Association, the Kick It Out anti-racism campaign and the Football Supporters’ Association – came in reaction to some high-profile racist abuse online including the Liverpool players Trent Alexander-Arnold, Naby Keïta and Sadio Mané and Aston Villa’s Tyrone Mings. It has since gathered huge momentum. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/apr/11/cricket-stuart-broad-social-media-boycott-england"">Stuart Broad has cited the racist abuse</a> his England teammate Jofra Archer was subject to last year and Hamilton believed F1, too, still had a long way to go in combating the problem.</p> <p>“Clearly in sport, racism continues to be an issue,” he said. “Social media platforms do need to do more in order to combat this so I am fully supportive of the initiative. If me also doing it helps putting pressure on those platforms in order to help fight against it then I am happy to do so.”</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/apr/29/major-sports-bodies-84-hour-social-media-boycott-over-online-abuse-facebook-twitter"">Major sports bodies to start 84-hour social media boycott over online abuse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is understood F1 is not joining the boycott because the sport does not suffer an abuse problem on social media. They offer support but will not be formally joining the boycott, stating: “We continue to work with all platforms and our own audiences to promote respect and positive values and put a stop to racism.”</p> <p>The boycott – led initially by English football and now joined by English cricket, Premiership rugby, the Lawn Tennis Association and Sky Sports television – will take place from 3pm on Friday through to 11.59pm on Monday. All social media accounts including those of players, teams and organisations will fall silent in an attempt to make Twitter, Instagram and Facebook act against racism and abuse.</p> <p>Hamilton’s contract at Mercedes lasts until the end of this season and he has yet to make it clear he will continue in the sport. However in Portugal he gave the clearest indication yet that he will do so, citing his desire to continue pursuing equality and diversity as a strong motivation to keep racing.</p> <p>He said he had recently taken part in a Pirelli tyre test because “I plan to be here next year”, a statement he expanded upon, saying he believed he could still instigate change while driving in F1.</p> <p>“It’s encouraging to see the steps my team are making toward becoming more inclusive and more diverse. We still have a lot of work to do as a sport, there are still many teams that have continued to stay silent, and people that have not been held accountable. There is still a lot to do in this sport and I know that being in it I have more chance of helping change that than not.

She must have been more worried about the health of the child inside her than about her own hunger,” said Krishnan.</p> <p>Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan confirmed that an investigation was being carried out into the elephant’s death, and that one arrest had been made.</p> <p>“We want to assure you that your concerns will not go in vain. Justice will prevail,” tweeted Vijayan.</p> <p>Kerala Forest Department meanwhile pledged that it would “leave no stone unturned to ensure max punishment to the offenders”.</p> <p>News of the elephant’s cruel demise prompted over 2 million people across the world to sign petitions demanding justice for her death, and everyone from Bollywood stars to politicians and powerful business CEOs to speak out. Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar called the death of the elephant “heartbreaking, inhumane and unacceptable”.</p> <p>However, the issue took another nasty turn after it was co-opted by rightwing Hindu nationalists, who blamed a Muslim community for deliberately carrying out the killing.</p> <p>Maneka Gandhi, a member of the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), alleged that the elephant had been killed in Malappuram district, which has a 70% Muslim population, despite it being over 50 miles west from River Velliyar in Palakkad where she actually died.</p> <p>“It’s murder,” said Gandhi, who is a prominent animal rights activist. “Malappuram is famous for such incidents, it’s India’s most violent district. For instance, they throw poison on roads so that 300-400 birds and dogs die at one time.”</p> <p>Though India is a secular country, since the election of the BJP government led by Narendra Modi in 2014, the persecution of the country’s 200 million Muslims has become rife, and is often stoked by BJP leaders and politicians pushing a Hindu nationalist agenda. The state of Kerala however is governed by the opposition Communist Party of India (Marxist).</p> <p>Gandhi’s comments prompted chief minister Vijayan to condemn those who had “used this tragedy to unleash a hate campaign. Lies built upon inaccurate descriptions and half truths were employed to obliterate the truth. Some even tried to import bigotry into the narrative”.</p> <p>A police complaint was also made against Gandhi for allegedly stoking a hate campaign.</p> <p>Data from the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change shows over the past five years, 490 elephants in India died due to unnatural causes, such as electrocution, poaching and poisoning.",False,pillar/news,News,['honor killing']

It had also called for the “remigration” of refugees at European level and called for a political doctrine of “national preference” in France.</p> <p>The group encouraged members to wear uniforms and used paramilitary rhetoric and symbolism – including the image of Joan of Arc brandishing a kalashnikov – it noted.</p> <p>The decree also accused Génération Identitaire of being open about its stated aim of “entering into war against all those who want to tear us from our roots and make us forget who we are” and that it ran a boxing club next to its headquarters to train members in combat and self-defence.</p> <p>Génération Identitaire has carried out several high-profile actions to block migrants from entering France.

And just as Bridget gets a nannying job for two women, Maya (Charin Alvarez) and Annie (Lily Mojekwu), looking after their infant daughter Frances (Ramona Edith-Williams), she discovers that she’s pregnant from her relationship with Jace. Unsure whether he’s the one, Bridget makes a calm and rational decision. This moment is arrived at without any great storm clouds of unhappiness, as it might be in a sterner “social issue” movie, and Bridget carries on with her life, which involves increasing intimacy with Frances and her formidable, difficult parents – and we are left to ponder the symbolism of this parallel.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/22/babyteeth-review-"">Babyteeth review – Eliza Scanlen stars in a shattering, refreshing and achey coming-of-age film</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She even has a fling with a conceited musician, because she doesn’t consider herself exclusive with Jace.

The Commission noted that both “supported young people and their families to make informed decisions” and “had a good understanding of Gillick Competence and applied this proportionately when obtaining consent from young people.”. </p> <p>Last month, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/dec/03/puberty-blockers-ruling-curbing-trans-rights-or-a-victory-for-common-sense-"">transgender teenagers told the Guardian of their own frustrations at lengthy waiting times</a> for initial appointments.</p> <p>The service has faced major scrutiny in recent years, with some former staff and campaigners raising concerns about the “overdiagnosing” of gender dysphoria, the consequences of early medical interventions and the significant increase in referrals of girls questioning their gender identity.</p> <p>Inspectors found there were more than 4,600 young people on the GIDS waiting list, with some waiting over two years for their first appointment. GIDS has previously estimated an average of 18 months waiting time from referral. The report warned that the size of the waiting list meant staff were unable to proactively manage the risks to those on it, many of whom were vulnerable and reported self-harming behaviours.</p> <p>Inspectors also found that staff were dealing with heavy caseloads, with a third of staff having caseloads working with over 60 individuals at once.</p> <p>Concluding that the service was “not consistently well led”, the inspectors also reported staff did not always feel respected, supported and valued, while some said they felt unable to raise concerns without fear of retribution.</p> <p>However, feedback from young people and families being seen at the service was overwhelmingly positive about the care and support provided, while the report also noted that staff referred young people to other providers for medical treatments that were consistent with good practice.</p> <p>How staff recorded their work was also scrutinised: the report found that the competency, capacity and consent of patients referred for medical treatment was not consistently recorded before January 2020. The report also stated that staff did not develop holistic care plans for young people, nor did they fully record the reasons for their clinical decisions in case notes.</p> <p>“There were significant variations in the clinical approach of professionals in the team and it was not possible to clearly understand from the records why these decisions had been made,” the report says.</p> <p>Kevin Cleary, the commission’s deputy chief inspector of hospitals, said the GIDS would be subject to further inspection: “We were extremely clear that there were improvements needed in providing person-centred care, capacity and consent, safe care and treatment, and governance.</p> <p>“In addition vulnerable, young people were not having their needs met as they were waiting too long for treatment. The action we took was one way of ensuring the trust was tackling these issues in a way which allowed other healthcare partners to support if necessary.”</p> <p>The report comes the day after<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/19/high-court-grants-leave-to-appeal-to-uk-gender-identity-service""> the NHS trust was given leave to appeal</a> against a ruling by the high court in the case of Keira Bell, which barred it from referring under-16s for puberty-blocking treatment.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Tavistock apologised to patients for the length of time they are waiting to be seen, and said the GIDS was ready to agree a full action plan with the commission.</p> <p>“Above all, we remain focused on providing a high quality service to children and young people in our care and supporting our staff who, despite the challenging context they have been working in, have been praised by the CQC for their understanding, compassion and kindness. Patient feedback was reported as overwhelmingly positive and we will involve both patient and staff as we build on these strengths.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 20 January 2021 to add details about the CQC review of the GIDS endocrinology services at UCLH and Leeds Children’s Hospital.",False,pillar/news,News,['gender-based violence']

The two women then did it together, breathing slowly and intentionally in sync.</p> <p>Breathwork is one of the tools that Douthit, 56, often reaches for when soothing clients. But this time, instead of sitting in the same room inhaling the same air, the women breathed together on Zoom.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/25/pregnant-during-coronavirus-pandemic-how-will-it-affect-me-and-my-baby"">Pregnant in a pandemic: how will coronavirus affect me and my baby?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It’s devastating, right? I mean, you built this relationship, you fall in love with these people, you get excited about working with them, and then suddenly, you can’t,” she told me.</p> <p>As Covid-19 changes the way <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/25/pregnant-during-coronavirus-pandemic-how-will-it-affect-me-and-my-baby"">women experience pregnancy</a>, doulas like Douthit are caught between a calling to guide their clients through childbirth and the limitations caused by the pandemic. Many hospitals across the country now limit visitors to just the mother-to-be and her partner in the delivery room, meaning doulas, who are recognized by hospitals only as visitors, are forced to support births virtually or not at all. Some are organizing and pushing back on hospital policies that exclude them from delivery rooms, but therein lies an ethical question: at what point does advocating for recognition and respect outweigh the risks of exposing others to the virus as non-medical visitors in a hospital? It’s a debate saddled with historical tension between doulas and the western obstetrical healthcare system.</p> <p>For now, doulas are hastily translating their intimate and hands-on work on to impersonal virtual platforms, and preparing their clients for giving birth without them physically present. “We’re trying to scramble to give support in a different way, and learn a new skill set really quickly,” says Raychel Franzen, a New York-based doula. “I think one of the things that a doula brings to their clients is a calm energy. We can still do that with facial expressions on a video call, but the energy exchange is just a little bit different.”</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>You built this relationship, you fall in love with these people, you get excited about working with them, and then suddenly, you can’t</p> <footer> <cite>Robin Douthit</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gwynne Knap, an Atlanta-based doula, is also a faculty member of Childbirth and Postpartum Professional Association (Cappa), one of a few organizations nationwide that certifies doulas. Recently, Knap’s work has revolved around teaching fellow doulas how to shift their offerings to reflect the circumstances – Cappa has developed <a href=""https://cappa.net/2020/03/17/supporting-labor-clients-during-covid-19-pandemic/"">resources and suggestions</a> for doulas to support their clients virtually, such as having the woman’s partner wear an earbud, the doula coaching through contractions over the phone. But some techniques used by birth workers to calm and comfort women during labor, like hand-holding and eye contact, are impossible to translate. “A labor doula helps the mom a lot with comfort and suggested positions, but she also calms the partner so they can be more emotionally present,” says Knap. “When the doula’s not there, it’s very hard to do that.”</p> <p>While some doulas have shifted to virtual support, others are pushing back against the new hospital policies and argue that hospitals shouldn’t lump doulas in as regular “visitors”, but rather as critical to ensure the mother’s health. These doulas, along with birth advocacy groups, are organizing virtual town halls to strategize a unified pushback, circulating petitions against individual hospital policies, and distributing scripts for doulas to use when speaking to hospital administrators about the potentially harmful implications of restricting doulas from labor units. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B910K_hgUkK/"">In some cases</a>, that advocacy has resulted in hospitals adjusting their visitor policy to allow doulas, in addition to a partner or support person, on the labor floor.</p> <p>“It’s not a bonus or a luxury for someone to have care that is safe and respectful,” says Cristen Pascucci, founder of Birth Monopoly, an online advocacy organization that focuses on birthing rights. They argue that for some patients, doulas are an essential part of ensuring a healthy, safe birth – especially for marginalized populations like women of color, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/black-maternal-mortality-babies-san-francisco-crisis"">particularly black women</a>, who bear the brunt of the maternal mortality crisis in America. There is <a href=""https://www.cochrane.org/CD003766/PREG_continuous-support-women-during-childbirth"">evidence</a> that continuous, one-on-one birthing support, particularly from a doula, reduces the risk of dissatisfying or traumatic birth experiences, unplanned C-sections and low Apgar scores – the method physicians use to assess a newborn’s health immediately after birth.</p> <p>“There are people who, I feel comfortable saying, <em>have</em> to have a doula to have a safe birth,” Pascucci says. For women of color and low-income women, who statistically face bias from healthcare workers, and who suffer higher maternal mortality rates and worse birth outcomes as a result, a doula can act as a crucial mediator. Many doulas work closely with their clients to inform them about their rights as patients, and talk through the questions they can ask their providers about interventions before they happen.</p> <p>Some doulas also incorporate trauma-informed practices to mitigate the risk of a traumatic birth for more vulnerable women. “For a rape survivor who doesn’t have a partner [with her], a doula is like a lifeline,” says Pascucci.</p> <p>She adds: “Doulas have been quietly filling in the gaps of the maternity care system for years and years. Now we have a crisis and the same system that doulas have been making up for, the first chance it got, was like, we still don’t know what you do and we still don’t appreciate you. So all of those gaps that doulas were filling are back.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html"" data-alt=""divider""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html"">divider</a> </figure>  <p><strong>In mid-March,</strong> the Association of Women’s Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) released a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/AWHONN/photos/a.440709733800/10157817317008801/?type=3&amp;theater&amp;hc_location=ufi&amp;comment_id=Y29tbWVudDoyNTU3MDA2NDA0NTUwNjM5XzI1NTcwMDg0Mjc4ODM3NzA%3D"">statement</a> in support of allowing doulas into the delivery room. AWHONN member Shirley Picard, who is both a doula and a nurse in Rhode Island, spearheaded that effort. “I felt it was important as a registered nurse, birth doula and nursing leader that women have their designated labor support companions be at their bedside as planned,” she says. “I also know that it’s been difficult for doulas to advocate for themselves within the hospital infrastructure, hence why I felt it was important for AWHONN to be a leader here.”</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Doulas have been quietly filling in the gaps of the maternity care system for years and years</p> <footer> <cite>Cristen Pascucci</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For other nurses working on the frontlines, it’s a tough call. One labor and delivery nurse in New Orleans, who asked to remain anonymous out of concern for her job, understands that she can never replace the role of a doula in the delivery room. “Doulas provide an excellent service in that one-on-one care,” she says. “As a nurse, I can’t be in there to get you through every contraction.”</p> <p>Her hospital’s labor and delivery unit, which previously had minimal restrictions on non-patient visitors, now only allows one support person a patient, and only when they’re actively in labor. (A patient kept overnight for blood pressure monitoring, for example, cannot have any visitors.) She has had to field frantic phone calls from women asking for their doula to be allowed in, only to tell them no. “I think it’s thrown a lot of women – this is their plan, and everything has been thrown off,” she says. “I think about how scary that must be.”</p> <p>On the other hand, she works in a city <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/26/new-orleans-surviving-katrina-battles-covid-19-coronavirus"">besieged by the virus</a>.

She’d heard he used to wave to another neighbor on his daily runs.</p> \n<p>It should just have been another ordinary run for the 25-year-old Arbery back in February. But a series of events unfolded that ended in his brutal killing at the hands of two white men, which has caused anger across America and especially among black Americans and campaigners for social justice.</p> \n<p>Now, as Bennett watches the video of how his last run through her neighborhood ended in his death, she cries.</p> \n<p>That sorrow – and rage – has spread through Georgia and the rest of the US, and has reignited a long-running debate over the killings of young black men by white people. It was sparked by a 36-second video released online months after that late February run – a video that shed new light on how Arbery was killed. In the film, an unidentified person in a car films Arbery jogging towards a white truck parked on the road, where two men stand: one in the bed of the truck and another just to its side.</p> \n<p>One shot rings out as Arbery disappears off camera, swerving around the truck. Another shot rings out as Arbery struggles back into frame as yet another shot is heard.

The two have spoken about what happened to Arbery. When Stewart first heard what happened, he thought to himself, “I jog and I live in a predominantly white neighborhood now.

She said they began messaging – including “sexual and flirtatious” video calls – until she was 18, when Milosh, then 35, invited her to visit him in Berlin. She accused him of pressuring her into sex after she initially resisted, saying: “I did not respect my no and neither did he,” and then claims he forced her to perform sex acts that she resisted.</p> <p>Their relationship continued, and she and Milosh married when she was 19. She has accused Milosh, who is Canadian, of using the marriage to get a US visa, and of financial exploitation, physical assault and gaslighting. She has also accused him of recording her saying “no” during sex and using a sample of that in Rhye song. The couple divorced, with Nikolas accusing Milosh of bullying behaviour during their mediation. Nikolas concluded: “To this day, I still suffer PTSD from that relationship, even doubting my own sanity on some days.”</p> <p>Milosh released a statement denying Nikolas’s claims, calling them “a piece of revisionist fiction”. He said he is “fully prepared to cooperate with any independent investigation”.</p> <p>He added: “I have always wished her nothing but the best and continued to support her financially even after I was no longer required to under our divorce agreement. Eventually, I stopped paying [and] in response, Alexa has resorted to character assassination.”</p> <p>Nikolas responded to the statement, saying Milosh was “denying the truth”.</p> <p>Milosh is a critically acclaimed and successful musician, with hundreds of millions of online streams of his muted R&amp;B music. He began releasing recordings as Rhye in 2013, initially as a duo with producer Robin Hannibal for the debut album Woman. Milosh has released three further albums as Rhye, adding to three solo albums under his own name.</p> <p>Nikolas’s acting career began in childhood, notably with a main role on the Nickelodeon TV series Zoey 101.

Anyone who writes for a living on the internet has surely fantasised about payback time for all the keyboard warriors, callous below-the-liners and unrepentant trolls out there. Ivo van Aart’s movie gives full rein to that desire and is snappily directed – but in the end there is something self-satisfied and sententious about his feminist revenge flick.</p> <p>Katja Herbers plays Femke Boot, a newspaper columnist drowning in internet misogyny, especially after she steps out of her usual lifestyle remit to write an op-ed about <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/15/will-dutch-library-ban-on-black-pete-books-spell-end-for-racist-christmas-tradition"">Zwarte Piet</a>, the Dutch blackface folkloric character. Her book publisher is pressurising her for juicier material to better compete with author-of-the-hour Steven Dood (Steven Death), a kohl-rimmed provocateur who savages her on a chatshow.

And when Femke ends up in bed with Dood, it turns out his gothic bad boy persona is just a pose, and he is actually keeper material. These aspects hover soberly around the themes of free expression and online identities – but dilute the black comedy Van Aart attempts to operate with elsewhere.</p> <p>There is some nice absurdist carnage, such as middle-class mum Femke creeping along a gutter to tip a neighbour off the roof in her inaugural murder. But the humour isn’t sharpened to a fine point, leaving each new death to bludgeon in The Columnist’s thesis with the blunt end: online life has robbed us of the ability to appreciate nuance and difference. Femke’s graduation to monster lacks the delicious irony it’s shooting for, as a few plot-logic slips en route – why leave uncleaned weapons around for others to discover? – betray Van Aart’s haste to get his opinion out there. </p> <p>• The Columnist is released on 12 March on digital platforms.",False,pillar/arts,Arts,['woman+murder']

Morrison has argued all week that he only became aware of the rape allegations on Monday, and his staff were only aware on 12 February – an account that omits the fact one member of the prime minister’s staff was aware of the incident because she had previously worked for Reynolds.</p> <p>On Friday, Morrison said his advice about the knowledge of his staff remained unchanged, but he had asked his department secretary, Phil Gaetjens, to verify any contacts between his staff and Higgins. “I would like to know, if there was anything different here, I would like to know,” the prime minister said.</p> <p>Higgins said when she spoke to police at Parliament House on 27 March they already seemed to have information about events on the night of the alleged assault. “They were filling in blanks for me,” she said, which made it “a strange” but supportive conversation at a traumatic time.</p> <p>But she said when her complaint went to the sexual assault and child abuse team in Belconnen, police there conveyed the impression there was stonewalling from parliamentary officials about handing over relevant material.</p> <p>Higgins said the police officer she dealt with in Belconnen told her the unit was already in the process of acquiring footage from venues she attended on the night of the alleged assault. But she said she was “getting pushback” after “reaching out to Parliament House”. “She didn’t seem surprised by that,” Higgins said.</p> <p>Asked when the relevant incident reports were provided to police, the Department of Parliamentary Services initially told Guardian Australia “in April 2019”.</p> <p>When asked to supply the precise date, a DPS spokesperson said: “All relevant reports of the incident were provided to the AFP at their request on 7 April 2019.”</p> <p>In a separate statement, the DPS said it informed the Senate president, Scott Ryan, in late March that there had been an incident in Reynolds’ office. The speaker, Tony Smith, was told on 8 April.</p> <p>Ryan and Smith were informed by DPS on 8 April that the AFP had made a request to view the CCTV footage. The security vision was viewed at Parliament House on 16 April.</p> <p>Higgins withdrew her police complaint on 13 April.

Some of the allegations went to a cleanup of Reynolds’ suite on 23 March and whether a potential crime scene had been tampered with.</p> <p>After police concluded there had been no disclosures of a potential sexual assault to either parliamentary security or DPS before the cleaning was authorised, the finding was the actions taken “were not in response to a suspected crime”.</p> <p>A second investigation was then carried out by former federal security inspector general Vivienne Thom. According to the DPS statement, the conclusion of this inquiry was the evidence did not substantiate claims that incident reports had been amended, or that a senior DPS official instructed the building security division to have the suite cleaned.</p> <p>More details have also emerged about the post-politics employment of the alleged perpetrator.</p> <p>Higgins said she had no knowledge of whether her former colleague resigned or was dismissed on 26 March after a conversation with the chief of staff about the events of the evening of 22 March.</p> <p>She told Guardian Australia that he went “quietly”. As he packed up his desk “heads were down in the office”. Higgins said that was a reflection of “staffer culture”.</p> <p>“No one asked questions,” she said.

A lot more. This holds true over time and across cultures. In America, the incarceration capital of the world (more than 2 million detainees), males comprise 93% of the prison population. Men also account for 73% of all arrests and 80% of those charged with violent crimes. This disparity between the sexes is particularly stark when it comes to murder: 90% of the time, the ones who do the killing are men.</p> <p>All these numbers add up to what criminologists call the “gender gap”. But read enough academic journals and government crime reports, and some curious facts emerge: while crime rates in the western world have steadily declined over the past three decades, the number of young women being convicted for violent crimes in some western countries has increased significantly; law enforcement records indicate the opposite is true for their male counterparts. In other words, the gender gap is closing.</p> <p>In some UK cities, the number of female arrests <a href=""https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/number-female-arrests-has-risen-50-per-cent-will-police-learn/"">increased by 50%</a> from 2015 to 2016. That’s more than a blip. A 2017 <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/women-prisoners-rise-prison-around-the-world-institute-criminal-policy-research-birkbeck-a8044811.html"">report</a> by the Institute For Criminal Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London came up with this sobering data point: the global female prison population has surged by more than half since the turn of the century, while the male prison population increased by just a fifth over that same period. Women and girls may account for only 7% of all incarcerated people today, but their numbers are now growing at a much faster rate than at any time in recorded history.</p>  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive element--supporting"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Strange%20sins&amp;description=In%20a%20new%20column%2C%20Rene%20Chun%20goes%20inside%20the%20world%20of%20crimes%20committed%20by%20unusual%20suspects%20%0A&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fseries%2Fstrange-sins&amp;links=true&amp;link-1-headline=Dodgy%20diplomats%3A%20how%20envoys%20misuse%20their%20immunity&amp;link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2019%2Fdec%2F02%2Fenvoys-diplomatic-immunity-misuse-crime&amp;link-2-headline=Rich%20robbers%3A%20why%20do%20wealthy%20people%20shoplift%3F&amp;link-2-url=theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2019%2Fnov%2F04%2Fwealthy-people-shoplift-rob-steal-why&amp;link-3-headline=Botox%20break-ins%3A%20why%20are%20thefts%20of%20the%20beauty%20drug%20on%20the%20rise%3F&amp;link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2019%2Foct%2F07%2Fbotox-theft-breaking-bad-cosmetic-surgery"" data-alt=""series links""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Strange%20sins&description=In%20a%20new%20column%2C%20Rene%20Chun%20goes%20inside%20the%20world%20of%20crimes%20committed%20by%20unusual%20suspects%20%0A&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fseries%2Fstrange-sins&links=true&link-1-headline=Dodgy%20diplomats%3A%20how%20envoys%20misuse%20their%20immunity&link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2019%2Fdec%2F02%2Fenvoys-diplomatic-immunity-misuse-crime&link-2-headline=Rich%20robbers%3A%20why%20do%20wealthy%20people%20shoplift%3F&link-2-url=theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2019%2Fnov%2F04%2Fwealthy-people-shoplift-rob-steal-why&link-3-headline=Botox%20break-ins%3A%20why%20are%20thefts%20of%20the%20beauty%20drug%20on%20the%20rise%3F&link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2019%2Foct%2F07%2Fbotox-theft-breaking-bad-cosmetic-surgery"">series links</a> </figure>  <p>Kelly Paxton, a Portland, Oregon-based private investigator known as the <a href=""https://pinkcollarcrime.com/about-kelly"">Pink-Collar Crime Lady</a>, says she isn’t surprised that female arrest rates are going up: “Women suddenly have the financial pressures that men have had for decades. They’re the breadwinners in 40% of all households. If these women can’t pay the bills, some will resort to committing crimes.”</p> <p>The new crime trend hasn’t gone unnoticed. The National Herald ran this story last month: Greek cops nab teen girl pickpocket ring in Athens. And here’s a recent BBC News headline: Sharp rise in women caught carrying knives (up 73% in the past five years). Even InSight Crime, a not-for-profit that studies organized crime in Latin America and the Caribbean, is all-in. One of their recent reports sounds like a Netflix elevator pitch: female prisoners in Venezuela become cell block bosses to survive.</p> <p>What’s really cemented this pulpy women-behind-bars image in the collective conscious, though, is Crime Has No Gender, a controversial Europol <a href=""https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/crime-has-no-gender-meet-europe%E2%80%99s-most-wanted-female-fugitives"">campaign</a> that launched last August. “Are women equally capable of committing serious crimes as men?” reads the news release. “The female fugitives featured on Europe’s Most Wanted website prove that they are.”</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Are women equally capable of committing serious crimes as men? The female fugitives featured on Europe\'s Most Wanted website prove that they are</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To show that women can be vicious sociopaths too, Europol asked 21 of the 28 EU member countries to select a single fugitive for their campaign. The methodology may have been flawed, and the sample size small, but the gimmick worked. The bad girls theme was reflected in the head count: <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/19/campaign-launched-to-catch-europes-most-wanted-women"">18 females</a>, three males. Elena Puzyrevich (Russia), who trafficked nine young women into Spain and forced them to work as prostitutes, made the list. So did Dorota Kazmierska (Poland), a 44-year-old femme fatale who killed her husband by shooting him in the head. Then there’s Zorka Rogic (Croatia), a blonde desperado who works in sales: narcotics, “psychotropic substances”, firearms, munitions and explosives.</p> <p>Documenting the rise in female crime is one thing. Explaining it is quite another. Cesare Lombroso, the Italian physician known as the “father of modern criminology” (he invented the first lie detector) also wrote the first book about women and crime, La Donna Delinquente, in 1893. He concluded that women who broke the law exhibited crude male traits. The profile was simple: short, lusty, vulgar and prone to wrinkles. They also had darker hair and smaller skulls than “normal” women. A Lombroso dating tip: beware of girls with prominent lower jaws – they’re likely to commit crimes of passion.</p> <p>Freud also thought criminal women were more like men. Sort of. He blamed female crime on a “masculinity complex”, which could be traced back to (of course) penis envy. Most women resolved this complex and developed into law-abiding citizens. Others, however, fared worse. Instead of embracing femininity, these women over-identified with males and coveted their floppy organs. Think of a woman who smiles while she stabs her husband to death in bed, and later cleans the sheets.</p> <p>Biology and psychology theories are still discussed in criminology classes today. Studies that link the menstrual cycle to female crime have persisted for decades. According to the three female authors of The Curse: A Cultural History of Menstruation, the 19th century axe murderer Lizzie Borden butchered her family because “her period coincided with an epileptic attack”. Psychology models, of course, continue to be popular. Behavioral theory suggests that becoming a criminal requires conditioning, a form of learning that involves positive reinforcement: rob a bank, spend the money, rob another bank.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>According to three female authors axe murderer Lizzie Borden butchered her family because ""her period coincided with an epileptic attack""</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Increasingly, though, many of today’s gender gap theories focus on external factors, like tougher drug sentencing laws (<a href=""https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/incarcerated-women-and-girls/"">25% of women</a> in US state prisons have been convicted of a drug offense, compared to 14% of male prisoners) and the proliferation of violent female gangs (the Bad Barbies, an all-girls “sister gang”, with chapters in Harlem and Brooklyn, have pulled off multiple revenge murders). There’s also the post-conviction barriers that uniquely affect women and lead to recidivism: prison guard abuse, few mental health services and a lack of job training. Police, lawyers and judges being less protective toward women is another reason criminologists believe the gender gap is shrinking.</p> <p>We should have seen this coming. In 1975, the famous criminologist Freda Adler trumpeted this warning in her bombshell book Sisters In Crime: The Rise of the New Female Criminal: “In the same way that women are demanding equal opportunity in the fields of legitimate endeavor, a similar number of determined women are forcing their way into the world of major crimes.”</p> <p>Forty-five years later, Adler’s feminist manifesto still resonates. Just try finding a criminologist who doesn’t own a dog-eared copy. Critics may argue that her prediction was wrong (the 70s women’s lib movement didn’t breed a vast army of females toting guns and flashing armpit hair), but Adler was onto something. More women <em>are </em>committing violent crimes. It just took longer than she expected.</p> <p>The most intriguing academic paper that explores the women behaving badly phenomenon is the 2015 article <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article/56/6/1272/2415129"">The Darker Side of Equality? The Declining Gender Gap in Crime</a>. Rejecting Adler’s gender equality theory, the authors offer a reverse hypothesis: the real reason that the gender gap is shrinking isn’t because women are copying the behavior of men and committing more crimes – it’s because men are copying the behavior of women and committing fewer crimes. The idea that feminism might be making our mean streets safer may sound absurd to a beat cop, but the theory is being hotly debated among criminologists and gender studies scholars at liberal arts colleges.</p> <p>The Pink-Collar Crime Lady has her own gender gap theory, and it doesn’t have anything to do with feminism, chivalrous judges or menstrual cycles. “Women nurture and raise us. We love and trust them,” explains Kelly Paxton. “So being a female crook is the perfect cover.” Then she shares some insider wisdom: “The first thing I tell clients is never underestimate a woman.

For post-riot-grrrl rock beast <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/sleater-kinney"">Sleater-Kinney</a>, that noise reached its peak with their fourth album, 1999’s The Hot Rock – their saddest, strangest record, and absolutely nobody’s idea of a commercial grab – likely because their reputation had built to the point that it became their first album to break the US Top 200.</p> <p>While its follow-up was not about to do battle with Britney and Christina for chart supremacy, All Hands on the Bad One is the Pacific Northwest trio’s most accessible record – poppy, surfy and possessed of utterly alluring girl-gang cool – and one where they use the idea of accessibility to subversive and provocative ends. They question their male peers (The Ballad of a Ladyman; Male Model), gatekeeping critics (The Professional) and culture at large about who gets to belong, and who sets those terms: in #1 Must Have, Corin Tucker appears to wail from amid thrashing waves about how girl power appropriated the feminist movement that forged her in Olympia, and laments the return of machismo to rock following Woodstock 99, where several women were gang-raped.</p> <p>Tucker and Carrie Brownstein share songwriting and vocal duties on every Sleater-Kinney record, but on AHOTBO, the spotlight thoroughly belongs to Tucker, showcasing her forlorn gospel vibrato (the remarkably prescient Was It a Lie?, about how real-life violence got turned into entertainment), cheeky pop agility (You’re No Rock’n’Roll Fun) and acid mockery (Youth Decay). This vigorous, hilarious, provocative record is not only their best, but an all-time rock great.</p> <h2>The three to check out next</h2> <p><strong>Dig Me Out (Kill Rock Stars, 1997)</strong></p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti1liRM6cao""                                                                        >  <iframe height=""259"" width=""460"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ti1liRM6cao?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Sleater Kinney: Dig Me Out – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It’s hard not to think that the arrival of Janet Weiss, the band’s drummer of 22 years, had something to do with Sleater-Kinney’s third album being their first great one. The beat throughout most of Dig Me Out is relentless, a kind of monomaniacally focused tunnelling that practically causes you to vibrate while listening. Weiss provides the skeleton for Tucker and Brownstein’s songwriting to become indelible, drawing on the pop rigour they dabbled in with I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone from the previous year’s Call the Doctor to write a fairly ridiculous amount of iconic songs. Little Babies and Words and Guitar tap into a similar power-pop vein (while smartly addressing the roles culturally pre- and proscribed for women), while lone ballad One More Hour documents the end of Tucker and Brownstein’s brief romantic relationship, an indie heartbreak anthem as devastating as Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ Maps.</p> <p><strong>The Woods (Sub Pop, 2005)</strong></p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZA_7FtttRY""                                                                        >  <iframe height=""259"" width=""460"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vZA_7FtttRY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Sleater-Kinney: Jumpers – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone, Words and Guitar, You’re No Rock’n’Roll Fun: Sleater-Kinney had been writing about their existence as rock stars outside of the traditional rock canon since practically day one. On The Woods, their first album for Sub Pop, they storm the barricades, employing Dave Fridmann to produce this steaming, swaggering hard-rock opus indebted to Hendrix and Zeppelin. On Entertain, Brownstein (for this time it’s her record) spits venom at a new wave of boys in bands content to dabble in post-punk cosplay: “Where’s the ‘fuck you’? Where’s the black and blue?” she screams. (Later in the song, Tucker’s “WUH UH OH!” rings out like the blinding flash that follows a nuclear explosion.) Sleater-Kinney’s homage is different: subverted not only by the fact that they’re women staging a sit-in of the canon, but by the incandescent fury of their songwriting, whether on The Fox – an allegory for Bush-era warmongering – or Modern Girl, Brownstein’s sweet-sour assessment of how society warps and mollifies female desire.</p> <p><strong>The Center Won’t Hold (Mom + Pop, 2019)</strong></p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5uAH0vNn2s""                                                                        >  <iframe height=""259"" width=""460"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E5uAH0vNn2s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Sleater-Kinney: Hurry on Home – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The unwitting centre of a storm, The Center Won’t Hold was made by a trio but released by a duo after Weiss quit during the album’s promotional cycle, citing divergent directions. The presence of St Vincent as producer, plus the encroachment of synthesisers and industrial textures into the band’s sound, stirred up another ridiculous debate about the authenticity of Tucker and Brownstein’s intentions for their ninth album. As the debacle recedes into the past, this epic, expansive record can stand on its own: Tucker’s songs, written in the midst of a depression following the loss of her day job and the state of the world, are her most desperate and forlorn since Sympathy, the coda to 2002’s One Beat about her premature son’s fight for survival; while Brownstein sounds savage, riled up (Hurry on Home) and broken (The Dog/The Body) by betrayals both personal and political.</p> <h2>One for the heads</h2> <p><strong>The Hot Rock (Kill Rock Stars, 1999)</strong></p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9MA4rFNf7I""                                                                        >  <iframe height=""259"" width=""460"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d9MA4rFNf7I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Sleater-Kinney: Get Up – video</figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/28/sleater-kinney-the-center-wont-hold-interview"">Sleater-Kinney: ‘Music has always been the playground of men’s sexuality’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Supremely underrated, The Hot Rock contains a few anguished punk ragers (Start Together, The End of You, Banned From the End of the World) but it’s the only Sleater-Kinney album primarily made up of softer, sadder songs. To enhance this hitherto underexplored side, they hired Roger Moutenot, best known for his work with Yo La Tengo, though the results were rarely straightforwardly comforting: Brownstein’s beautiful The Size of Our Love, featuring rare string augmentation, is as close as they get to plain-hearted yearning.

In 2009, Ritchie, an American woman living in Houston, Texas, took a trip to Karachi, the sprawling megacity in southern Pakistan. At the time, Pakistan <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jul/08/from-the-archives-karachi-vice-inside-the-city-torn-apart-by-killings-extortion-and-terrorism-podcast"" title="""">was beset</a> by terrorist violence, and the travel advice of most western countries could be summarised as “don’t go”. But Ritchie had been persuaded by friends who knew the city. “My Pakistani friends said: ‘Cynthia, you’ve travelled much of the world, but you haven’t been to Pakistan, why not come?’ I was like: ‘Sure, why not?’,” Ritchie told me.</p> <p>After a couple of weeks eating seafood and sightseeing, Ritchie went back to Houston, where she worked in communications and other roles for local government. The next year, she made a few more trips to Pakistan, funded by various Pakistani-American organisations. Houston is twinned with Karachi, and Ritchie told me that back then she “represented the city as an informal goodwill ambassador”. As foreigners in Pakistan often are, she was immediately offered exciting opportunities – working with local NGOs, advising the health department about social media, giving lectures. That year, she decided to move to Pakistan permanently. “I just felt a kinship here, that I belonged here and had a sense of purpose,” she said when we first spoke earlier this year. She settled in the leafy, relatively secure capital city, Islamabad, where most westerners in Pakistan – diplomats, journalists, aid workers – also lived.</p>  <p>Ritchie had no problem making friends and contacts. She has a supremely confident manner, and speaks as if she already knows that you’re going to agree with her. At first, she worked in development, consulting for government agencies and NGOs. A few years after moving, she started work on a documentary series that would showcase Pakistan’s natural beauty and cultural riches. Later, there would be some claims on social media that Pakistan’s powerful military had some involvement in the project, but Ritchie insists that it was entirely self-funded. In October 2015, she posted a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zwSidT-HFM"" title="""">short trailer</a> on her YouTube channel and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=818702788228216"" title="""">Facebook</a> page. “Living abroad, one often hears of Pakistan in myopic and prejudiced terms,” she announces in the voiceover. “But my time in Pakistan has taught me the world can be wrong about many things.” Over the next three-and-a-half minutes, we see shots of bustling markets, jagged mountain ranges, and Ritchie, a tall, attractive woman, in various street scenes – playing with children, driving a rickshaw. “Join me,” Ritchie says, “as we show a side of Pakistan rarely seen in the international media.”</p> <p>Ritchie didn’t have much of a following, but the video became a hit on Pakistani social media. To date, it has been watched more than 2m times. “I received overwhelmingly positive responses,” she said. Pakistan’s population has lived through two grim decades of political instability, terrorist violence and military crackdowns, and many people are acutely aware of their country’s negative image abroad. Ritchie’s video offered something different: here was an American who wasn’t focusing on grotesque scenes of urban violence, but the picture-postcard beauty of the Hunza valley and the glorious Mughal architecture of Lahore. “Some of the messages I got brought tears to my eyes,” Ritchie told me. “People were like: ‘I haven’t seen my country like this in years now. Thank you so much. I’m crying.’”</p> <p>There was a point, not very long ago, when the sheer fact of being a white tourist in Pakistan was enough to merit headlines. Glowing articles about Ritchie and her travels in Pakistan appeared on news websites, and her following on social media grew. Alongside this novelty factor, her path to fame was smoothed by what people on the subcontinent call the “gora complex”, a term that describes preferential treatment given to white people. (<em>Gora</em> means “white person” in Urdu.) “In Pakistan, nothing sells more than a white-skinned person,” says Ayesha Siddiqa, a Pakistani academic and author. “The colonial mindset is still there.”</p> <p>Ritchie’s documentary never materialised, but the trailer she posted in 2015 started a trend. In the last few years, Pakistan has become an unlikely destination for western social media influencers producing glossy, upbeat travel content. British Airways flights to Pakistan <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/british-airways-restarts-flights-to-pakistan#:~:text=British%20Airways%20direct%20flights%20restarted,in%20Islamabad%20at%2004%3A20."" title="""">resumed</a> in 2019, after a 10-year hiatus due to terrorist violence. At least in part because of the influx of YouTubers and Instagrammers, last year, Forbes listed Pakistan as one of its Top 10 “under the radar” holiday destinations for 2020, while Condé Nast Traveller <a href=""https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/best-holiday-destinations-2021"" title="""">ranked it No 1</a> overall. Under prime minister Imran Khan, the government has encouraged this trend, enthusiastically promoting tourism.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""6d8ca575d4ed78ce50659c7264eaf1c861da55f1""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/6d8ca575d4ed78ce50659c7264eaf1c861da55f1/0_347_5200_3120/1000.jpg"" alt=""Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Robert Preston/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While many Pakistanis felt pride at the international coverage, others looked on with bewilderment. During the same period that Pakistan has been promoted as an idyllic tourist destination, anyone presenting a more critical narrative has been muzzled. Scores of activists and protesters, including a sitting member of parliament, have been arrested for sedition. Senior leaders from the two main opposition parties – the Pakistan Peoples party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N) – have been arrested on corruption charges (some of them remain in custody).</p> <p>Meanwhile, the military, which directly ruled the country for roughly half of its 73-year history and retains control over foreign and security policy, has taken an increasingly active role in civilian government. To some, the tourism push felt like an attempt to distract attention from this crackdown and, as one Pakistani <a href=""http://new-pakistan.com/2019/04/02/baji-cynthia-ritchie-appears-on-stage-with-u-s-designated-global-terrorist/"" title="""">dissident blog</a> puts it, to argue that “Pakistan’s beautiful landscape and the hospitality and kindness of its people should somehow give it a pass over terrorism, nuclear irresponsibility, money laundering, lack of democracy and human rights”.</p> <p>White travel influencers, who often receive extraordinary privileges such as access to restricted areas and meetings with top officials, have been useful to a government trying to sell a new vision of the country – and the debate about their role has divided Pakistan. “The military wants to control the discourse,” I was told by Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to the US. “They want to shut down all dissenting voices.” To Haqqani, the influencers were part of the “discourse industry” that the government had promoted.</p> <p>In Ritchie’s case, this has developed into a major political scandal. Despite having no public profile in her home country, since her arrival in Pakistan, Ritchie has gained almost 290,000 followers on Twitter, and regularly appears on national television. In June, after months of increasingly combative public pronouncements in which she attacked Pakistani liberals, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=3012638535481275&amp;ref=watch_permalink"" title="""">Ritchie accused</a> a prominent opposition politician of rape, and two others from the same party of sexual assault. (All three men deny the allegations.) Her claims were front-page news. “Cynthia Ritchie’s accusations are bigger than Covid in Pakistan,” read <a href=""https://theprint.in/opinion/cynthia-ritchies-bigger-than-covid-in-pakistan-as-imran-khan-would-like/438876/"" title="""">one headline</a>. But rather than a #MeToo-style reckoning, the scandal has led to greater scrutiny of Ritchie herself.</p> <p>Her critics accuse her of being a propagandist for the military with a white saviour complex. Ritchie denies this: she sees herself as a clear-eyed truth-teller who has been unfairly persecuted for striving to build a bridge between Pakistan and the west. “Not everybody has understood what I’ve been trying to do for a number of years, and I understand that,” she told me. “For many it’s easier to just think I’ve been hired by the military to do this.” Later, she added grandly: “I do believe I was <em>meant</em> to affect a positive change relating to the western-Pakistan dynamic.” </p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Soon after Ritchie’s first video aired in 2015, American travel blogger Alex Reynolds and her then-boyfriend arrived in Pakistan as part of an overland trip around the world. “There were just no foreign tourists – I saw two in six weeks in Pakistan,” Reynolds told me. Dawn, the country’s oldest English-language newspaper, ran <a href=""https://images.dawn.com/news/1175844/meet-the-hiking-duo-that-took-a-chance-on-pakistan"" title="""">a story</a> about their trip headlined: “Meet the hiking duo who took a chance on Pakistan.”</p> <p>In the 60s, Pakistan was part of the legendary “<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/22/from-the-archive-on-the-hippy-trail-india-1971-observer"" title="""">hippy trail</a>” that stretched from Europe to Asia, but this virtually disappeared after Gen Zia ul-Haq seized power in the 70s and began a programme of Islamisation. The trickle of international tourism that continued through the 80s and 90s finally dried up after 9/11 and the US invasion of Afghanistan, as westerners became a target for local branches of the Taliban and al-Qaeda. Even within Pakistan, domestic tourism slowed to a halt, given the safety risks: since 2001, around 65,000 people in Pakistan <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1444744"" title="""">have been killed</a> in terrorist attacks or anti-terror military operations.</p> <p>By 2016, when Reynolds arrived, it was much safer. An army-led operation that began a couple of years earlier had drastically reduced terrorist and political violence. But it was difficult to find clear advice about travelling around the country. On her blog, she collated practical information about visas and transport, and soon she began to get queries from other western travellers. Some were other content creators – including those, like Reynolds, who describe themselves as “adventure tourists”, seeking out unusual, sometimes dangerous destinations to visit.</p> <p>One of these aspiring travel vloggers was Eva zu Beck, a young Polish-born woman who had recently quit her job working for a travel startup in London. In April 2018, Zu Beck visited Gilgit-Baltistan, a beautiful mountainous region of Pakistan scattered with aquamarine lakes and majestic pine trees, parts of which are inhabited by polytheistic tribal communities. When she returned to Pakistan later in the year, Zu Beck posted vlogs to YouTube from Pakistan’s major cities. Her follower count grew exponentially, driven mainly by viewers within Pakistan. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=225401214809474"" title="""">One video</a> she posted to Facebook in August 2018 has been viewed 1.5m times.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""bf8a9e65efa9a93a925404331419826f49340c6f""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/bf8a9e65efa9a93a925404331419826f49340c6f/305_0_1535_921/1000.jpg"" alt=""Alex Reynolds visiting Gilgit-Balitistan in 2019."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Alex Reynolds visiting Gilgit-Balitistan in 2019.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Lost With Purpose</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I was getting a lot of views from people who seemed to be surprised by the fact that their own country was so beautiful,” Zu Beck told me. She was interviewed on Pakistani TV about her travels, and within months she was being recognised on the street as she walked around Islamabad. “It was totally overwhelming,” she said.</p> <p>Others in the adventure tourism world began to show an interest in Pakistan. In 2019, Rosie Gabrielle, a Canadian Instagrammer and YouTuber began a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2334101616804023"" title="""">solo motorcycling tour</a> of the country, quickly gaining hundreds of thousands of followers. Big-name travel influencers, such as the Food Ranger (4.66 million YouTube subscribers) and Drew Binsky (2.01 million YouTube subscribers) were also joining the scramble. One of Binsky’s videos, which celebrated the country’s hospitality culture, showed him trying to pay for things at market stalls and in restaurants and being rebuffed. The title of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWeWxl7ruGE"" title="""">video</a> was “Why is everything free in Pakistan?” He concluded that “The people of Pakistan are incredibly joyful. They’re laid-back, they don’t stress much, they don’t care about living in a nice house or driving a fancy car, they are just living a happy life and that’s all there is to it!”</p> <p>The rise of the travel influencers made some Pakistanis uncomfortable. Pakistan had been a British colony within living memory, and until very recently, most western coverage had been negative. Now western travellers had decided Pakistan was worth visiting, and were being treated like saviours. In November 2018, around the time Zu Beck was becoming famous, a photo of Ritchie appeared online and ignited a <a href=""https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/394519-us-blogger-eulogized-for-riding-bike-in-peshawar-twitter-appalled-at-the-hypocrisy"" title="""">furious debate</a> on Twitter and on Pakistan’s op-ed pages. The photo showed Ritchie riding a bike in Peshawar, a city in north-western Pakistan where, as elsewhere in the country, women are normally forbidden from cycling because it is seen as immodest.</p> <p>Why was it, critics asked, that a white American woman was enjoying privileges denied to Pakistani women? And why was a white American woman promoting such an absurdly misleading picture of Pakistan? “The colonisers might have exited this country decades ago, but our need to seek validation from them still hasn’t left our veins,” tweeted the feminist collective <a href=""https://twitter.com/girlsatdhabas/status/1062741569076453377"" title="""">Girls at Dhabas</a>. At the time, Ritchie defended herself <a href=""https://twitter.com/CynthiaDRitchie/status/1062604249098534912"" title="""">by saying</a> she wanted to “to encourage a sense of normalcy, promoting peace &amp; progress in Pakistan”. When I asked Ritchie about the controversy, she dismissed it as “a complete lie”. She pointed out that the “photo” was actually a screenshot from her 2015 documentary trailer. She had never denied that the scene was staged, she said. It had been misrepresented by people who had “decided to write a fake article” about her.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the sense of double standards that angered many Pakistanis – one rule for white women, another for brown – was reinforced two months later, when a feminist rally of women riding bikes in Peshawar was <a href=""https://images.dawn.com/news/1181698"" title="""">banned by the authorities</a>. (Alex Reynolds, who has Filipino heritage, also noticed the gora complex on her travels. “The first time I went to Pakistan, I had a white boyfriend,” she told me. “Then, people were giving us rides, and food, and gifts and things. When I started travelling alone, that stopped.”)</p> <p>In January 2019, a particularly clueless would-be influencer emerged. An American woman named Samantha A Gerry, who described herself as a vlogger and model, tweeted: “Will be in #Pakistan – June 2019 – looking for recommendations/things to do from fellow vloggers/couch surfers! Inspired by @CynthiaDRitchie – following you into the unknown, girl!” Within a few hours, she had hundreds of replies and direct messages from prominent Pakistanis – the scions of a prominent Lahore political family, among others – offering to take her to parties during her trip.</p> <p>More tweets followed. Was there a Starbucks in Peshawar, Gerry wondered. Should she wear a burqa on her travels? She wrote about how beautiful Pakistan was, and threw in some anti-India sentiment for good measure. Her follower count shot up. When journalists pointed out that her profile picture was taken from a stock photography website, Gerry responded: “OH MY GOD! I Just joined Twitter and mention Pakistan and there are so many people spreading all kinds of rumours about me.” Many of her new followers leaped to her defence.</p> <p>A week later, the Karachi-based comedian, Shehzad Ghias Shaikh, <a href=""https://twitter.com/Shehzad89/status/1089508250184310784"" title="""">owned up</a> to the hoax. He had created “Samantha A Gerry” to satirise the travel-influencer trend, and in particular Ritchie, who was growing increasingly bullish on social media about the need to promote a “positive image” of Pakistan. “We’re hungry for good news, and when it comes from a white person, it adds more validity,” Shaikh told me. “But our inferiority complex and that neo-colonial mindset makes a dangerous combination.”</p> <p>In Karachi earlier this year, I met Amtul Baweja and Fahad Tariq, a young married couple who produce travel content on Instagram and YouTube under the name <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/patangeer/?hl=en"" title="""">Patangeer</a>, which means “wandering kite” in Urdu. Situated above a beauty salon in an upmarket part of town, their office has the look of a Shoreditch design agency, with stark metal lockers and a large wooden table.</p> <p>“We love [the foreign influencers] – they kind of put Pakistan on the map for us,” said Tariq. “But there’s no doubt they get privileges we don’t get.”</p> <p>“White privilege is very true,” Baweja agreed.</p> <p>The couple have been repeatedly harassed by police while filming videos, even at major tourist sites, such as Lahore’s Shalimar Gardens, or the beach in their home town of Karachi.</p> <p>“If we try and shoot, we get antagonised and treated like criminals, whereas they get gates opened and red carpets put down for them,” said Tariq.</p> <p>“Which is good that they’re being hospitable,” said Baweja. “But why not for your own locals, too?”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>By 2018, the year of Pakistan’s most recent general election, Ritchie had been based in Islamabad for the best part of a decade. She was enmeshed in the city’s small social scene, populated by a mix of foreigners and wealthy Pakistanis, and its party circuit – staid affairs at embassies, and more raucous events at the spacious homes of expats.</p> <p>As Ritchie’s public platform grew, so did questions on social media about what she was doing in Pakistan. Her <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCizkxWpQ-NKZ3hHHbQ1M3Kw"" title="""">YouTube channel</a> describes her as an “adventurist”, and as Zu Beck and Gabrielle became famous in Pakistan, she was often spoken about by journalists and on social media in the same breath. But the content Ritchie was making had changed, and now bore little resemblance to that of most adventure travellers. Rather than putting out videos gushing over mountain ranges and food markets, she was writing op-eds in Pakistani newspapers about <a href=""https://tribune.com.pk/story/1882213/understanding-5th-generation-warfare"" title="""">information warfare</a> and arguing with liberals on Twitter. Although she was often referred to as a blogger, she didn’t have a blog. Several academic researchers told me that since the mid-2010s, they had noticed Ritchie attending policing and security conferences around Pakistan. On her social media, she posted <a href=""https://twitter.com/CynthiaDRitchie/status/757006941109391360/photo/1"" title="""">occasional</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/CynthiaDRitchie/status/1051411893536088064/photo/2"" title="""">photos</a> of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10213414096839524&amp;set=pb.1012826475.-2207520000..&amp;type=3"" title="""">herself</a> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BhHl9fbnind/"" title="""">with</a> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/cynthiadritchie/photos/pcb.1787158988049253/1787158104716008/"" title="""">military</a> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/Bh2NJILn6Fz/"" title="""">officials</a> and at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/Bh3QvTsjrF-/"" title="""">police</a> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BFsNC66sP5J/"" title="""">training</a> facilities.</p> <p>Ritchie is vague when discussing her work; she told me that she finds the term influencer “tacky”, and that she works in “strategic communication”. What comes across from speaking to her is a sense of mission – that it is not only incumbent on her personally, but within her power, to change Pakistan’s internal culture and its standing in the world. “I want to reinforce the behaviours that we desire to see in society,” she said. At another point, she said: “My story is more of suffering than anything else, but I believe it to be a worthy cause.”</p> <p>As the July 2018 election approached, Ritchie became more vocal in her support for Imran Khan’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), and of the military. The election campaign, which brought Khan to power, was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/21/pakistan-imran-khan-elections-arrests-intimidation"" title="""">marred by censorship</a>. Politicians from other parties, including the incumbent PML-N, were arrested, most of them on corruption charges, which they denied. Three news channels were <a href=""https://rsf.org/en/news/three-pakistani-tv-news-channels-suddenly-taken-air"" title="""">taken off air</a> by the regulator after having broadcast speeches by major political parties opposed to the PTI. Meanwhile, PTI rallies were aired without problems. In her frequent tweets about politics, Ritchie confronted critics of the military, often using language that seemed to echo official rhetoric. As mass protests against military overreach – organised by a grassroots group, the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) – swept across Pakistan, Ritchie <a href=""https://twitter.com/CynthiaDRitchie/status/1062610032599154688?s=20"" title="""">insinuated</a> that the PTM were sympathetic to terrorists, an allegation that had also been made by military officials.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""55cdf0f19ffecfec7f3311aecc0e453635dbd224""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/55cdf0f19ffecfec7f3311aecc0e453635dbd224/0_0_1721_943/1000.jpg"" alt=""Eva zu Beck in a video she posted from Gwadar, Pakistan in 2019."" width=""1000"" height=""548"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Eva zu Beck in a video she posted from Gwadar, Pakistan in 2019.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Eva zu Beck</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few months after the election, when a journalist critical of the military accused Ritchie of “propaganda” and doing “consultancy” for the military’s press division, the ISPR, Ritchie <a href=""https://twitter.com/CynthiaDRitchie/status/1060239811850706944?s=20"" title="""">tweeted</a>: “Even if I did ‘consult’ for ISPR, so what?? It’s called ‘PR’ for a reason – they do PR, as do ALL world powers.” When some Twitter users asked who was funding the documentary project that she first trailed in 2015, Ritchie’s supporters responded angrily. “Who the hell r u? Someone is showing positive side of Pakistan to the world, does it matter who is paying?” read <a href=""https://twitter.com/IamAsim/status/1060426862600577024?s=20"" title="""">one</a> tweet.</p> <p>For people who knew Ritchie socially, there was a disconnect between her charming real-life presence and her often aggressive persona online, where she has accused her critics of acting like “<a href=""https://twitter.com/CynthiaDRitchie/status/1267321454409977856?s=20"" title="""">traitors</a>” and <a href=""https://twitter.com/CynthiaDRitchie/status/1235506291457626118?s=20"" title="""">told</a> Pakistani feminists to “Get the #FairAndLovely [skin-whitening cream] out of your eyes”. “I’d met her a few times at parties and thought she was nice enough, friendly – then when I looked her up on Twitter I was taken aback,” said a Pakistani acquaintance of Ritchie’s, who lives in Islamabad. “I was like – what is this? Is she on the military payroll or has she seriously drunk the Kool-Aid?”</p> <p>Part of the reason that people have speculated about Ritchie’s motivations is the fact that, despite being American, her lines of attack are those usually associated with the most conservative, ultra-nationalist Pakistanis. She has <a href=""https://twitter.com/CynthiaDRitchie/status/1184150917756702721?s=20"" title="""">criticised</a> human rights activists for not showing national pride, feminists for going <a href=""https://twitter.com/CynthiaDRitchie/status/1236223208963047425?s=20"" title="""">too far</a> in their demands, politicians for being <a href=""https://twitter.com/CynthiaDRitchie/status/1268074750519189504?s=20"" title="""">immodest</a>. When I pointed out to Ritchie that some of her views were surprising for an American in Pakistan, she hit back: “Not many Americans have travelled the country like I have.” She describes herself as “impartial”, “authentic”, and interested in “the facts on the ground”. “I’m not getting a brief from [the government] and tweeting it. I tweet whatever I want to,” she told me.</p> <p>The fanbase that has developed around Ritchie can be split into two camps. The first enjoys her travel content, and her sunny portrayals of Pakistan. For the second camp, who actively support the military and spend their time on social media attacking anyone they see as insufficiently patriotic, Ritchie is a useful ally, an outsider who reflects their worldview. “More power to you Cynthia. Keep exposing the filthy culprits who have eaten up this country like mites,” wrote one Twitter user.</p> <p>In 2019, questions about Ritchie’s links to the army intensified on social media when she posted <a href=""https://twitter.com/CynthiaDRitchie/status/1138916673984049159?s=20"" title="""">footage</a> of a <a href=""https://twitter.com/cynthiadritchie/status/1119902333452935168"" title="""">trip</a> to Pakistan’s heavily contested tribal areas. She told me that the trip had actually taken place in the run-up to the 2018 election, and that it had been part of an “interview process” at which military officials were “assessing and monitoring me, my experience, and determining my worth and capacity as an individual”, and that afterwards she was offered a big project. It is difficult to know what to make of comments like this, given that at other times Ritchie <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/Bk-fj1-j3Np/"" title="""">flat-out denies</a> working for the military.</p> <p>Having offered this puzzling explanation, Ritchie then dismissed the entire controversy over the pictures as just another fuss about nothing. “Look, if I had anything to hide, I wouldn’t be publishing these things,” she said. She pointed out that anyone who wants to travel to the tribal areas needs army permission: “You can’t access some of these areas without the military.”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>When Imran Khan was elected, he took over a country in the midst of an economic crisis, and his ministers saw tourism as an opportunity for recovery. Until the pandemic stalled progress, Pakistan’s tourism push seemed to be gaining momentum. “We spent the last decade fighting a war against terrorism,” Akbar Durrani, the federal information secretary, told me in March. “Now we’ve gone from terrorism to tourism, and we are proud of it.”</p> <p>One of the key players in this project is Zulfi Bukhari, head of the national tourism board and a close friend of Imran Khan’s. He is a young man with a sharp haircut whose own <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sayedz.bukhari/"" title="""">Instagram page</a> makes him look a bit like an influencer. In March 2020, before the country went into lockdown, I sat in on a meeting between Bukhari and executives from Facebook as they discussed collaborating on a nation-branding project for Pakistan. In his pitch, Bukhari stated with confidence: “This is going to be the coolest thing Pakistan has ever done.”</p> <p>When we spoke after the meeting, Bukhari talked excitedly about plans to boost tourism. He was impatient when I asked about western influencers. “I think it’s a silly debate really, it’s irrelevant,” he said. “International bloggers appeal to the international crowd.” Yet despite Bukhari’s claims, there is little dispute that much of the content produced about Pakistan is being consumed by Pakistanis, not the foreign tourists that the state is desperate to attract. “It’s an inverted model of image-building – to convince the people inside the country that Pakistan is good,” argues Ayesha Siddiqa, academic and author of Military Inc: Inside Pakistan’s Military Economy<em>.</em></p> <p>One region where western influencers have been granted extraordinary access is Balochistan, one of the hardest areas of Pakistan to visit. Since Pakistan’s formation in 1947, this south-western province has been home to a separatist insurgency, which has been harshly repressed. Since the most recent uprising in 2007, thousands of people alleged to have links to the separatist movement have disappeared, and more than 1,000 political activists have <a href=""https://unpo.org/article/21644"" title="""">been killed</a>. But in 2019, the influencer Rosie Gabrielle was allowed to undertake a solo motorcycle tour of the province, and Eva zu Beck has also posted videos from there.

Either way, he sees no problem with this approach. “If somebody is trying to portray Pakistan in a bad way, the information ministry will try to stop them by refusing to grant the NOC [travel permit]. But if you’re doing a good thing, people will help you,” he told me. “It’s a very easy formula.”</p> <p>Among the places Zu Beck has visited in Balochistan is Gwadar, a remote, heavily militarised city where China <a href=""https://www.csis.org/analysis/pakistans-gwadar-port-new-naval-base-chinas-string-pearls-indo-pacific"" title="""">is constructing</a> a deep-water port. Both the Pakistani state and private companies have touted Gwadar as “the new Dubai”, and in 2018, one company that sells properties in the city began organising visits for influencers. In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ixHpWi2tHo"" title="""">one video</a> from her tour, Zu Beck is on a deserted beach with waves lashing the shore. “It’s the most beautiful place,” she says, laughing with delight. “There’s no one here, no one for miles. I just … How can nobody know about this place?” In April 2019, a few months after Zu Beck posted her video, 14 people travelling to Gwadar from Karachi were <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/world/asia/pakistan-bus-killings.html"">shot dead</a> after gunmen stormed their bus was attacked. The following month, <a href=""https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/12/asia/gwadar-hotel-attack-intl/index.html"">gunmen stormed</a> the five-star hotel where Zu Beck and other members of her delegation had stayed on their visit, murdering five people.</p> <p>“Expecting all travel bloggers to cover subjects related to politics or national security is a tricky demand,” Zu Beck told me via email, when I asked about the disparity between her videos and the reality on the ground. She pointed out that someone visiting a country for a short time may not have the experience and knowledge to address complex political matters. Although people offering practical guides to travellers had an obligation to address security questions, she said, that wasn’t the kind of content she was making. “People have this idea that I make vlogs in order to promote tourism destinations,” she had told me when we first spoke. “That idea is wrong. My videos are not travel guides, and they are not practical pieces of advice. They are stories. That’s all they are.”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>There is nothing remarkable about nations encouraging social media influencers to promote tourism. But in Pakistan, as one valve has opened, another has been closed. Human rights activists and journalists are experiencing unprecedented levels of state harassment. In the run-up to the 2018 election, the journalist Gul Bukhari was on the way to a TV studio one night when her car was intercepted by intelligence officers and she was blindfolded and bundled into another vehicle. She was then driven to a safe house and interrogated for hours. “As well as many other things, they said to me: ‘Why are you working against Pakistan? Take our narrative,’” she told me.</p> <p>Eventually, Bukhari was <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44382719"" title="""">released</a>, and soon afterwards – like many others who speak out against the military establishment – she left the country. But leaving Pakistan does not always guarantee safety. Earlier this year, the Pakistani journalist Sajjid Hussain, editor of the Balochistan Times, disappeared from his home in Sweden, and was later <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/family-of-pakistani-journalist-await-truth-of-his-death-in-sweden"" title="""">found dead</a> in a river. Reporters Without Borders has <a href=""https://rsf.org/en/news/concern-about-pakistani-dissident-journalists-disappearance-sweden"" title="""">urged</a> investigators to look into the theory that Pakistani intelligence may be connected to Hussain’s death. In July, a leaked internal government <a href=""https://rsf.org/en/news/rsf-warns-pakistani-authorities-not-threaten-journalists-living-abroad"" title="""">memo</a> revealed that officials had been ordered to “strictly follow the movements and social media accounts” of six Pakistani journalists based abroad, and to tell them to stop their “rhetoric against Pakistan”.</p> <p>The idea that people are either “for” or “against” Pakistan is a crude binary, but it is one that military spokesmen often use, and it underpins the country’s communication strategy. As a member of the Pakistani diaspora, officials regularly tell me that, being “a daughter of Pakistan”, my journalism should be more positive. It is also a binary that Ritchie often promotes, using hashtags such as #PositivePakistan and tweeting about the need to “show the positive face” of the country.</p> <p>When we spoke a second time, meeting in a cafe in Islamabad on a rainy spring day this year, I asked Ritchie about allegations that she was working with military authorities. “People assume I work for ISPR [the military’s press division]. I don’t fucking work for ISPR. I freelance, I take on things on a project-to-project basis,” she said. She claimed that this allegation came from “a group of individuals who are anti-Pakistan”, including Husain Haqqani, the former Pakistani ambassador to the US.</p> <p>When I spoke to Haqqani, a critic of the military who now lives in self-imposed exile in the US, he sounded irritated: “She would hurl abuse at me for being a traitor to Pakistan, but who is she to be the arbiter? The notion that she loves Pakistan more than Pakistanis who dissent from its policies is preposterous.”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>By 2020, most of the travel influencers making content about Pakistan had moved on. After leaving Pakistan last year, Zu Beck has made travel content around the world, including a trip to Syria. She sat out the pandemic lockdown on Socotra, an island off the coast of Yemen.</p> <p>But Ritchie stayed put. In February 2020, she posted another documentary <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/cynthiadritchie/videos/624663468095990"" title="""">trailer</a> on Facebook, for a series made with the provincial government of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan’s north-western province. In person, Ritchie has a friendly manner, and speaks authoritatively even when she is being vague. When I asked where the series would be airing, we went back and forth for about 10 minutes (“I’ve been approached by a significant network”; “I wanted it to be genuine, me as a citizen creating content”) before eventually establishing it was going to be a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDVwBDjsvKA&amp;feature=youtu.be"" title="""">web series</a>.</p> <p>Around the time the new trailer was released, Ritchie’s tweets were becoming increasingly inflammatory. For the last couple of years, Pakistani feminists have held an event on International Women’s Day called the Aurat March (“aurat” means “woman” in Urdu). As the date, 8 March, approached, Ritchie attacked the organisers, who she said were privileged and did not represent normal women in Pakistan. Replying to the inevitable backlash, she <a href=""https://twitter.com/cynthiadritchie/status/1235829594134958081?lang=en"" title="""">tweeted</a>: “In my years in Pakistan (since 2009) the ONE group who’s tried to bully/insult me the most for my opinions/experiences -isn’t the Taliban/Tribals. It’s the Female Desi ‘Liberal’ – same ppl supporting <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/AuratMarch?src=hashtag_click"" title="""">#AuratMarch</a>. The TALIBAN were more tolerant of difference of opinion than this lot.”</p> <p>I met Ritchie the week after the march, and when I asked about this, she launched into a long explanation about the importance of dialogue with the Taliban. (“I’m not a Taliban sympathiser, I’m looking for fact”; “When we discuss a liberal, what’s your definition of a liberal?”) She was dismissive of the charge that she was setting herself up as a white saviour. “Is there an argument other than ‘colonialist mindset’? I’m one person, give me a break.”</p> <p>In the weeks that followed, Ritchie increasingly turned her ire on the PPP, one of the main opposition parties to Khan’s ruling PTI. She shared a series of <a href=""https://twitter.com/CynthiaDRitchie/status/1268074750519189504?s=20"" title="""">photos</a> showing PPP politicians in supposedly compromising positions – one posing with a skimpily clad waxwork in a museum (“They’re very pious people,” she tweeted, sarcastically.) Then, in late May, she made an <a href=""https://twitter.com/CynthiaDRitchie/status/1265819204755873792"" title="""">extraordinary allegation</a> about Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister and PPP politician who was assassinated in 2007: “when her husband cheated, [she’d] have the guards rape the women. Why do women condone this rape culture? Why aren’t the men ever held accountable? Where is the justice system?”</p> <p>Bhutto is a national heroine, and for many, these unsubstantiated comments were the final straw. Several PPP activists attempted to launch libel claims against Ritchie, although none of these attempts were successful. Soon afterwards, she made a further series of explosive claims. On 5 June, she <a href=""https://twitter.com/CynthiaDRitchie/status/1268883571210682368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"" title="""">tweeted</a> that members of the PPP were threatening her because “they know that over the years I have been raped/assaulted by men in the highest ranks of PPP. They don’t want the world to know.” She elaborated on her accusations in a Facebook Live video: “In 2011, I was raped by the former interior minister Rehman Malik,” she said. She went on to make separate accusations that the former federal minister Makhdoom Shahabuddin and ex-prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani “physically manhandl[ed]” her.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""7759ee38d288092edf507a326d861a6798b20ea8""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/7759ee38d288092edf507a326d861a6798b20ea8/0_0_1435_861/1000.jpg"" alt=""Cynthia Ritchie talking to press outside court in Islamabad in September."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Cynthia Ritchie talking to press outside court in Islamabad in September.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: 24 News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the days after Ritchie made her allegations, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_gqFZevNdQ&amp;t=303s"" title="""">she appeared</a> on major news networks, going into a level of detail about her allegations that was extremely unusual in a conservative country where any discussion of sex is taboo. Pakistan is a patriarchal society where women are routinely blamed if they are assaulted. Earlier this autumn, there were national protests when a woman was gang-raped after her car broke down and the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/11/backlash-in-pakistan-as-police-appear-to-blame-woman-motorist-for-gang"" title="""">police chief</a> said publicly that she shouldn’t have been travelling alone at night. Across the country, a vanishingly small number of sexual assaults are reported, and of those, <a href=""https://www.geo.tv/latest/308019-less-than-3-rapes-in-pakistan-lead-to-conviction#:~:text=In%20Pakistan%2C%20the%20conviction%20rate,War%20Against%20Rape%20(WAR)."" title="""">fewer than 3%</a> result in conviction. But as Ritchie’s story made national and then international headlines, the different strands were often conflated: on the one hand, the actual substance of the rape and assault allegations and the endemic culture of sexual harassment in Pakistan, and on the other, Ritchie’s own political affiliations and her place in the country.</p> <p>On Twitter, many of Ritchie’s followers expressed support, and the hashtag #CynthiaIsPrideOfPakistan trended in the country. While some feminists called for an impartial investigation, others remained conspicuously silent, and some implied that these allegations were politically motivated. Even some of Ritchie’s fans were ambivalent. “When I first encountered Cynthia, I admired her advocacy work to portray Pakistan positively. It was a relief – I thought: ‘This is the image of my country I want to see,’” said one US-based Pakistani, who saw Ritchie giving a talk to an audience of diaspora Pakistanis in the US a few years ago. “But more recently I have questions about her allegations and the other claims she’s made.”</p> <p>Ritchie denies that her allegations are politically motivated. “My story came out because loved ones all over the world were being harassed by people linked to PPP,” she told me via email recently. “So, no, my accusations were not politically motivated but rather – I’d had enough.” Ritchie said that, after the story broke, “The people, including many in PPP, have been mostly supportive”, but that she also received “hundreds of sexually explicit rape threats, calls, messages from PPP workers”.</p> <p>All the men accused denied the allegations, and the police have <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1572859/cynthias-plea-against-rehman-malik-dismissed%20Read%20more%20at:%20https://southasiamonitor.org/pakistan/cynthia-ritchies-plea-against-former-minister-rehman-malik-dismissed:"" title="""">refused to open a criminal investigation</a>, claiming that Ritchie has not produced any evidence to support her allegations of rape and harassment. Ritchie is currently appealing this decision in the Islamabad high court.</p> <p>As Ritchie pursued her allegations and spoke to the media, investigative journalists in Pakistan began to scrutinise her closely, digging out visas and other documents to try and establish what she was doing there. One such document was a letter that Ritchie wrote in the summer to the Federal Investigation Agency while it was considering whether there was a libel case against her. In it, she said she had been “an active force in promoting Positive Pakistan” and had “worked closely with Counter Terrorism Department (CTD)”, as well as with the police and military. But what drew the most attention was Ritchie’s claim that she had been “investigating” the PTM protest movement “for the last two years (with the assistance of supporting agencies and military)” and that “in this process our teams have found links of anti-state activities between PTM and PPP”. This raised more questions than it answered: What teams? What anti-state activities? And given that Ritchie is not a journalist, in what capacity was she investigating?</p> <p>“There’s a tendency in Pakistan towards conspiracy theory anyway, and given the stuff she says, it’s hardly a leap to think, ‘Oh, the military is behind it all’”, said the acquaintance of Ritchie’s who lives in Islamabad. “It’s easy enough to believe that she was doing film projects for ISPR, but what on earth would it mean for her to investigate PTM? Part of me wonders, is there an element of delusion here, or self-aggrandisement? Or is she just out of her depth?”</p> <p>When I contacted Ritchie recently about this letter, she insisted that it had been misunderstood. “When I wrote ‘worked with’ it was merely a collaborative effort in terms of travel,” she told me via email. “I was never an employee or consultant – paid or otherwise.” She said that the investigation she referred to was for an independent film that she is making: “I needed clearances to access some of the tribal areas.”</p> <p>Over the past few months, Ritchie has continued to fight vociferously with her critics on Twitter – calling on her adversaries to <a href=""https://twitter.com/CynthiaDRitchie/status/1293581801890418690?s=20"" title="""">support</a> her despite their political differences, and <a href=""https://twitter.com/CynthiaDRitchie/status/1318096157122375680?s=20"" title="""">equating herself</a> with “the abused woman &amp; children of Pakistan” – even as she comes under increasing legal pressure. The court case, in which she is arguing that her allegations merit a full police investigation, has been beset by delays. And in September, the Islamabad high court refused to extend Ritchie’s visa, giving her <a href=""https://tribune.com.pk/story/2262174/cynthia-ritchie-given-15-days-to-leave-pakistan"" title="""">15 days to leave</a> the country. Pakistan’s visa system is capricious, and refusals or long <a href=""https://tribune.com.pk/story/2262895/ihc-temporarily-stays-cynthia-ritchies-deportation"" title="""">delays</a> are common, but given that Ritchie had remained in the country for more than a decade, the decision seemed to demonstrate a shift in her political fortune. “She serves [ISPR’s] purpose,” said Haqqani, the former ambassador. “That said, they probably realise that now the controversies outweigh any benefits.”</p> <p>After the high court’s announcement in September, Ritchie <a href=""https://twitter.com/CynthiaDRitchie/status/1301131340742619136"" title="""">tweeted</a>: “Whether I am in Pakistan or USA I will continue fighting the hypocrisy of Liberals &amp; self proclaimed Human Rights activists of Pakistan. Borders cannot stop me Loving Pakistan &amp; its people who gave me respect and love. I won’t stop fighting for the right cause. Pakistan Zindabad!” (“Long live Pakistan”.) Ritchie’s lawyer told the court that she could not be guaranteed a fair trial in her court case if she was not in the country. The court said that she could stay – for now. But her future hangs in the balance.</p> <p>“There’s so much more to Pakistan than this devastating maelstrom of bullshit,” Ritchie said to me back in March, reflecting on all the controversies that surrounded her even then. “My hope is to tell the story of the rural areas, the common man and their rich history, so that when I transition to my next phase in life, I can walk away and say: ‘I did this for you.’” </p> <p>• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=""https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread"" title="""">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email"" title="""">here</a>.",False,pillar/news,News,['gang-rape']

They’re cuffed, how can they really hurt you?” he said.</p> <p>Video shows Floyd was already handcuffed by the time he was forced onto the ground.</p> <p>“I saw no reason why the officers felt they were in danger, if that’s what they felt. And that is what they have to feel to use that level of force,” said Zimmerman.</p> <p>Chauvin, 45, has denied charges of second- and third-degree murder, and manslaughter, over Floyd’s death. He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge. Three other officers face separate charges.</p> <p>Zimmerman was one of 14 police officers who published a public letter to the citizens of Minneapolis a month after Floyd’s death, to “wholeheartedly condemn” Chauvin’s actions.</p> <p>“Like us, Derek Chauvin took an oath to hold the sanctity of life most precious,” they <a href=""https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-officers-letter-rallies-add-to-voices-for-change/571189142/?refresh=true"">wrote</a>. “Derek Chauvin failed as a human and stripped George Floyd of his dignity and life. This is not who we are.”</p> <p>Zimmerman told the trial officers are trained in the dangers of keeping a detained person in the prone position on the ground. Floyd was held for more than nine minutes with Chauvin’s knee on his neck and two other officers pinning his torso and legs.</p> <p>“Once you secure or handcuff a person, you need to get them out of the prone position as soon as possible because it restricts their breathing,” Zimmerman said.</p> <p>Chauvin’s lawyer, Eric Nelson, put it to Zimmerman “that in a fight for your life, you as an officer are allowed to use whatever force is necessary?”</p> <p>Nelson challenged the detective’s claim never to have been trained to put a knee to a suspect’s neck, but Zimmerman said the training was to place the knee on a person’s shoulder and only while handcuffing them.</p> <p>Zimmerman also told the court that police failed to follow critical incident procedures intended to ensure officers are properly interrogated. Zimmerman said that procedure meant the officers involved in Floyd’s death should have been taken in separate squad cars to an interview room for questioning. Yet he found two of the officers, Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane, still at the scene.

Describing the first alleged attack, she said: “He grabbed my upper arms, shaking me, throwing me against walls, on to the floor and against furniture. I was just flying, like I was a rag doll, like I was worth nothing.</p> <p>“There would be times I would be running trying to get away from him, into different rooms, and he would just be swearing at me and threatening me, calling me a fucking bitch, and I was just cowering,” she said.</p> <p>“One time he threatened me with an empty wine bottle to my face, shouting: ‘You fucking bitch, I’ll kill you.’ I thought I was going to die that night,” she said. “Because of his behaviour I have felt intimidated and silenced for many years.”</p> <p>Edwards denied attacking Evans, saying her “specific claims are false” but added: “There are incidents in my past which I am ashamed of, and which I have worked hard to put behind me.”</p> <p>He said he had been arrested for assaulting a partner in 2012, while she was pregnant, and after pleading guilty to causing actual bodily harm was sentenced to 15 weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p>Evans said she decided to go public about the alleged abuse that she said happened during her relationship with the rapper 13 years ago after hearing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/23/aoc-speech-video-ted-yoho"">calling out </a>a sexist culture of “accepting violence and violent language against women”.</p> <p>“I felt like I’d been complicit, enabling and in alliance with this man,” she said.</p> <p>Edwards has been a fixture on the UK hip-hop scene for more than three decades. He hosted a show on BBC Radio 1Xtra for more than six years, and has presented a number of music documentaries for BBC4.</p> <p>In his statement, he admitted to hitting a former girlfriend 24 years ago, describing it as an “isolated incident” that “immediately ended the relationship” and of which he was ‘deeply ashamed’.</p> <p>But the former girlfriend referred to in the statement told the Guardian the attack happened after they had split up and after Edwards had discovered she had started a new relationship.</p> <p>Describing the attack, she said that after “reading something he didn’t like” in her diary he struck her with the back of his hand across her face, splitting her lip.</p> <p>He locked himself in the bathroom with her diary, then opened the door and dragged her in, she said. “He dragged me in by my throat and pinned me up against the wall until my feet came off the ground,” she said.</p> <p>“He kept asking me the most intimate of questions you could possibly imagine. And it wasn’t about what I answered, it was about what he wanted to hear, what he had convinced himself of. I thought that day I was going to die.”</p> <p>The woman said it was the only incidence of physical violence, but that for the following year the rapper had “constantly called and bullied” her, checking where she was going and verbally abusing her, leaving her in a “state of anxiety and nervousness”, she said:</p> <p>“He would call me and question who I’d been speaking to, where I had been.”</p> <p>Edwards said: “I could not comment on the impact my actions may have had on [her] mental health. The incident referred to ended our 10-year relationship [...] I am still deeply sorry that I ever hurt [her].”</p> <p>He added: “I do not in any way condone domestic violence and would do anything in my power to right my wrongs. Unfortunately, I can’t. To every person that has been affected by this I am truly sorry.”</p> <p>Edwards’ label Tru Thoughts records issued a statement last week, saying their work with Edwards was “currently suspended”, and adding: ”We take domestic abuse very seriously, and we do not condone abusive behaviour in any way.”</p> <p>The woman said she had been left uncomfortable seeing Edwards present BBC documentaries. “The fact that he’s abused and bullied me and other women yet managed to garner success as this ‘godfather of UK hip-hop’ is deceptive, when he’s left so much damage in his wake,” she said.</p> <p>“As a survivor of abuse, you are deeply affected for the rest of your life.”</p> <p>The Guardian has seen a complaint sent to the BBC that accused Edwards of domestic abuse after he presented Rodney P’s Jazz Funk at the end of July. A response dated 10 September, stated the corporation was “not aware of any reports of the nature mentioned” and concerns should be taken to the “appropriate authorities”.</p> <p>It added: “His experience in the music industry is the reason he was involved in our programming – personal matters aren’t connected to the documentary subject.”</p> <p>“It is like they are saying domestic abuse has nothing to do with us,” said Evans. In a statement, the BBC said: “Details of these serious incidents were not disclosed prior to us working with him. There are currently no plans to work with him in the future.”</p> <p>Evans said she hoped society could talk more openly and without shame about domestic abuse. “We all mess up,” she said. “But we have to take responsibility for our mistakes otherwise we leave a legacy of pain and trauma.”",False,pillar/news,News,"['women killed over honor', 'child abuse', 'domestic violence', 'sexual abuse']"

That warning was repeated two days later, prompting the ABC to organise a flight out on Thursday.</p> \n<p>But, according to the ABC, before he could leave, police officers arrived at Birtles’ apartment at midnight on Wednesday, as he was hosting farewell drinks. He was reportedly told he had been banned from leaving the country and would be interviewed over “a national security case”.</p> \n<p>Birtles said he had initially been cynical of government advice to leave China, fearing departure would be seen by Beijing as a political move and would thus make it difficult for Australian media to return.</p> \n<p>“But by midnight on Wednesday, the knock at the door came and there were six state security police and a translator, and so, clearly at the time I thought: well the Department of Foreign Affairs’ advice wasn’t bad, they had a hunch something was going on.

Many of us are feeling completely overwhelmed by having to educate our children remotely again, nearly 11 months into the pandemic, often while juggling our own work commitments.</p> <p>As a parent, it’s only natural to worry about the impact of such disruption on a child’s educational progress and wellbeing. With children of all ages currently out of school with no definitive return date, it is difficult to know what they “should” be achieving on a day-to-day basis and how you can help them get the most out of this unpredictable time. So we spoke to Emma Marshall – a senior school headteacher, and clinical child psychologist Dr Kate Mason, to find out the real impact of this continuing situation on children and their top five tips on how we can really help them.</p> <h2>Emma Marshall</h2> <p>Emma Marshall is headteacher at Havelock academy in Grimsby. Her main focus during the current lockdown is to ensure that parents and students have easy access to all of the tools needed to continue learning online, in a way that supports their needs as a family. She says that although she is a teacher, she also faces real challenges as a mum in overseeing the remote learning of her 12-year-old daughter and 17-year-old son. She recommends:</p> <p><strong>1 Make it suit your family situation</strong><br>Everyone’s home situation and setup is different and as a headteacher my priority is to make sure that our parents and students feel supported, and know how to easily access the learning resources provided. Along with live lessons, we’re also putting together paper packs of work for those who would really struggle accessing everything online as we understand that not everyone has the technology, or perhaps it’s just not suitable for their learning style or their family situation. The main thing to remember is that we are here for you, so if something just isn’t working for you or your child with regards to the lessons being provided, tell us so that we can help. Don’t feel you’re alone in this because I guarantee nearly every parent and teacher will be feeling the same in some regards.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""47ba71c28891be48b1bcf97306300564c4fbe469""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/47ba71c28891be48b1bcf97306300564c4fbe469/192_30_1246_1246/1000.jpg"" alt=""Havelock academy headteacher Emma Marshall."" width=""1000"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Havelock academy headteacher Emma Marshall.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: John Aron</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>2 Prioritise some sort of routine</strong><br>If nothing else, I would absolutely encourage parents to make sure their kids get up, get showered and dressed and not spend the day in their pyjamas. That way, when they sit down to do some work, it’s mentally like they’re approaching an actual school day. (However, I think putting school uniforms on might be a step too far!) In the first few days of this lockdown I’d return home from work to find our 12-year-old daughter with her laptop, under a duvet and still in her pyjamas. So I said no. Now she knows she must brush her teeth, get washed and dressed and eat something nutritious at a sensible lunchtime – as she would do normally. Because they <em>will </em>have to come back to school at some point. Straying too far from a normal routine and good habits will just make the return to normality even harder.</p> <p><strong>3 Check in with your child<br></strong>Talk to your children – ask them how they’re doing and, most importantly, how they’re feeling. Ask them to tell you five things they’ve learned that day. And remember to reward them. It doesn’t have to be with physical rewards, it can just be a “well done” when you can see that they’ve attempted to do something. Praise goes a long way, especially at the moment. Make sure your child knows that they can get in touch with their school with any problems at all – however big or small it seems to them, their teacher will want to know if they’re struggling in any way whatsoever. Encourage daily exercise away from the screen. They may have some amazing online provision but they don’t want to be in front of their screens all day. Getting out and having a walk is really important. Reading a book, engaging with pets and speaking to their friends is all to be encouraged, as much as the home learning.</p> <p><strong>4 You don’t have to do everything</strong><br>Don’t try to do everything that the school is setting. I promise that nobody is going to tell you that you’re doing a terrible job. I think it’s important that we think back to our school days and remember the pressure we all felt without the pandemic, so don’t make them try to achieve everything they’ve been set in school, from home. If you could do that, you wouldn’t need school in the first place. Don’t get hung up on it not looking like a normal school day – there’s no way it can do at the moment. As parents, we’re not teachers and experts. Even looking at my daughter’s year 8 maths makes my head spin! My role is to make sure she has somewhere safe and warm to work, that she has some vague routine, and then to say “well done” at the end of each day.</p> <p><strong>5 Encourage your children to look to the future</strong><br>I understand why parents, and students, are concerned about the future after all of this, especially those facing exams. My son is due to be off to university hopefully in September. Thankfully he’d worked hard up until this point but now he is a bit like: “Well, I might not even be doing my exams now so is there any point?” We need to keep reminding our children – and ourselves – that the future isn’t cancelled. This <em>will </em>end and things will go back to normal. Encourage them to keep looking forward and thinking about what is happening next. What subjects do they want to take? What are their plans for sixth form? What do they want to do at university? The future isn’t all out of the window, it’s very much just round the corner.</p> <h2>Dr Kate Mason</h2> <p>Dr Kate Mason is a clinical psychologist specialising in children and young people at <a href=""https://www.rootspsychologygroup.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">rootspsychologygroup.co.uk</a>. She understands through her job – and also firsthand as a mother – the impact that the continuing pandemic is having on the wellbeing of our children, and also the stress that it is causing parents. She recommends:</p> <p><strong>1 Your relationship with your child is your number one priority</strong><br>Last March, when we went into the first lockdown, my six-year-old just refused to do the home learning, so this time around I decided not to jeopardise my relationship with my son just to get him to do a bit of maths. I really do believe that in the grand scheme of their lifetime’s education, the younger ones especially will bounce back from this relatively short period of instability. Once I started thinking about it like that, I thought it is not worth the constant fallout. I emailed his teacher and said that I would get him to do what I could, but that a good, happy relationship with him is my first priority.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""fdeefd9a382dfa8d7037dd10f22a7ce92241faa1""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/fdeefd9a382dfa8d7037dd10f22a7ce92241faa1/0_103_1043_1042/1000.jpg"" alt=""Clinical psychologist Dr Kate Mason"" width=""1000"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Clinical psychologist Dr Kate Mason</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>2 Your frustration is coming from a good place</strong><br>During that time when I was losing it over my inability to make my son do his maths and handwriting, I took a step back and asked myself: “Why am I so angry?” And I realised that I was angry because I was scared. I was scared for his education and that it was going to have a massive impact on his life. Understand that is where your upset and frustration is likely to be coming from – ultimately a good place, a place of love for your child.</p> <p><strong>3 Keep calm … and make a visual timetable</strong><br>When children are calm, they are more able to learn. And kids feel calm, safe and contained – and then thrive – when there’s predictability and when they know what is coming next. Make a visual timetable with them peppered with lots of down time and fun stuff and most importantly something to look forward to at the end of the day. It’s vital to keep them looking forward. Treat yourself with calmness and self-compassion too. Remember, you are not their teacher. You can lead a horse to water, you can’t always make it drink. Nearly all children will listen to people who aren’t their immediate family, but they are designed to push your buttons. If this happens stop and take a break. Go and play a game, get their brains to calm down a bit – and only then come back and try again.</p> <p><strong>4 Ask them for their opinion<br></strong>Ask your children for their advice: “What do you think I should do in this situation?” The ability to think flexibly isn’t fully mature until a person is 24, so for any child under that age this is a brilliant chance for that part of their brain to mature and for them to learn real life skills. Educating your kids about emotional literacy is, in my opinion, just as important as developing their ability to do things like maths. Some [children’s films] are full of opportunities for you to ask them questions. Pop one on and engage with them by asking: “Why do you think that person feels that way?”; “How would you feel if that was one of your friends?”; “What could you do to help them?” Opportunities to think and talk emotionally will help develop resilience, confidence, compassion and empathy.</p> <p><strong>5 Congratulate them – and yourself</strong><br>Telling your children “well done” and reaffirming that you’re proud of them on the daily is so important. But you must congratulate yourself, too. You’re doing your best, you’re doing what you can. I think it’s just as important for parents to remember to look after themselves as well. When you’ve got through a hard day and you’ve only managed to get your kid to read two pages of a book, parents need to congratulate themselves. Don’t feel guilty about taking time out to go and have a bath or a walk, and you should also have something to look forward to at the end of the day, like a series on Netflix [or] a glass of wine. I’m a big advocate of parent sanity.

Critics of the departure deal’s Northern Ireland protocol say a border is in effect in the Irish Sea, leaving unionists feeling betrayed.</p> \n<p>“We have repeatedly urged HM Government, political leaders and Institutions to take seriously our warnings of the dangerous consequences of imposing this hard border on us and the need for earnest dialogue to resolve matters. We reiterate that message now,” the LCC said.</p> \n<p>In a detailed update on the tumultuous week, Northern Ireland’s assistant chief constable, Jonathan Roberts, revealed that a further 19 officers and one of the service’s dogs had been hurt during disturbances on Thursday, the seventh night of unrest.</p> \n<p>Police used water cannon for the first time in six years after dozens of young people on the nationalist side of the peace line ignored a warning to disperse and continued to throw stones, bottles and fireworks.</p> \n<figure class=""element element-atom""> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=""4f1d519a-ca9d-4981-a7e1-f0f83a141793"" data-atom-type=""media""> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xqSX7Zja5k4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0""></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On Friday night, PSNI officers at Tiger Bay, a loyalist area in north Belfast came under attack, with missiles such as stones and bottles thrown at them. A car was set on fire and there were reports of petrol bombs being used. There were also reports that stones were also thrown at police in the nearby, nationalist area New Lodge.</p> \n<p>PSNI Ch Supt Muir Clarke said: “We would appeal for calm in the area and ask anyone who has any influence in communities, please use that influence to ensure young people do not get caught up in criminality and that they are kept safe and away from harm tonight.”</p> \n<p>There were sporadic incidents of unrest elsewhere in Northern Ireland on Friday evening, with reports of a road blocked off with a barricade which was then set alight in Coleraine, Co Derry.</p> \n<p>The police’s assessment that paramilitaries were not involved marks a shift in opinion from earlier in the week when there were suspicions that loyalist extremists could be operating behind the scenes. On Thursday, Roberts said it was “clear there was a degree of organisation” to the violence.</p> \n<p>However, the PSNI appeared to backtrack on that position when asked on Friday about the LCC statement. “It’s our overall assessment that the violence that has taken place over the last few nights is not orchestrated by a group, in the name of that group,” it said.</p> \n<p>“We feel that there may be some people who could have connection to proscribed organisations, who have been present on the scenes of violence.

Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, called on Dick to resign. “This was a complete, abject, tactical and moral failure on the part of the police,” he said in a letter to the commissioner. “We therefore call on you to consider your leadership of the service.”</p> \n<p>Patel said that some of the footage circulating online from the vigil was “upsetting”, adding she had asked the Met for “a full report on what happened”. Khan said he was “urgently seeking an explanation”.</p> \n<p>In the early hours of Sunday, the Met’s Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball said police were put into a position “<a href=""https://news.met.police.uk/news/statement-from-ac-helen-ball-following-events-in-clapham-common-423210"">where enforcement action was necessary</a>”, because of “the overriding need to protect people’s safety.”</p> \n<p>“Hundreds of people were packed tightly together, posing a very real risk of easily transmitting Covid-19,” she said.</p> \n<p>“Police must act for people’s safety, this is the only responsible thing to do. The pandemic is not over and gatherings of people from right across London and beyond, are still not safe.”</p> \n<p>Ball said those who gathered were spoken to by officers on a number of occasions and over an extended period of time.</p> \n<p>Four people were arrested for public order offences and for breaches of the health protection regulations.</p> \n<p>The Met was accused of turning down opportunities to plan a socially distanced vigil with organisers ahead of the weekend. Organisers of Reclaim These Streets cancelled the event on Friday after failed attempts to work with police to make sure the vigil could go ahead safely.</p> \n<figure class=""element element-atom""> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=""aacb3621-c285-4279-a87f-79a5e9c7dcc0"" data-atom-type=""media""> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_Aj2SaiSCXE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0""></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Caroline Nokes, the Tory chair of the women and equalities committee, said she was “truly shocked at the scenes from Clapham Common – in this country we police by consent, not by trampling the tributes and dragging women to the ground”.</p> \n<p>The Labour leader Keir Starmer tweeted: “The scenes in Clapham this evening are deeply disturbing. Women came together to mourn Sarah Everard – they should have been able to do so peacefully.</p> \n<p>“I share their anger and upset at how this has been handled. This was not the way to police this protest.”</p> \n<p>Gracie Bradley, interim director of human rights group Liberty, said: “Police were given the choice on how to approach this protest. They could have worked with organisers to ensure people could collectively grieve and protest a lack of protection.</p> \n<p>“But instead they chose aggressive interventions that put people’s health at risk and led to chaos and distress.</p> \n<p>“The true architect of this disaster is the home secretary, who has relentlessly demonised protesters and refused to support a protest exemption to the lockdown rules.”</p> \n<p>Hundreds of people defied the police advice not to attend the memorial on Clapham Common, while in-person events also went ahead in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk/birmingham"">Birmingham</a> and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk/glasgow"">Glasgow</a>, where people gathered in George Square in the city centre. Women came alone or with small groups of friends to lay flowers, tie ribbons to the wooden benches beneath the statues and leave messages of solidarity.</p> \n<p>Earlier, the Duchess of Cambridge made an unexpected appearance to pay her respects at the memorial of flowers laid at the bandstand on Clapham Common.</p> \n<p>The government has been deluged with thousands of personal stories of harassment from women and girls across the country as demands grow for greater legal protection in the wake of the alleged kidnap and murder of Everard.</p> \n<p>An official call for people to share their experiences and opinions of crimes aimed at women has received an extraordinary 20,000 submissions since Friday night.</p> \n<p>The Met officer charged with Everard’s kidnap and murder appeared yesterday before Westminster magistrates court. Wayne Couzens, 48, who served in the Met’s armed diplomatic protection unit, spoke only to confirm his name, the address of his home in Deal, Kent, and his date of birth.</p> \n<p>Couzens sat in the dock as the court listened to the charges. He appeared to have a wound on the top of his forehead. Scotland Yard said he was twice taken to hospital for treatment after sustaining head injuries while being held alone in his cell. He is due to appear at the Old Bailey on Tuesday to answer charges of kidnap and murder.</p> \n<p>The personal stories of harassment and abuse will be used by the government to inform a summer package, designed to give greater protection to women and girls, which is being drawn up by Patel. Making sexual harassment in the street a specific offence is understood to be part of the measures being examined.</p> \n<p>However, Patel is under cross-party pressure to back a more radical, “once-in-a-generation” overhaul of laws. Labour will try to attach a series of reforms to the police, crime, courts and sentencing bill, currently being studied by MPs. Its proposals include increasing minimum sentences for rapists and stalkers and making misogyny a hate crime. It will also demand an independent review into increasing sentences for domestic murder, as well as providing stronger legal defences for domestic abuse survivors.</p> \n<p>David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, said: “The government should start by increasing sentences for the most serious criminals like stalkers and rapists, while working to drive up the appallingly low levels of convictions for sexual violence and domestic abuse.”</p> \n<p>Separately tomorrow, the House of Lords will vote on a proposal to force all police forces to log and monitor misogynistic crimes as hate crimes.</p> \n<p>Nokes said: “I don’t pretend making misogyny a hate crime would be legislatively easy, but we can’t tolerate things the way they currently are.</p> \n<p>“A quick trawl through my emails today let’s me know I’m an idiot, a stupid woman, the reason why men hate women. All sent by men who simply don’t accept or recognise they are part of the problem. So yes, making misogyny a hate crime seems a radical step, but not being radical hasn’t worked.”</p> \n<p>The Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has campaigned on the issue, said: “The strength of feeling the planned vigils showed about the need for change highlights that it’s time to stop asking women to stay indoors to be safe and start asking how we tackle violence against women. Making misogyny a hate crime has helped to transform the way some police forces deal with these issues – the vote [tomorrow] would mean all women in England and Wales benefit from this approach.”</p> \n<p>Patel said she was “determined to do all I can to prevent crimes which disproportionately affect women and girls”. She added: “The public outpouring of grief and anger in response to the tragic developments in the Sarah Everard investigation shows just how crucial it is that we seek the views of individuals whose experience can help prevent violence against women and girls.”</p> \n<p>At Saturday’s court hearing, Couzens was accused of kidnapping Everard in the Poynders Road area of Clapham. She went missing on 3 March after setting off at 9pm from a friend’s house to make her two and a half mile journey home.</p> \n<p>Zoe Martin, for the prosecution, said Everard called her boyfriend for around 14 minutes but there had been no further activity on her mobile phone since then. There were four sightings of Everard recorded by CCTV, a doorbell camera, a police car and bus camera. Everard’s boyfriend reported her missing the next day.</p> \n<p>After an appeal and a search, her remains were discovered in woodlands in Ashford in Kent last Wednesday.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor said her body was found in a large builder’s bag and formally identified using dental records.",False,pillar/news,News,['domestic violence']

Following the life and untimely death of a protagonist who tells his friends that they can “refer to him as either she or he, that he was both”, The Death of Vivek Oji was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/03/the-death-of-vivek-oji-by-akwaeke-emezi-review-a-painfully-invisible-existence"">praised in the Guardian for achieving</a> “what good fiction does best: it is an antidote to invisibility”.</p> <p>“Their origin story is that men were excluding them w/the Booker, so when Freshwater was longlisted, I hoped it was a sign that they gave thought to who *they* were excluding,” Emezi <a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com/azemezi/status/1313003554018332673"">wrote on Twitter</a>. But Emezi said the longlisting had “brought a ton of violent shit my way, they got quite some publicity from it, and decided to change ... nothing”.</p> <p>Emezi said that when Faber got in touch with the Women’s prize about submitting The Death of Vivek Oji, they were informed: “The information we would require from you regards Akwaeke Emezi’s sex as defined by law.”</p> <p>“Forget about me – I don’t want this prize – but anyone who uses this kind of language does not fuck with trans women either, so when they say it’s for women, they mean cis women,” wrote Emezi. “And yes, this does mean that them longlisting [Freshwater] was transphobic. It’s fine for me not to be eligible because I’m not a woman! But you not about to be out here on some ‘sex as defined by law’ like that’s not a weapon used against trans women.”</p> <p>The Women’s prize was established in response to the Booker failing to shortlist a single female writer in 1991. Following Emezi’s nomination in 2019, the organisers of the £30,000 award <a href=""https://www.thebookseller.com/news/womens-prize-longlist-akwaeke-emezi-longlist-gender-policy-980156"">said</a> it was working on a policy “around gender fluid, transgender and transgender non-binary writers”.</p> <p>Responding to Emezi’s comments, <a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com/WomensPrize/status/1313059947626848256"">the prize organisers said</a> that their terms and conditions for entry equated the word “woman” with “a cis woman, a transgender woman or anyone who is legally defined as a woman or of the female sex”.</p> <p>“As a prize which celebrates the voices of women and the experience of being a woman in all its varied forms, we are proud to include as eligible for submission full-length novels written in English by all women,” said chair of trustees Joanna Prior. “In our terms and conditions, the word ‘woman’ equates to a cis woman, a transgender woman or anyone who is legally defined as a woman or of the female sex. The trustees of the Women’s Prize Trust would like to reassert that we are firmly opposed to any form of discrimination or prejudice on the basis of race, sexuality or gender identity.”</p> <p><a href=""https://thestellaprize.com.au/prize/guidelines-submission/statement-on-gender/"">In Australia, the Stella prize for women’s writing</a> takes entries from trans women, non-binary and cis women writers and does not require any statement beyond an author’s self identification, because “we recognise that what it means to be a woman is not static”.

She said in a statement that the deadly strike “was taken without the consultation of Congress.”</p> <p>“The full Congress must be immediately briefed on this serious situation and on the next steps under consideration by the administration, including the significant escalation of the deployment of additional troops to the region,” Pelosi said.</p> <p>Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said the lack of consultation with Congress can lead to “hasty and ill-considered decisions”, and warned that the administration would need congressional approval before going to war with Iran.</p> <p>“When the security of the nation is at stake, decisions must not be made in a vacuum,” Schumer said. “It is paramount for administrations to get an outside view to prevent groupthink.”</p> <p>But <a href=""https://video.foxnews.com/v/6119473601001#sp=show-clips"">speaking to Fox News,</a> the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally who was seen at Mar-a-Lago earlier in the week, said he “was briefed about the potential operation when I was down in Florida”.</p> <p>“This was a pre-emptive defensive strike that planned to take out the organizer of attacks yet to come.

Since March 2020, many of us have experienced <a href=""https://theconversation.com/strange-physical-symptoms-blame-the-chronic-stress-of-life-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-139096"">physical manifestations of stress</a> that correspond to living through a global pandemic. From <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/feb/05/pandemic-burnout-rise-uk-latest-covid-lockdowns-take-toll"">low energy</a> and headaches to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/feb/14/pandemic-has-had-negative-impact-on-mental-health-poll"">changes in mood</a> and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/30/our-pandemic-subconscious-why-we-seem-to-be-dreaming-much-more-and-often-of-insects"">disrupted sleep</a>, our rhythms are deeply upset. And many women have experienced changes to a fundamental rhythm: the menstrual cycle.</p> <p>Rachel Burns has always experienced premenstrual syndrome (PMS), but it has been even more difficult to navigate in the past 12 months. “I always have a few days of feeling quite withdrawn before my period, but this has morphed into me feeling unreachable and anxious for over a week,” says the 36-year-old from Kent. “My partner says the change is significant.” Before Christmas, her PMS made her feel as if she were “going mad, like a panic attack I couldn’t come down from”. The effects of her period drag on now. She feels fluey, achy, “completely depleted, physically and emotionally”. As a result, it can feel like she “only has one ‘good’ week” a month. “It’s like being at sea within yourself,” she says.</p> <p>When the gynaecologist Dr Anita Singh (who writes and podcasts as <a href=""https://www.gynaegeek.com/"">the Gynae Geek</a>) posted an informal survey on Instagram in May, asking if women had noticed changes to their cycles or hormonal symptoms, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CAHxSfXJ6WD/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"">65% of the 5,677 respondents said yes</a>. A study (not yet peer reviewed) carried out by sports scientists and the bioanalytics company Orreco showed that <a href=""https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250919v1"">53% of 749 women surveyed on the characteristics of their menstrual cycle reported changes</a>, such as changes in mood and longer cycles than usual.</p> <p>To understand what may be happening, we need to think about the basic mechanisms of the menstrual cycle. In a 28-day cycle, ovulation will occur on about day 14. The empty follicle from which the egg pops out will form something called a <em>corpus luteum –</em> a temporary gland that produces high levels of the hormone progesterone (and lower levels of oestrogen) to prepare the uterus for pregnancy if the egg is fertilised. If it isn’t, the <em>corpus luteum</em> breaks down, causing progesterone and oestrogen levels to fall. This begins about a week before the period, on day 21.</p> <p>The drop in these hormones can affect brain chemicals including serotonin. Many women who experience bad PMS find that, once bleeding begins and hormone levels stabilise, their symptoms disappear. But hormones are only a part of the picture.</p> <p>“PMS is not purely biological, because the same process of rising and falling oestrogen and progesterone happens to everyone who has a cycle and we are not all affected in the same way,” says the consultant gynaecologist Dr Heather Currie, the associate medical director at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary. “Women with PMS do not have abnormal levels of hormones, but appear to be more sensitive to the changing levels of progesterone and oestrogen.”</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>It is important for women to try to recognise what is going on in their lives that could be making their symptoms worse</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What causes some women to be more sensitive than others is a million-dollar question. There is early evidence to suggest that<a href=""https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/sex-hormone-sensitive-gene-complex-linked-premenstrual-mood-disorder""> some women may have a genetic vulnerability to being affected by hormonal changes</a>, particularly with premenstrual dysphoric disorder, a more severe experience of PMS. “The degree to which changing hormone levels will affect someone will probably be informed by her psychological wellbeing at that time,” says Currie. “So, if we already know that life events can make PMS symptoms feel worse, that tells us something about what is happening during something as all-consuming and life-changing as a global pandemic.”</p> <p>George Pearce, 29, is a teacher in Southampton. She has had a 28-day cycle for many years and can “usually time my period to within one or two days”. Things have changed. “I will bleed for a few days, then it stops. Then it will start again, then I won’t bleed again for six weeks. It’s like even my period can’t be bothered!” Pearce says that she has never been a particularly anxious person, but feels “like a coiled spring. It’s like a weird sort of hum. I’m ruminating on things more than usual, though, as I’m obviously spending a lot more time in my own head. There’s nowhere else to go.”</p> <p>Persistent stress leaves us suspended in fight-or-flight mode. In threatening situations, a hormonal pathway in the body called the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which links the brain with the adrenal glands, encourages the release of the stress hormone cortisol – preparing us to respond to the threat.</p> <p>However, if the brain is telling the body it needs to “respond” all the time (to anxious thoughts, changing circumstances, the stress of home schooling, the impact of loneliness, illness or bereavement), unregulated cortisol can suppress the normal levels of reproductive hormones in the body. This can lead to abnormal ovulation, which will disrupt the cycle – or even pause it altogether.</p> <p>“It is important for women to try to recognise what else is going on in their lives that could be making their symptoms feel worse,” says Currie. Even our experience of period pain, which can be simply understood as the walls of the womb vigorously contracting to help the lining shed, can be affected by our emotional state. Studies have also<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18484442/""> linked painful periods to working in insecure jobs with little emotional support</a>, which speaks to evidence showing that<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128009512000534""> stress can deepen our perception of pain</a>. Pain can be stressful; stress can be painful. There is no membrane between the physical and emotional.</p> <p>The absence of our usual distractions and coping strategies make escaping – or accepting and getting on with – our thoughts more difficult. “There is no release valve,” says Dr Sue Ward, a consultant gynaecologist and a vice-president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. “So many of us are miserable. Any condition that has a psychological element will have surely been made worse by lockdown. It is a perfect storm and the body can tell the story of stress in so many ways.”</p> <p>Ward believes we shouldn’t underestimate the impact of women being unable to get together and vent, either. “Being able to talk about our health and emotional issues with each other legitimises what we’re thinking. Having the space to laugh takes the sting out of things. We seek solutions and affirmation from fellow women and so many of us haven’t been able to have that.” Domestic burdens and the inability to escape our partners may also make us feel exposed in a way we haven’t before.</p> <p>During the second lockdown, Sarah Adams, 35, approached her GP to discuss what felt like worsening PMS. “I have experienced disconnection and sadness in the second half of my cycle for years, which I’ve known needed addressing, but the volume of my self-critical voice this past year has become so loud that it can be scary.” She attributes this, in part, to “not being able to take the feelings anywhere, like the library, swimming pool or pub”.</p> <p>Adams lives in east London and runs a shop with her boyfriend. Until they had to close, they purposely arranged their schedules so that they wouldn’t work together all the time. Now, she says, they are “stuck together 24/7”. “Women are so predisposed to analysing our own behaviour and thinking about how we are perceived. Self-doubt flourishes when we can’t be around other women. You lose sense of what is normal or understandable.”</p> <p>The same is true for those who live alone. Sam Davies, 38, is a product manager who lives in Hertfordshire. She says she has always experienced some form of PMS. But living alone for the first six months of the pandemic “exacerbated everything. I kept having this overwhelming feeling of being stuck; with my feelings, in my house, alone.” For Davies, PMS is usually characterised by depressive feelings. “I feel hopeless, headachey and very tearful, but also have quite angry, intrusive thoughts and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia"">misophonia</a> [extreme sensitivity to sounds].” She is working with a private therapist, which is helping. “It’s hard to know whether my PMS during lockdown has become worse because of changes in routine and higher stress levels, or whether my ability to cope generally has changed. Maybe it’s both.”</p> <p>A perverse upside to the pandemic is that it has presented an opportunity to reappraise what “stress” actually means and how starkly it can affect the body. If our periods have gone haywire over the past year, this is probably a response to prevailing stress; a signal from the body to think about what tools and habits might nurture our emotional wellbeing. Once life returns to something resembling normal, routines are easier to maintain and we are able to calm down, it is likely that erratic menstrual cycles will calm down, too.</p> <p><em>Names and some identifying details have been changed.</em",False,pillar/news,News,['women killed over honor']

But, after a tumultuous 12 months in Spanish politics that saw two general elections and months of political manoeuvring before a government could be formed, the swearing-in last week of Pedro Sánchez’s leftwing coalition has seen the issue return.</p> <p>In the latest exchange between the two sides, the academy declared on Thursday it was “grammatically unacceptable” for Yolanda Díaz and Irene Montero of the junior coalition partner, Unidas Podemos, to refer to the government’s cabinet (a council of minsters) as a <em>consejo de ministras</em>, instead of the approved <em>consejo de ministros</em>. It said the former would only be applicable if the cabinet were all-female, something that has never happened.</p> <p>Calvo disagrees. “It’s time the constitution had a language that respects both genders,” she said. “It only has masculine language and this isn’t appropriate in a modern democracy.”</p> <p>In common with many gender-based languages, Spanish defaults to a generic masculine when it isn’t specified whether the subject is male or female. For example, a girl is a <em>niña</em> and a boy a <em>niño</em>, but collectively children are <em>niños</em>.</p> <p>One solution hit upon by supporters of inclusive language is to “double up” on genders so that “the neighbourhood children” becomes “the neighbourhood boys and girls”, but such innovations can infuriate traditionalists. Montero, the equality minister, was ridiculed when she referred to a spokeswoman (<em>portavoz</em>) as a <em>portavoza </em>because <em>voz</em> is a feminine noun, whether it pertains to a man or a woman. Rewriting the constitution to be more inclusive would entail replacing about 500 words and considerable doubling up, starting with “Spanish citizens” – <em>ciudadanos</em>/<em>ciudadanas</em> <em>españoles</em>/<em>españolas</em>.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""0d1c35d7d9c8a740bb6de5f387f967eda4738c4c""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/0d1c35d7d9c8a740bb6de5f387f967eda4738c4c/0_149_3508_2104/1000.jpg"" alt=""Feminism flowered in 1930s Spain with figures like Dolores Ibárruri (La Passionaria)."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Feminism flowered in 1930s Spain with figures like Dolores Ibárruri (La Passionaria).</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The conservative-minded academy has so far managed to evade the question but has previously defended the gender neutrality of masculine nouns. “Doubling up is artificial and unnecessary from a linguistic perspective,” it said in an official statement. “In the case of nouns that describe living beings it is possible to use the generic masculine to designate the type of being, that is to say, all of the individuals of the species, regardless of sex. The explicit use of the feminine is only justified when the opposition of the sexes is relevant.”</p> <p>Sources at the academy claim the government’s demand is politically rather than linguistically motivated. “We think inclusive language is the language we habitually speak,” said one member.</p> <p>The battle over language is only the latest fought by Spanish feminists, whose movement flowered in the 1930s during the second republic when women such as Clara Campoamor campaigned for women’s suffrage and Dolores Ibárruri, better known as La Passionaria, was a leader of the Communist party and the anti-fascist movement.</p> <p>When the fascist victory in 1939 installed a Catholic dictatorship, feminism was delayed but has since been making up for lost time. In fact, the first feminist congress was held just 17 days after General Franco’s death in 1975.</p> <p>Today, the spokeswomen for the #MeToo movement in the European parliament, Amelia Martínez Lobo and Arantxa Calvera, are both Spanish. Now, in what is considered its fourth wave, the movement has become more militant, especially in the wake of two recent and notorious <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/men-accused-of-raping-girl-in-spanish-town-convicted-of-lesser"" title="""">gang-rape cases</a> where the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/23/wolf-pack-case-spain-feminism-far-right-vox"" title="""">judges ruled</a> that the victim’s passivity implied consent.</p> <p>Over the past two years this growing militancy has seen millions of women take to the streets on <a href=""https://www.internationalwomensday.com/"" title="""">International Women’s Day</a>, which takes place on 8 March this year. The movement’s main focus is on sexual consent, equal pay, parental leave and violence against women.</p> <p>The language issue may seem odd to some British feminists. On the one hand, Spanish activists want to replace the generic masculine by doubling up. On the other, they insist on denoting gender in words like <em>juez</em>/<em>jueza</em> (judge) and <em>alcalde</em>/<em>alcaldesa</em> (mayor), precisely the sort of distinction – mayoress, conductress – that their British counterparts have opposed as unnecessary.",False,pillar/news,News,['gang-rape']

High quality AP and PRUs can and do turn young lives around.</p> <p>“But they cannot do what they do best if children aren’t in class. It is a sad fact that these children are often preyed upon. Getting children engaged and into the classroom is so important – for their safety and to help them make the right life choices.” She said that the reality of referral units and APs was often very different to the common perception that the institutions were steering children towards gangs and exploitation. She said more than 80% of registered state-funded providers were rated as good or better by Ofsted.</p> <p>Meanwhile there are also concerns about the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/oct/20/coronavirus-400000-children-in-england-off-school-in-one-week"" title="""">levels of attendance at mainstream secondary schools</a>. Teaching unions warned of a “collapse” in attendance after official figures showed that more than one in five pupils in England missed school two weeks ago.</p> <p>While attending classes for a few hours each week marks an improvement for some children who have been excluded from their previous school, Spielman said that expectations should be set higher for daily attendance at PRUs. She said the most successful settings for excluded pupils had shown impressive results.</p> <p>Harmonize Academy, an AP free school in Liverpool that works with children who have been excluded or are at risk of being excluded, improved pupils’ attendance by more than 20% on average when they joined – the equivalent of an extra day a week in school. Marie McConville, its principal, said that there was a common misconception about what excluded students could achieve.</p> <p>“As soon as you mention alternative provision, people think it’s just a little shed somewhere and the students doing the same thing every day, they’re not making any progress – that those students are certainly not attending and then getting involved with criminal activity and gangs,” she said. “It’s certainly not like that here. We offer many subjects and we’re in a nice school building. We have small classes with a maximum of nine per class, we have really outstanding teachers. Students are attending every day, achieving more qualifications than they would in mainstream education.</p> <p>“The attendance is really important here. I do agree with Amanda Spielman when she says attendance is crucial. We say to students that they need to be in school everyday in order to succeed. If a student is struggling to manage their anger, or dealing with suicidal thoughts or depression, or they have a lot of issues that they need to get through in order for them to be able to learn, they can see our clinical psychologist once a week. They get lots of additional support. We tell them that we are outstanding because they’re outstanding, and it may be the first time that they’ve had that recognition.”",False,pillar/news,News,['gang-rape']

The book <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/24/naomi-wolf-admits-blunder-over-victorians-and-sodomy-executions"">first ran into trouble</a> when it was published as a hardback in 2019, when Wolf, the author of The Beauty Myth, was confronted during a BBC radio broadcast by the historian Dr Matthew Sweet. Sweet pointed out that she had misunderstood the term “death recorded” in historical records. Wolf had believed it signified an execution, and claimed that she had found “several dozen executions” of gay men after the last recorded execution for sodomy in 1835. However, the term reflects a crime punishable by death that was commuted to a custodial sentence, a common occurrence. The book was subsequently pulled and pulped in the US, and corrected in the UK by Wolf’s publisher, Virago.</p> <p>Now Sweet and historian Dr Fern Riddell have responded to the corrected paperback edition, accusing Wolf of citing cases of men found guilty of sexually assaulting children and animals as examples of a wider persecution of gay men in consensual relationships.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/non-fiction/blind-bestiality-paedophilia-naomi-wolfs-latest-book-outrage/"">In a blistering article in the Telegraph</a> (£), Sweet pointed to Wolf’s depiction of John Spencer, a man who she describes as “tried three times, accused of sex with three different men”. Sweet’s article says that Spencer was a school headmaster who was accused of sexually assaulting a group of schoolchildren and <a href=""https://www.digitalpanopticon.org/life?id=obpdef1-609-18600709"">found guilty on one count</a>, according to contemporaneous newspaper reports and Old Bailey records from 1860.</p> <p>“The names of these boys do not feature in Outrages: Sex, Censorship, and the Criminalisation of Love. But John Spencer is present – offered to the reader as a victim of the Victorian state. A man whose love was criminalised,” Sweet writes.</p> <p><a href=""https://twitter.com/FernRiddell/status/1357801162586660873"">Writing on Twitter,</a> Riddell said she had “never been so angry about a book in my entire career”.</p> <p>“One of the most moving and heartbreaking bits of this story is the first-hand testimony of these boys. We find it difficult enough to comprehend the bravery of someone facing their abuser in court today, IMAGINE doing it in the middle of the Victorian era,” she writes. “And their testimony isn’t hidden, it’s not sitting on a dusty book shelf in an archive somewhere, it’s digitised. Because it was reported in the newspapers.”</p> <p>Wolf also cites the case of 14-year-old Thomas Silver, “‘indicted’ for an ‘unnatural offence’”, as being an example of teenagers being “convicted more often” for attempted sodomy. Both Sweet and Riddell pointed out that Silver <a href=""https://twitter.com/FernRiddell/status/1357798400226451458"">was charged with “indecently assaulting” a six-year-old boy in 1859.</a> In the book, Wolf claims that Symonds “would have read about what happened to teenagers such as Thomas Silver when word about their intimacy with other boys got out.”</p> <p>Stephen Alexander and William Tibble, cited by Wolf as teenagers charged with attempted sodomy, <a href=""https://twitter.com/FernRiddell/status/1357828880380346371"">were recorded as having assaulted animals</a>, Riddell said, as were three other cases in the book, according to court records. Wolf cites these examples as part of a building crackdown, writing: “That year, more teenage boys than ever before were sent, alone, to the dark and brutal prison at the Old Bailey.”</p> <p><a href=""https://twitter.com/FernRiddell/status/1357828880380346371"">Riddell commented</a>: “In reality, they were NOT teenage boys convicted of consensual gay relationships. They both assaulted animals. And AGAIN, do you know how easily I found this? In minutes, on a publicly accessible archive.”</p> <p>Sweet informed Wolf that several of the cases involved sexual assaults on children or animals during the Radio 3 interview in 2019. “The second edition removed references to executions after 1835 but still represented these cases and many others as consensual,” he said on Monday.</p> <p>Riddell said that Wolf had “knowingly ignored” evidence to depict paedophiles as consensual gay men, and that publisher Virago should have “check[ed] every case” before going to press on the paperback.</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, Wolf said that her book had been reviewed and checked “by leading scholars in the field”, and that “it is clear that I have accurately represented the position”.</p> <p>“My claim that a homosexual man in the 19th century in Britain would be subject to, and no doubt fearful of, prosecution under sodomy laws, and that sodomy laws included consenting adult acts, child abuse, sexual assault and even bestiality, is correct and not a misrepresentation of any sort,” said Wolf.</p> <p>In a later statement, she added: “Dr Matthew Sweet and I are actually trying to prove different points. Dr Sweet thinks it’s important to show that there were child victims and of course it is and there were, but I wanted to show how there was a climate of fear and that there was no distinction in law between consenting and violent male-male sex. The difference is a matter of emphasis.”</p> <p>She acknowledged that Sweet was correct about Spencer and William Mepham, another man named in Outrages who was prosecuted for sexual assault of a child, but said such information would have been “found in the records of the time of which Symonds himself was unlikely to have been aware.”</p> <p>Outrages was inspired by Wolf’s 2015 PhD thesis at the University of Oxford, which said that a “statement of clarification” to her thesis had been submitted, reviewed and approved, and “will be available for consultation in the Bodleian Library in due course”.</p> <p>In a statement, Virago said it “is satisfied that Naomi Wolf had her book checked by scholars of the period.”",False,pillar/arts,Arts,"['child abuse', 'sexual assault', 'sexual abuse']"

She was one of a dozen women who had sexual relationships with men who pretended to be their companions and allies in order to spy on their political activities. They courageously fought for justice, yet last night parliament passed a bill making it legal for undercover MI5 agents and police officers to commit crimes – including sexual assault, torture and murder – if this prevents a more serious crime or threat to national security. Only 20 Labour MPs <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/05/mi5-bill-prompts-second-labour-rebellion-in-two-weeks-jeremy-corbyn"">voted against the bill</a>, defying Keir Starmer’s instruction to abstain.</p> <p>Very few would dispute the need for undercover informants to break the law in certain circumstances to keep us safe. Campaigners have long argued for a legal framework for criminal acts committed by undercover agents, but while <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bill-c-51-bars-csis-from-committing-bodily-harm-sexual-violation-1.2938380"">Canada prohibits </a>undercover agents from engaging in killing, bodily harm or sexual assault, no such limits have been enshrined in UK law. The Human Rights Act exists as a safeguard against such offences, protests the government: an entirely disingenuous argument given that, as Reprieve’s executive director Anna Yearley tells me, “just a few months ago in court, and again last week in parliament, it argued that the act doesn’t apply to crimes committed by its agents”. Future survivors of abuses committed by undercover officers will be barred from seeking justice, because their abusers will be protected from civil liability for the rest of their lives.</p> <p>It’s not scaremongering to claim that agents of the British state could commit crimes against the very people they have been tasked with keeping safe. Eight years ago, then prime minister David Cameron apologised to the House of Commons for “<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/12/david-cameron-pat-finucane-murder"">shocking levels of collusion</a>” between agents of the British state and the loyalist murderers of Belfast lawyer Pat Finucane.</p> <p>Some groups are more vulnerable than others to secretive infiltration, threatening citizens’ democratic right to protest against government action. According to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2018/oct/15/uk-political-groups-spied-on-undercover-police-list"">research</a> by the Guardian, of the more than 1,000 groups targeted by undercover police in the last five decades, just three belonged to the far right. The vast majority hailed from the left, and included trade unionists and climate activists. One of the three tests an authorising officer must be satisfied has been passed is to safeguard “the interests of the economic wellbeing of the UK”. Agents of the state could commit offences to defend business interests from, for example, campaigners desperately trying to urge action to confront the climate emergency.</p> <p>If a police force wished to search a property for evidence, they would need to seek a warrant. But, as organisations such as Reprieve and the Pat Finucane Centre point out, the bill includes no system of warrants or independent judicial approval for the authorisation of crimes, meaning crimes by agents would be subject to even weaker oversight than phone tapping or searches by law enforcement.</p> <p>Rather than protecting our security, the bill could further threaten it. I have interviewed several <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/09/undercover-police-female-activists-inquiry-farce"">women who were violated</a> by undercover police officers. There were striking similarities in all their cases: the agent would concoct a story of having fallen out with or lost their family, and towards the end of their mission, would become withdrawn before leaving a note on the table ending the relationship. At meetings they would frequently take minutes – handy for intelligence gathering – and often possessed a large white van, allowing them to drop all activists back at their homes each evening and, in the process, find out their addresses. They would also often pose as the most radical, urging the most militant actions. As Labour’s former shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti tells me, the legislation “creates even greater temptations for agents provocateurs to incite peaceful protest movements into violent action. Those agents will know they are shielded from a British rule of law that was always supposed to apply to everyone equally”.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/sep/24/uk-set-to-introduce-bill-allowing-mi5-agents-to-break-the-law"">UK set to introduce bill allowing MI5 agents to break the law</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Starmer’s champions would undoubtedly rebut the idea that the former human rights lawyer would ever be sanguine about such dangerous infringements on rights and freedoms.<strong> </strong>The party’s argument goes like this: providing a legal framework for criminal acts committed by undercover agents is necessary, and Labour will propose amendments to deal with the bill’s pernicious elements.</p> <p>But cynics would suggest that a political calculation is at play. Labour cannot hope to overcome an 80-seat majority by ordering its MPs to vote against the bill, and some senior Labour figures brief that this posture is necessary to win back the former <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/working-class-voters-desert-labour-stoke-on-trent-england-red-wall"">red wall</a> heartlands, where voters, they believe, need to be convinced of the party’s commitment to national security. Those same shadow ministers and their advisers applied the same logic just two weeks earlier when Labour also abstained on the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/20/overseas-operations-bill-uk-government-bend-rules-torture-soldiers"">overseas operations bill</a>.</p> <p>However, accepting the government’s terms of debate is no way to conduct an opposition. Voting against the bill would have granted Labour the political authority to make an unambiguous and compelling argument to the electorate about the Conservative menace to a hard-won democracy. Now the deed is done, Labour must back amendments suggested by Reprieve that would impose limits on offences that undercover agents can commit, to ensure oversight mechanisms, and to allow the prosecuting authorities to independently review crimes.</p> <p>It fell to a new generation of Labour MPs – including Apsana Begum and Zarah Sultana, both in their 20s – to offer leadership in the Commons by offering powerful speeches before trooping through the empty parliamentary “no” lobby. For the second time in as many weeks, Labour offered a vacuum in place of leadership against state-sanctioned violence against civilians. It has paid a profound moral price, and conceded yet more ground to its opponents.</p> <p>• Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",False,pillar/opinion,Opinion,"['gender-based violence', 'sexual assault', 'domestic violence']"

Valerie was the manager of a community centre where Freshfields ran a legal advice centre.</p> <p>The <a href=""https://www.femicidecensus.org/"">Femicide Census</a> published three reports and then launched as an independent entity in 2019 directed by Clarrie and me.</p> <p>The census was born out of a unique set of circumstances – not many organisations start as we did. It’s an immense privilege to honour the women that we report on and they will always be the centre of our work. Wanting things to be different is a huge motivation for all of us who work on the project. Through the Femicide Census we have worked with some incredible people who have the tragedy of losing someone that they love in common. As the Femicide Census has progressed, it has never been less than painful and anger-making that I have to add the names of more women whose lives could have been saved.</p> <p>We’ve been further supported to develop the work through donations and a grant from the Treebeard Trust which has enabled us to employ some very dedicated part-time researchers. But the project is still run on a shoestring and Clarrie and I work voluntarily. We’d love to be able to dedicate more resources to the census – the more work we do the more we identify themes that warrant state action, or further investigation; for example, the high proportion of so-called “mercy killings” of older women and the number of hidden femicides, mis-crimed as accidents or suicide.</p> <p>In December 2020 we proposed to the <em>Observer</em> that we collaborate and launch a campaign, the paper drawing on the Femicide Census’s unique database of killings from 2009 to 2018 to expose the chronic fatal weaknesses across the system, involving all agencies, including police, local authorities, children’s services and probation.</p> <p>The three aims of the campaign are Name it; Know it; End it.</p> <p>‘Name it’ because unlike those of many countries, this government repeatedly fails to call the killing of women by men femicide, avoiding core issues such as the profound inequality in our society.</p> <p>‘Know it’ because data is inadequate and the numerous inquiries, coroners’ notes and recommendations by, for instance, domestic homicide reviews, are not kept in one easily accessed central repository, nor are recommendations to save women’s lives monitored and their implementation – or not – properly recorded and acted upon when there are failings.</p> <p>‘End it’ to expose what needs to change, how it can happen and what barriers stand in the way.</p> <p>Writing in our 10-year report on femicides between 2009 and 2015, Freshfields said: “Each Femicide Census report identifies stark patterns and trends in the killing of women by men. The creates an impact and a legacy rooted in one simple tried and tested premise: that information brings knowledge and knowledge can bring change.”</p> <p>We couldn’t agree more. We want our work to create change for women. We’re building an evidence base that supports what feminists have been saying for decades. It’s time for the government to stop ignoring the real extent of femicide and take action.",False,pillar/news,News,['women killed over honor']

So it was inevitable that the home secretary would be obliged to give a statement to MPs about the events on Clapham Common last Saturday after a serving officer was charged with the murder of Sarah Everard.</p> <p>And it was just as inevitable that Priti Patel would navigate the entire session without giving much away about what she and the Metropolitan police commissioner had discussed in the run-up to the vigil. Though, despite drawing attention to her Saturday night tweet of the “upsetting footage”, she did manage to convey the impression that she couldn’t quite see what all the fuss was about. The vigil had been banned beforehand and the police were just doing their best to implement the coronavirus restrictions.</p> <p>That aside, this was one of Patel’s better – a low bar, I know – performances in the Commons chamber. Better in that she was by-and-large coherent even if she didn’t have much to say. She, like all MPs, began by offering her sincere condolences to Everard’s family and friends before going on to say she had set up an inquiry into the policing of Saturday’s event and that she would wait for its report in a couple of weeks’ time before commenting further. Instead, she drew attention to the domestic abuse bill that is due to become law next month and would offer greater protection for women.</p> <p>In reply, the shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, agreed with much of what Patel had said about the need for society – and men in particular – to change so that women felt safe out on the streets at night. Where he took issue with her was on the details of the policing of the vigil. Something had gone chronically wrong, he said, for it to end in violence, adding that the crime bill, that was due to receive its second reading later the same evening, would only make things worse by banning protests. In its 296 pages, there were eight references to attacks on statues that carried a maximum sentence of 10 years, while rape cases started with a minimum sentence of five years.</p> <p>“The right to protest is a fundamental liberty,” Patel insisted. Just so long as it wasn’t done in a way that was noisy or annoying to her. From now on, any protest must be done in a whisper – preferably between 11 and 11.15 in the morning – and only be on government-approved topics. Such as the colour scheme of the new £2.6m Downing Street media suite. Were the blue walls just a bit too bright? Were four union jacks behind the podium quite enough? Should the person who designed the logo so that Downing Street reads “Dow Reet” get a life sentence? Should the Henry Hoover be replaced with a Dyson in recognition of the inventor’s important contribution to Brexit? And had No 10 spent too much of lockdown watching repeats of The West Wing?</p> <p>Patel did find time to suggest she found it curious that Labour could complain about the low rate of rape convictions while voting against a bill that would increase the minimum tariff for the crime. She has yet to understand that you have to vote for a bill as a whole and don’t get to cherrypick the bits you like. Baby steps and all that, though she did imply to Yvette Cooper that she was minded to follow up the chair of the home affairs select committee’s recommendation for a register of serial stalkers.</p> <p>Otherwise, the home secretary did her best to deflect accusations – from her own benches as well as the opposition – that the police response had been heavy-handed, lacking in empathy and disproportionate. She had been in discussions with the Met on the Friday and Saturday before the event, she admitted, though it had completely slipped her mind just what those conversations had been about. </p> <p>Everything had been fine for eight hours or so at the vigil, Tory Fay Jones added helpfully, and then a peaceful event had been hijacked by militants with “All Cops Are Bastards” placards. Yes, that was exactly it, Priti Vacant agreed, before remembering that she had been urging everyone not to prejudge the findings of the inquiry she had called. Conservative Charles Walker wasn’t having this. MPs were to blame, he said. They had criminalised freedom of protest and were up to their neck in it. Now was the time to lift all the coronavirus restrictions so that people were free to do whatever they liked. Patel wasn’t the only one to look startled by this intervention. It’s not often that she isn’t the most bat-shit crazy person in the room.",False,pillar/news,News,['rape']

Barnhill faces harsh scrutiny, allegations of racial bias and a state investigation over his handling of the case and why he recommended not bringing charges shortly before officially recusing himself. </p> <p>Barnhill defended his office’s handling of the Arbery case.</p> <p>“As a member of the State Bar of Georgia I am not allowed by State Law and State Bar rules to have any public comment on the facts, or on the law, or on the news stories about the case, to ensure a fair and just trial for all parties,” he said in an emailed statement. “As far as any investigation into my office’s handling of the case; I welcome the investigation and look forward to the review.”</p> <p>Court documents obtained by the Guardian reveal that just months before Barnhill advised against charging both men, his office aggressively opposed a motion filed on behalf of a 53-year-old African American woman, Sheila Denton, requesting a new trial due to flawed forensic evidence used to convict her of a 2004 murder.</p> <p>Denton was sentenced to life in prison in 2006 for the murder of 73-year-old Eugene Garner, but she has maintained her innocence. Her prosecution, first brought by Barnhill’s predecessor in the district attorney’s office, relied heavily on “bite mark” evidence and the account of a sole witness who defense lawyers said gave conflicting evidence and was heavily pressured by local police into testifying against Denton. Court filings indicate police threatened the witness, Sharon Jones, with being charged over murder herself unless she testified that Denton had confessed to her. Jones was a known crack cocaine dealer and drug addict.</p> <p>An autopsy on Garner’s body identified a potential bite mark, which was used alongside a photograph of Denton’s arm, which prosecutors argued also showed an alleged bite mark, to deduce Denton had carried out the murder. There was no DNA evidence linking her to the case.</p> <p>Although forensic dentistry experts testified at trial that the markings were “probable bite marks” that linked the two together, <a href=""http://abfo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ABFO-Bitemark-Standards-03162016.pdf"">guidance issued</a> by the American Board of Forensic Odontology (ABFO) in 2016, which strictly limited testimony on “probabilistic” bite markings, essentially nullified the critical evidence from the 2006 trial.</p> <p>Despite this, attorneys working for Barnhill argued in court filings in December 2019 that the new ABFO guidance was “not evidence at all” and the court should continue to rely on the old, flawed testimony because the forensic dentist who testified in 2006 “would not change the opinion he offered”. The motion was written by the assistant district attorney Michelle McIntire, who reports to Barnhill.</p> <p>Ultimately, on 7 February this year, just two weeks before the Arbery shooting, Judge Dwayne Gillis disagreed with Barnhill’s office and allowed Denton a new trial, later ordering her release from prison.</p> <p>Denton was <a href=""https://www.innocenceproject.org/sheila-denton-is-freed-after-15-years-of-wrongful-imprisonment/"">released</a> on 9 April but remains under indictment.</p> <p>Sources close to the case told the Guardian that Barnhill indicated, at around the same time he advised against charging the McMichaels, that he would continue to examine pursuing a new case against Denton.</p> <p>Barnhill said in an email that the original trial was “many years ago” and he was not personally involved. He said his office had agreed to a low bond for Denton after a new trial was ordered so she could live with family in Atlanta.</p> <p>In recent years Barnhill also drew <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/opinion/election-voting-rights-fraud-prosecutions.html"">national attention</a> for his decision to prosecute Olivia Pearson, the first African American woman elected to the city commission in Douglas, Georgia, and three others for improperly assisting others at the polls during the 2012 general election. The three other people pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges, but Pearson chose to take her case to trial.</p> <p>Georgia restricts who can get assistance at the polls and Barnhill’s office brought felony charges against Pearson, saying she had unlawfully helped <a href=""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/joelanderson/how-georgias-voter-fraud-fight-could-make-this-grandmother-a"">her nephew</a> and another woman at the polls and signed a form swearing that the voters met the necessary conditions for assistance when they didn’t.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>I was just blown away that I got indicted on something like that. They aggressively prosecuted me</p> <footer> <cite>Olivia Pearson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But during the trial, one of the women Pearson helped, a first-time voter, testified that she didn’t know how to use the voting machine, <a href=""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/joelanderson/this-is-what-happened-when-a-georgia-grandmother-went-on"">according to BuzzFeed News</a>. She said Pearson showed her how to do so without touching the machine or telling her how to vote.</p> <p>“I was just blown away that I got indicted on something like that,” said Pearson “They aggressively prosecuted me.”</p> <p>All but one of the jurors, a black woman, voted to convict Pearson, resulting in a mistrial. Barnhill’s office immediately moved to try the case again. In the second trial, held in another town, the jury acquitted Pearson after just 20 minutes of deliberation.</p> <p>The fact that the group was prosecuted after encouraging people to vote was stunning, said Charlene Green, an attorney who represented one of the men who pleaded guilty. Many saw the prosecutions as an attempt to intimidate minority voters.</p> <p>“These are not people who are a blight on the community. These are individuals who are actively working to galvanize marginalized people in that community,” she said. </p> <p>Some noted it was alarming that Barnhill so aggressively brought prosecutions for minuscule voting infractions but didn’t think charges were warranted in Arbery’s case, where there was video evidence showing two men chasing down an unarmed man and shooting him.</p> <p>“When you look at the fact pattern that has come to light in Mr Arbery’s case, that this same DA looked at that video and decided that there was no probable cause to prosecute, it says to me that his judgment is informed by race discrimination,” said Sara Totonchi, executive director of the Southern Center for Human Rights, which represented Pearson in her second trial.</p> <p>Barnhill said he did not have an active role in either of Pearson’s trials and that if people asked him about the case, he would tell them Pearson was not guilty.</p> <p>“I have a 36-year prosecution history which is open for inspection. I’m proud of the work I’ve done,” he said.</p> <p>Barnhill has spent almost his entire career as a prosecutor in the Waycross judicial circuit, a jurisdiction situated across six counties in rural south-east Georgia. According to biographies in local news, he began tenure as an assistant district attorney in June 1983, rising to chief assistant district attorney in 1994.</p> <p>Archives indicate that Barnhill has been a mainstay on the local Republican political scene for many years. He was elected to district attorney in 2014 in a close and, at times, bitterly fought battle with a second Republican candidate, Brad Collins.</p> <p>Local news reports from the time indicate that Barnhill campaigned on a harsh, tough-on-crime agenda and touted his active support of capital punishment. According to one story in the Waycross Journal-Herald, he also once blamed “high numbers of pirates and unfriendly Indians” from Georgia’s colonial past for the state’s “criminal element”.",False,pillar/news,News,['woman+murder']

The committee’s chair dismissed the notion as a “soundbite”.</p> <p>“What exactly does an Australian-style points-based system mean?” Prof Alan Manning, the chair of the committee, asked. “The problem is that it means different things to different people.”</p> <p>Instead its experts recommended a mixed system, which would rely on a minimum salary threshold for those people coming to the UK with a job offer, and a points-based system for skilled workers coming to the UK without an arranged job. “Talented individuals” would be able to apply for a work visa under this points-based system.</p> <p>The committee’s detailed recommendations would reduce levels of immigration, the size of the UK population and total GDP, Manning said. “We expect the changes to very slightly increase GDP per capita, productivity and improve public finances, though these estimates are more uncertain,” the report states. “The changes are also expected to reduce pressures on the NHS, schools and on social housing, though they will increase pressure on social care.”</p> <p>Downing Street indicated it was unlikely to notably change course on its immigration plans as a result of the report.</p>  <figure class=""element element-atom""> <gu-atom data-atom-id=""5dd78891-e3db-4501-9452-9c2dbfa77686""         data-atom-type=""guide""    > </gu-atom> </figure>   <p>The committee was asked by the home secretary, Priti Patel, last year to research how an Australian points-based system might work. The government is not required to accept its recommendations but is now under pressure to clarify its own vision for a post-Brexit immigration system, which will be governed by the same rules for people inside and outside the EU.</p> <p>The committee urged politicians to act fast, pointing out that there is not much time left to devise and implement an overhauled system if employers are to have time before the end of the transition period to plan for substantial changes to how they recruit staff.</p> <p>The government has alluded to the desirability of an Australian-style system for months, without explaining how this might work. This report gives the first assessment of whether it provides a suitable model for the UK economy.</p> <p>If the government wants a points-based system it should only introduce it for skilled workers without a job offer, the committee concludes. Currently the main way in to the UK for non-EU migrants requires them to have a job. Skilled migrants who come to the UK to take up a job would be allowed to earn £4,400 less than the current £30,000 threshold for non-EU workers, under the proposals.</p> <p>The committee has recommended reducing the existing salary threshold to £25,600 to make it easier for teachers, NHS employees and people at the start of their careers to qualify. The committee recommends higher thresholds for more highly paid occupations.</p> <p>Manning said: “No perfect system exists and there are unavoidable, difficult trade-offs. The largest impacts will be in low-wage sectors and the government needs to be clear about its plans for lower-skilled work migration.”</p> <p>He warned the government to ensure that the mistakes of previous UK points-based systems were not repeated, noting that the UK did have something “pretty close to an Australian points-based system from 2008 and the current system has evolved away from that because of perceived problems with it”.</p> <p>A No 10 spokesman said: “The government will introduce a firmer and fairer points-based immigration system from 2021 that welcomes talent from around the world while reducing low-skilled migrants and bringing overall numbers down. We will carefully consider the report before setting out further details on the new system.”</p> <p>Asked if this meant the plans for a primarily points-based system would stay, he said: “As the prime minister has been clear, we will introduce our points-based system from 2021.”</p> <p>The Federation of Small Businesses gave a cautious welcome to the recommendation but proposed that the minimum income threshold be set at around £20,000. “The recommendation for a route to the UK without a job offer is also positive, but this must be open to mid-skilled workers and not restricted to highly paid professionals,” it said.</p> <p>The Food and Drink Federation, whose members rely heavily on EU citizens to staff food production sites where British workers are in short supply, said the salary threshold was still too high. It said it was “a step in the right direction” but urged the government to “consider going further still”.</p> <p>EU nationals make up a quarter of the 430,000-strong workforce in food and drink manufacturing and many businesses will be recruiting under immigration rules for the first time, said the FDF.</p> <p>London First, which represents some of the capital’s biggest employers, said it was “positive”. But, like many employers, it believes it is unrealistic to set a salary threshold so high when many businesses rely on recruiting staff who earn less than £25,000 a year, including cleaners, security and waiting staff.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/26/fast-track-global-talent-visa-brexit"">Fast-track \'global talent visa\' to be launched days after Brexit</a> </p> </aside",False,pillar/news,News,['gender-based violence']

At the same time in Italy, Marta Felicina Faccio, who later became a leading feminist, published her first book under the pseudonym Sibilla Aleramo. <em>A Woman</em> is a groundbreaking, earthquaking vision, a story and a manifesto, and a literary performance so energetic it almost demands to be read aloud.</p> <p>As a child, the narrator – who is unnamed, though the novel is essentially a memoir of Aleramo’s early life – worships her father and disregards her mother: which is where the trouble begins. How could it be otherwise? Her father is the source of knowledge, of money, of all that seems valuable; her mother is “readily prone to tears, while my father could not bear the sight of them”. When the family moves from Milan to southern Italy, things get worse. In a shocking, disorienting scene, her mother tries to take her own life and never fully recovers.</p> <p>The girl’s own struggles have barely begun. Helping in her father’s factory at the age of 15, she attracts the attention of a worker, who rapes her. This overturns her thinking to the point that she wonders, “Did I belong to this man now?”, ultimately marries him, and they later have a son together. Yet it is from this experience that she begins to see that the self often works against its own interests; that by favouring her father over her mother “I had never stopped to imagine my future life as a woman”. It leads to a suicide attempt of her own.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Readers who like to underline striking passages will need to keep their pencils sharp</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But from this crisis comes an awakening, delivered in prose that ascends to a higher and higher pitch, eventually leaping out with such force that the words almost crash on to the opposite page. “Blessed tears! At last I had got a hold of myself; at last I had accepted the hard task of walking alone, of struggling alone, of bringing into the light everything within me that was unpolished, beautiful and strong.” Readers who like to underline striking passages will need to keep their pencils sharp.</p> <p>The narrator’s desire to progress “alone” is a challenge not just to marriage but to parenthood – “the mother in me could not be reconciled with the whole woman” – and she finally understands her own mother, who had experienced precisely the same difficulty. “Why,” she says, delivering the book’s central message, “do we idealise self-sacrifice in mothers? Where does this inhuman idea of maternal self-immolation come from? It has been passed down from mother to daughter for centuries. It has produced a monstrous causal chain.”</p> <p>As the title suggests, <em>A Woman</em> (in a new translation by Simon Carnell and Erica Segre; the book has been out of print since 1982) seeks to be both individual and universal, and its influence echoes still. The chain image was adopted by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/elena-ferrante"">Elena Ferrante</a> in her novel <em>The Lost Daughter</em>: “All the hopes of my youth seemed to have been destroyed, I seemed to be falling backward toward my mother, my grandmother, the chain of mute, angry women I came from.”</p> <p>This is a human story as well as a political one, and there is the blackest of comedy in scenes where, following her suicide attempt, the narrator’s sister-in-law asks her to sign a legal statement confirming that her husband was not to blame. But the greatest sadness comes when the tension between motherhood and “the better self that I had neglected” causes an inevitable crisis, revealing the book’s purpose. Aleramo left her son when he was aged six, in 1902, and wrote <em>A Woman</em> “so that my words will reach him”. It was more than 30 years before she would see him again.</p> <p>• <em>A Woman</em> by Sibilla Aleramo (translated by Simon Carnell and Erica Segre) is published by Penguin Modern Classics (£9.99).

The autumn/winter 2020 show, on Friday evening in Milan, seemed to continue on a theme. The screen over the catwalk projected a virtual audience made of different Donatella Versaces – the high priestess of the brand. This time, however, there was a difference. Once the screen faded to black, the show began – and it introduced men. This was the first time the brand has featured an equal number of men and women on the catwalk, moving towards the idea of dressing beyond gender.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""8811770309db53587b9f86c4d16dff3c96722f27""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/8811770309db53587b9f86c4d16dff3c96722f27/0_0_3167_4751/667.jpg"" alt=""Man on the catwalk for Versace"" width=""667"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Versace featured an equal number of men and women on the catwalk, moving towards the idea of dressing beyond gender.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: WWD/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In theory, anyway. There was some crossover in design – suiting for both men and women, and some more streetwear-influenced pieces including wide-leg trousers and bomber jackets that typically feature across the wardrobes of men and women. Both carried the handbags and wore preppy sweaters. But there was also some serious glamour, this is a Versace show after all. That might be with a crystal-studded shirt worn by a male model or a short chainmail strapless gown worn by Kendall Jenner, a male model in blazer and jeans worthy of John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, or Gigi Hadid in a slinky slipdress. Across various different sections of the show, masculine and feminine archetypes were very much present.</p> <p>At a press conference before the show, Donatella Versace did not begin by discussing the clothes. Instead, she spoke about what she referred to as “hate crimes, all over the world”, urging the assembled journalists to work against them. “We all have a voice and we must use it,” she said. Referring to the Hanau attack, in which nine people were killed in a shooting rampage by a suspected rightwing extremist, she said: “What happened in Germany, we need to act and we need to be fast.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""edb6bbe0e0b7e180dabc54ad6ecc4e2047987b75""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/edb6bbe0e0b7e180dabc54ad6ecc4e2047987b75/0_0_2545_3818/667.jpg"" alt=""Gigi Hadid on the catwalk for Versace’s fall/winter 2020 show a Milan fashion week"" width=""667"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Gigi Hadid on the catwalk for Versace’s Fall/Winter 2020 show a Milan fashion week</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Swan Gallet/WWD/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moving to the collection, she explained that the introduction of men had come about because she wanted to “highlight the new generation does not care about gender, [for them] it is about having a point of view … What I tried to show in this collection is that sexuality comes from the brain first.”</p> <p>While a show with both men’s and womenswear switches things up a bit in terms of visuals, it doesn’t quite reach the majesty and surprise of September’s show: Lopez in a version of the split-to-the-thigh tropical print dress she wore to the Grammies in 2000. Or the 2017 reunion of the supermodels Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer, Carla Bruni and Helena Christensen. Perhaps making the inclusion of menswear the story is less about buzz and more a commercial decision. Menswear continues to be a growing market for fashion. According to Euromonitor, men’s clothing sales will grow 1.9% in 2021 compared to 1.4% for womenswear. Logically, it’s time for men to share the stage with women.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""71bf475ea8aad6c42fb34baeb8e0f27175709227""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/71bf475ea8aad6c42fb34baeb8e0f27175709227/0_0_3047_4571/667.jpg"" alt=""Masculine and feminine archetypes were present during the show."" width=""667"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Masculine and feminine archetypes were present during the show.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: WWD/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earlier this month, Capri Holdings, the group that has owned Versace since the end of 2018, revealed revenues across the group (which also owns Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo) had rrisen 9.2% to £1.22bn, with Versace’s sales of £150m ahead of expectations. Speaking to Vogue Business, Jessica Ramirez, a retail analyst at Jane Hali &amp; Associates, said this was due to the brand connecting with younger consumers, adding, “the marketing of the brand has helped to create hype around its products.”",False,pillar/lifestyle,Lifestyle,['gender-based violence']

The 43-year-old chef had just opened <a href=""https://temperrestaurant.com/about-2/"" title="""">Temper</a>, a barbecue joint in Soho built around a six metre-long fire pit, which was the biggest in London and perhaps in any restaurant anywhere. Whole beasts were brought in, butchered and grilled theatrically in thick slabs over the embers. As the <em>Observer</em>’s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/11/temper-restaurant-review-jay-rayner"" title="""">Jay Rayner noted (admiringly)</a>: “There is a menu, but they could just replace it with a massive sign stamped with the word MEAT!, alongside one of those comedy boxing gloves on an extending arm which keeps punching you in the face until you surrender.”</p> <p>Rankin was in many respects an obvious target for vegan ire. With his elaborate tatts, brawny forearms and trucker cap, he was a poster boy for the strange but powerful barbecue fixation that took hold a few years ago; before Temper, he worked variously as a chef at Pitt Cue Co, Smokehouse and Bad Egg. He’d also just spent two years smoking, braising and grilling to produce a bible for carnivores titled <em><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/08/tips-and-recipes-for-barbecue-food"" title="""">Low and Slow: How to Cook Meat</a></em>. “I’ve cooked 15 goats all at once,” Rankin says, flecks of Edinburgh in his voice. “I’ve butchered many animals in my time.”</p> <p>So when the vegans came after him on social media, Rankin wasn’t surprised or especially bothered. Those at the “extremist” end, he ignored – “There’s no grey area,” he reasoned, “you’re evil, you’re wrong, that’s it” – but others, he’d debate. One in particular, a university lecturer on food issues, he became friendly with and they went out for dinner. Rankin pointed out that, unlike most steakhouses, his use of entire carcasses respected animals and minimised offcuts, but on certain issues he was swayed. “I was part of a group of people who made barbecue big again in the UK and I’m not too sure if that was a good thing,” he concedes now. “It was an interesting eye-opener to my own ethics and what I was doing.”</p> <p>Rankin is telling me this in a vegan restaurant. His zero-waste vegan restaurant, in fact: <a href=""https://www.simplicityburger.london/"" title="""">Simplicity Burger</a> on Brick Lane in east London, across the street from the famous bagel shops. When we meet, he’s almost completed Veganuary. Rankin estimates that he probably hasn’t bought meat to cook at home for two-and-a-half years. It’s like Richard Dawkins confiding that maybe he was a bit hasty writing off the whole God thing.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""a79ba78810d5713ca05681f1e5ed5b17e7464e11""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/a79ba78810d5713ca05681f1e5ed5b17e7464e11/0_0_4134_2759/1000.jpg"" alt=""Chef Neil Rankin"" width=""1000"" height=""667"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Chef Neil Rankin, who launched meat‑lover’s paradise Temper in Soho, now also runs a zero‑waste vegan restaurant in east London.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Daniel Hambury/Evening Standard/eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Either that or Rankin is very canny at predicting and leading food trends. There is disagreement over the popularity of veganism in the UK: most estimates put it at a little over 1% of the population. But there is clearly unprecedented awareness and press coverage of it. This year, 400,000 people globally <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/03/veganuary-signed-up-record-400000-people-campaign-reveals"" title="""">signed up</a> for Veganuary, compared with 250,000 in 2019. Not long ago, the big supermarkets might have a sorry corner with some Quorn and Linda McCartney products; as of last month, when Sainsbury’s joined the club, they all have own-brand plant-based ranges, as well as many stocking the likes of the Meatless Farm Co, Vivera and Oumph!. There’s everything from fake turkey to vegetarian “ham”, and even <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/13/pork-free-scratchings-classic-pub-snack-gets-a-vegan-makeover"" title="""">vegan pork scratchings</a>, made from flash-fried soya pieces, which received 174% funding on <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/veganpig/the-worlds-first-vegan-pork-scratching"" title="""">Kickstarter</a> last year. The global demand for plant-based protein has grown from <a href=""https://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/Article/2017/05/10/Meat-substitute-market-to-reach-4.bn-globally"" title="""">£2.9bn in 2015</a> to a predicted £4bn this year.</p> <p>One area of undisputed growth is plant-based convenience food. The Vegan Society <a href=""https://www.vegansociety.com/news/media/statistics"" title="""">calls it</a> “the UK’s fastest-growing takeaway choice”, having exploded by 388% (from, admittedly, a low base) between 2016 and 2018. A tipping point was the release last year of the Greggs vegan sausage roll, which, thanks to Piers Morgan, clever use of social media and the fact that it doesn’t taste awful, has brought a new audience to plant-based meat alternatives. Greggs doesn’t talk about specific sales, only that the “huge popularity” of its vegan sausage roll – and, this year’s releases, the vegan steak bake and a doughnut – have driven total sales to rise by 13.5%. Last month, the company announced it would pay its 25,000 employees <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/08/greggs-to-pay-workers-7m-bonus-after-vegan-sausage-roll-success"" title="""">bonuses totalling £7m</a>, or up to £300 each.</p> <p>Plant-based food is now even raiding the spiritual castle of the meat pie: the football ground. When Chelsea played Arsenal last month, supporters at Stamford Bridge could warm themselves at half-time with a vegan doner kebab or buffalo cauli wings at the Premier League’s first fully vegan kiosk.</p> <p>Much of the demand in the fast-food sector is for fake burgers, with restaurants lasciviously telling vegans and flexitarians – meat-reducers, essentially – that theirs “ooze” and “bleed” just like the real thing. Anyone doubting there is serious money in this sector need only look at the US company Beyond Meat, which supplies smaller UK chains such as Honest, Neat Burger and Halo Burger but also All Bar Ones, Premier Inns and Toby Carverys. In July last year, Beyond Meat briefly had a market valuation of $11.7bn (£9bn).</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""d8073cc58377745f294a657d26cd36a876b8db7e""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/d8073cc58377745f294a657d26cd36a876b8db7e/0_51_6720_4032/1000.jpg"" alt=""A board announces the launch of the vegan steak bake outside a Manchester branch of Greggs."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A board announces the launch of the vegan steak bake outside a Manchester branch of Greggs.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Rankin set out to make his plant-based Simplicity Burger he did not want to make a product that would appeal to vegans.

There were times when I was pulling my hair out. Times I gave up. But when I finally nailed it, that was a good feeling. I was like, ‘Thank god I didn’t have to add some weird chemical.’”</p> <p>Rankin is in some senses a late arrival at the plant-based party. But the difference, he believes, is that he has approached the challenge as a chef, not as a food scientist, wellness guru or tech entrepreneur. For example, the cheese for the Simplicity Burger could have been a simple vegan cheese: it might not have tasted of much, but it would have melted and provided a familiar texture. Instead, Rankin decided to extract the liquid from vegan cheese and replace it with fermented tomato water, fried onion oil and pickle juice. The result is quite mind-bending: it’s cheese that tastes not of cheese, but faintly of a cheeseburger.</p> <p>The reason that many chefs have been slow to engage with vegan food, Rankin suggests, is hubris. “Because it’s not cool,” he says. “I’ve taken a lot of flak for it. I get laughed at. I go to these little chef things and they go, ‘How’s your vegan thing? Haha!’ And I’m like, ‘How’s your restaurant that does fuck all for nobody apart from your own ego?’”</p> <p>Still, Rankin knows, from years sweating over a fire pit, how deep and primal our love of meat is and how difficult it will be to convince the doubters. “There’s a cultural identity to it,” says Rankin. “If you take that scene in <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, where Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta come into the room and he’s eating the burger and he tries it and says, ‘This <em>is</em> a tasty burger…’ You can’t replace that scene with a falafel and get away with it.”</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Rankin’s Simplicity Burger is indeed a tasty burger. The first mouthful delivers a dense, satisfying umami whoomph I haven’t tasted before from plant-based fast food. That’s not to imply that I’m tricked into thinking I’m eating a beef burger: it doesn’t fall apart in your mouth in quite the same way. But that’s not a criticism of Rankin; it’s just an acknowledgment that replicating meat is an outsize, maybe even impossible, culinary and scientific challenge.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""2f32a3d8d34dade37253501c04432fd5b676beb9""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/2f32a3d8d34dade37253501c04432fd5b676beb9/0_274_1600_2000/800.jpg"" alt=""Clare Every, a vegan food blogger, checks out the menu at Simplicity Burger."" width=""800"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Clare Every, a vegan food blogger, checks out the menu at Simplicity Burger.

The meat browns – the Maillard reaction – and creates more than 4,000 different molecules, which are responsible for its distinctive look, texture, smell and flavour. Humans have found the taste of cooked meat irresistible for approximately two-and-a-half million years. Eating animals is the main reason our brains developed and our stomachs shrank and we no longer had to spend all day foraging for food.</p> <p>So why then, if it’s so difficult, are so many people trying to mimic meat with vegetables? The climate emergency is the most pressing reason. In the past half century, global meat production has increased by more than 400%. In the next 30 years, as the population nudges 10 billion, there are projections that demand for meat will double again. “And cows just take too long to grow,” says Simeon Van der Molen, who launched the plant-based manufacturer <a href=""https://movingmountainsfoods.com/"" title="""">Moving Mountains</a> in west London in 2015. “After three years, you get 1,000 kilograms of beef, but that’s a ridiculously long time.”</p> <p>Van der Molen, who is 47 years old and favours the Branson-casual entrepreneur uniform of open-necked shirt and running shoes, had no previous experience in the food industry; his other company, Ecozone, makes detergents. But he had an itch to try something different and he was hearing a lot of noise from the States about Beyond Meat and market leader <a href=""https://impossiblefoods.com/"" title="""">Impossible Foods</a>, which was founded by Pat Brown, a professor of biochemistry at Stanford University, and has a stated aim to make animal agriculture and deep-sea fishing redundant by 2035. Van der Molen also had personal reasons.</p> <p>“I went to the doctors and I had cholesterol at 6.9 and the doctor told me to stop eating burgers,” he recalls when we meet at the Moving Mountains co-working office in Chiswick. “Otherwise I was going to end up on statins all my life. So I went straight to the supermarket and, as you can imagine back in 2015, it wasn’t very tasty: the burgers were bean burgers, nut burgers. And for someone who has gone from eating a quarter pounder that’s juicy and succulent, having a burger that looks like a squashed falafel is just too much of a step.”</p> <p>In this regard, Van der Molen thinks he is typical. His research suggests that most Moving Mountains customers are either aged 15 to 25, “doing it for the environment and animal welfare”, or between 45 and 65 and driven by health reasons. “Because their doctors told them like they told me,” says Van der Molen. Women significantly outnumber men.</p> <p>Van der Molen started by speaking to food technologists. He paid for it from his own pocket; he also sold his collection of classic cars, including rare Bugattis and Teslas, plunging the money into the new company. The consultants suggested that oyster mushrooms, with their deep taste and fibrous texture, would make a good base for the first Moving Mountains burger. “I dislike mushrooms,” admits Van der Molen. “I was against it.” Nevertheless, they made up about 20% of the burger, and were supplemented by peas, potatoes, wheat and soy proteins, coconut oil and vitamin B12. The final touch was the addition of beetroot juice, which would give the illusion that the burger was “bleeding”.</p> <p>The Moving Mountains B12 burger was a hit. It was launched in February 2018 at Mildreds, a vegetarian and vegan restaurant in Dalston, east London, but there was a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/04/bleeding-vegan-b12-burger-marstons-uk-pub"" title="""">mainstream crossover</a> in September when all of Marston’s 400-plus food pubs began offering it. In 2019, Harvester followed, then Europe’s Hard Rock Cafes and the massive pub operators Stonegate and Mitchells &amp; Butlers.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""b0a8174cb097f48c6843c77376ed92e6dcecd6c1""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/b0a8174cb097f48c6843c77376ed92e6dcecd6c1/0_66_1000_600/1000.jpg"" alt=""The Moving Mountains B12 Burger, the meatless burger that ‘bleeds’."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The Moving Mountains B12 Burger, the meatless burger that ‘bleeds’.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Michael Michaels</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their secret? “Four words we never mention: vegan, vegetarian, meatless, meat-free,” says Van der Molen. “We have to be so firm sometimes with restaurants, top companies such as Hard Rock Cafe. Call it the Moving Mountains burger. Meat-free and meatless are all about what is missing from the product: ‘Meat free? What’s in it then? I don’t want it.’ So we want to promote this as plant-based meat. Even though it’s not technically meat, we can still call it what we want. And we want to promote what’s good about it, not what’s lacking.”</p> <p>This, Van der Molen contends, differentiates his product from, say, the Greggs vegan sausage roll and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/02/greggs-launches-meatless-steak-bake-beef-up-vegan-range"" title="""">meatless steak bake</a>. “A vegan sausage roll – again, you’re limiting it to the amount of people who are going to buy it,” says Van der Molen. “I have friends that would never go to Greggs and ask for the vegan sausage roll because they never ever want to use the word ‘vegan’ when they’re with their mates. And it’s the same in restaurants. They don’t want to say it. It’s still old school. It’s sissy. You don’t want to be associated with vegan.”</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--inline""> <blockquote> <p>You don\'t have to flavour it to make it taste of meat, because the cells are derived from animals</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Van der Molen always saw Moving Mountains as restaurant only. “I don’t really like supermarkets, what can I say?” he says, with a smirk. “I’ve worked with them most of my life.” He mellowed, however, and in late December last year, three of Moving Mountains’ plant-based products – a sausage burger, sausage and hot dog, though not the regular burger – became available in the frozen food aisle of Sainsbury’s.</p> <p>Plant-based is here to stay, insists Van der Molen, and will be a global phenomenon. Moving Mountains already sells in Australia, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong, but Van der Molen is eager this year to take on Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat in the US. He has especially high hopes for the Moving Mountains hot dog, which has a main ingredient of sunflower seeds. “No one’s been able to replicate that,” he says. “So where will the plant-based market and Moving Mountains be in two years? We probably could be meeting in New York, I think.”</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>As you enter <a href=""https://www.unitydiner.co.uk/"" title="""">Unity Diner</a> in Spitalfields, east London, there is a large neon sign that reads: “The future is vegan.” On the menu, there are lots of ingredients my spellcheck is not happy about – cheeze, chikken, bakon and prawnz – as well as the Moving Mountains burger and hot dog. You can wash it down with a gin cocktail called Piers Morgan’s Tears, served with a straw made from wheat stems.</p> <p>I order the burger and my companion, Illtud Llyr Dunsford, selects a Moving Mountains hot dog with added prawnz: vegan surf’n’turf. If Rankin would be near the bottom of the list of people that you would expect to go into the market for meat alternatives, then Dunsford, a jolly, curious 39-year-old with a warm smile, isn’t far behind. His family has been farming in the Gwendraeth Valley, west Wales, for more than 300 years. Dunsford, meanwhile, was so inspired by the nose-to-tail philosophy of St John chef Fergus Henderson that in 2011 he set up a <a href=""https://www.visitwales.com/things-do/food-drink/food-producers/charcutier-ltd"" title="""">company called Charcutier</a> with the aim of making world-class air-dried ham from Welsh pedigree pigs. Dunsford knows his hot dogs, too: he used to supply them for Harrods. “One of my nicknames back then was the Sausage Dude,” he says. “Don’t know if that’s a good nickname or not.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""c6e89a641d866ed623a3c3b6372d8a4a2c5e363f""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/c6e89a641d866ed623a3c3b6372d8a4a2c5e363f/0_1_958_958/500.jpg"" alt=""The Unity Diner’s vegan Philly Cheezesteak sandwich."" width=""500"" height=""500"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The Unity Diner’s vegan Philly Cheezesteak sandwich.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Unity Diner/Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So what does Dunsford make of the Moving Mountains hot dog? “That’s surprisingly good,” he says, fighting an admirable battle to keep ketchup out of his thick, reddish-brown beard. “It tastes like a commodity product, a cheap product, the texture is a little bit too hard, but for me if this was a street-corner product it replaces it quite easily.”</p> <p>Praise then, but qualified. Dunsford can see scenarios in which plant-based simulacra can fill a gap – and for the planet that has to be so – but the notion that they can replace the real thing entirely is a stretch too far. “For me as a meat eater, there’s an organoleptic quality when you consume meat,” he says. “And none of these plant-based products offers exactly the same response. You don’t quite have that little glob of hot fat going down your chin you get with real meat.”</p> <p>For this reason, Dunsford believes the future of meat has to be growing it in labs from animal cells. His long, at times confounding journey to this conclusion began in 2015, when he attended a symposium on cultured meat at Maastricht University in the Netherlands and continued when he was chosen as a prestigious Nuffield farming scholar and spent 15 months travelling the world to explore the future of meat production, which included seeing the impact of animal agriculture on deforestation in the Amazon. But it all fell into place in late 2017, in the San Francisco headquarters of a US company Just, Inc (a building where Dunsford, a film buff, notes that <em>Toy Story</em> was screened for the first time).</p> <p>“They cooked me up a little duck liver chorizo,” he remembers. “It was in a little taco, it was tiny. And I ate it and it just had the umami kick of what I expect from meat. It was like this final piece of the jigsaw for me: this actually tastes exactly the same as meat. I thought, ‘Well, if you could produce that product cheaper, why on earth would a consumer buy something else instead?’”</p> <p>Charcutier was wound down and Dunsford now runs <a href=""https://www.cellularagriculture.co.uk/"" title="""">Cellular Agriculture</a>, the first UK startup in the cell-based meat space, with Dr Marianne Ellis, whose day job is head of chemical engineering at the University of Bath. “Our machine at the moment produces milligrams worth of cells, so very, very small,” says Dunsford. “But by the end of the next two years, we’re looking at about 10 kilos for a cycle, which is about three weeks. And the aspiration really, in around five years, is to build factories that produce tonnages of cells.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""cbddf82c8d41f6fb81074fafa7b9f4ad5d92283f""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/cbddf82c8d41f6fb81074fafa7b9f4ad5d92283f/13_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg"" alt=""Scientists at work in the labs Illtud Llyr Dunsford’s company Cellular Agriculture."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Scientists at work in the labs Illtud Llyr Dunsford’s company Cellular Agriculture.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: cellularagriculture.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dunsford is well aware that cell-based meat has a yuck factor to overcome, but he’s confident that over time it will. And if it does, the potential market is huge: while he believes plant-based food will mainly appeal to flexitarians, vegetarians and vegans, who make up about 20% of the British population, cultured meat would be an option for everyone else, whether they plan to reduce their meat intake or not. “The difference with cell-based is that chemically it <em>is</em> meat,” says Dunsford. “There’s nothing that you have to do to it to flavour it to make it taste of meat, because the cells are derived from animals.”</p> <p>As an individual, Dunsford accepts that he should be the perfect target for meat alternatives: he buys local; he cares about sustainability; when he takes a flight, he offsets his carbon. “So I’m that kind of consumer and I’ve tried to do plant-based but I can’t,” he sighs. “It’s just my body and my mind are not strong enough. Even though I know there are a certain number of things that we need to do to help the planet, I’m weak. Most people are.”</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Cell-based meat is, as you would expect, divisive. For Rankin, it’s a future that he doesn’t care much to imagine. “One, growing meat in labs, that’s terrifying,” he says. “And two, we have sustainably produced meat in this country. It’s just the fact we are eating too much of it. The whole problem with meat is that we just need to replace 90% of what we eat with other things, then we can sustainably farm animals and the animals can sustainably add manure to the soil. That whole thing that we used to do 100 years ago, really effectively, can work again.”</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/19/cultured-meat-on-its-way-to-a-table-near-you-cultivated-cells-farming-society-ethics"">Out of the lab and into your frying pan: the advance of cultured meat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So Rankin doesn’t think lab-grown meat will find a market then? “Oh, I’m sure it will take off, but I’m just saying it’s going to be terrible for us,” he warns. “You look at history and as soon as we started to get labs or companies to do our diets for us or to feed us food it turned out incredibly badly every single time.”</p> <p>Van der Molen looked into cell-based meat before starting Moving Mountains. For him, the issue was not ethics, but timescale. “I met with the University of Bath and, as soon as I understood what was involved, I stopped that,” he says. Why? “It’s another 10 years away from now, I would guess, from being produced. Anyone who tells you it’s this year is wanting more money from a funding round in my opinion. And as well as caring for the planet, I’m also a businessman. I need to have a company and I need to get the company moving.”</p> <p>Still, Van der Molen agrees with Dunsford that ultimately the market for cell-based meat will far outstrip that of the plant-based sector. “A lot of people say, ‘Well, I won’t eat it’ and I say, ‘But you just might not have a choice, because these massive big meat producers will just force it upon you.’ They don’t necessarily care about the environment – though some certainly do – but the savings that they can possibly make from using cell-based as opposed to rearing cattle? Unbelievable.”</p> <p>So we will see cell-based meat in McDonald’s or Burger King? “Oh God, 100%,” Van der Molen replies. “Yeah, I just think it will dominate.”</p> <p>For Dunsford, the breakthrough product will likely be a hybrid of cell- and plant-based ingredients. “Because the cells actually taste of meat and plant-based doesn’t,” he says. “You have to think about things like a fish cake: a lot of that is potatoes. Think of a sausage, a lot of that is just filler. So it is the same principle as what we currently do with food products.”</p> <p>Everyone agrees – some with zeal, others resignation – that it’s not if meat production will change, but when and how. In 2016, Dunsford was asked by advisers at Downing Street to present his research on protein alternatives. At the end of the day, he walked down the Strand to catch his tube and started humming David Bowie’s Space Oddity. “The line ‘Take your protein pill…’ came into my mind,” Dunsford recalls. “And I was like, ‘That’s what I want to do next. I want to make a sausage in space! I want to build a system that will exist for space travel and for planet colonisation!’ That’s what will come of this technology.”",False,pillar/lifestyle,Lifestyle,['gender-based violence']

The main event will, of course, be outside Parliament House where we are expecting to see protestors and politicians interacting, and the crowd delivering a petition to the government. </p> \n  <p>The petition calls for the following:<br></p> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Full <strong>independent investigations</strong> into all cases of gendered violence and timely referrals to appropriate authorities. Full public accountability for findings.</li> \n   <li>Fully implement the 55 recommendations in the Australian Human Rights Commission’s <strong>Respect@Work report</strong> of the National Inquiry into Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces 2020.</li> \n   <li><strong>Lift public funding</strong> for gendered violence prevention to world’s best practice.</li> \n   <li>The enactment of <strong>a federal Gender Equality Act</strong> to promote gender equality. It should include a gender equity audit of Parliamentary practices.</li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>While some members of the government are expected to leave parliament house to speak with the protesters, so far no senior ministers have said they will make an appearance. (Dan Tehan did say he would meet with constituents from his electorate if they asked, but didn’t clarify if this meant in his office or out on the lawn). </p> \n  <p>Scott Morrison said he was too busy to leave the building but invited the leaders of the march to his office for a private audience. This offer has been rejected, with organiser Janine Hendry saying that protesters “have already come to the front door, now it’s up to the government to cross the threshold and come to us.”</p> \n  <blockquote class=""quoted""> \n   <p>We will not be meeting behind closed doors.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=""element element-tweet"" data-canonical-url=""https://twitter.com/janine_hendry/status/1371163776527966211""> \n   <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"">\n    <p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">We have already come to the front door, now it’s up to the Government to cross the threshold and come to us.

He has vehemently denied these allegations and the government has so far refused to consider an independent inquiry into the allegations after NSW police said they could not investigate.</p> \n  <p>There is also the incidence of defence minister <strong>Linda Reynolds </strong>calling former staffer <strong>Brittany Higgins</strong> a “lying cow” on the day Higgins went public with allegations that a fellow staffer raped her in Reynolds’ offices.</p> \n  <p>Reynolds has since clarified she was questioning Higgins’ allegation that the government did not provide her with enough support in the weeks after the alleged incident and not her account of the alleged attack itself. She has also paid compensation and issued a formal apology. </p> \n  <p>Now the protests are starting soon (most at 12pm) but if you are still keen to make an appearance, you can check out details for the major events below.</p> \n  <figure class=""element element-tweet"" data-canonical-url=""https://twitter.com/MatildaBoseley/status/1371240449453649922""> \n   <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"">\n    <p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">Here are the details of some of the major <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/March4Justice?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#March4Justice</a> events today, via <a href=""https://twitter.com/antissa?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@antissa</a> You can follow along with updates from across the country on the <a href=""https://twitter.com/GuardianAus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@GuardianAus</a> Australia live blog. <a href=""https://t.co/vE2dKHsSD4"">pic.twitter.com/vE2dKHsSD4</a></p>— Matilda Boseley (@MatildaBoseley) \n    <a href=""https://twitter.com/MatildaBoseley/status/1371240449453649922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">March 14, 2021</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2021-03-15T00:20:23.095Z"">at 12.20am GMT</time></p> \n</div",False,pillar/news,News,"['rape', 'sexual assault']"

Easing these rules would move more activity outdoors, which reduces viral transmission.”</p> <p>Regardless, in primetime on Monday night the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-we-should-start-asking-people-to-stop-wearing-masks-outside-it-makes-us-uncomfortable"">Fox News host</a> Tucker Carlson <a href=""https://www.mediaite.com/tv/tucker-carlson-urges-audience-to-call-the-police-immediately-if-they-see-kids-wearing-masks-outdoors/"">claimed</a> requiring children to wear masks outdoors was “child abuse”.</p> <p>Carlson also said “the only people who wear masks outside are zealots and neurotics” and said seeing a vaccinated person wear a mask outdoors was like “watching a grown man expose himself in public”.</p> <p>“Your response when you see children wearing masks as they play should be no different from your response to seeing someone beat a kid in Walmart,” he said.</p> <p>“Call the police immediately, contact child protective services. Keep calling until someone arrives. What you’re looking at is abuse, it’s child abuse and you are morally obligated to attempt to prevent it.”</p> <p>The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/children/protect-children.html"">advises</a> that children over the age of two “wear a mask correctly when in public and when around people they don’t live with”.</p> <p>Carlson also <a href=""https://www.mediaite.com/tv/tucker-carlson-urges-audience-to-call-the-police-immediately-if-they-see-kids-wearing-masks-outdoors/"">said</a>: “We have been shamefully passive in the face of all of this.”</p> <p>His remarks attracted widespread criticism.</p> <p>“This is really, really dangerous,” <a href=""https://twitter.com/asharangappa_/status/1386852356730490884?s=21"">tweeted</a> Asha Rangappa, a former FBI agent now a CNN analyst. “Listen to his tone of voice, and what he’s instructing. He’s moving from his viewers passively consuming his propaganda to having them act on it – against their neighbours. He’s testing his audience’s compliance.”</p> <p>Ruth Ben-Ghiat, the author of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/26/strongmen-review-ruth-ben-ghiat-donald-trump-fascism-hitler-mussolini-franco"">Strongmen</a>, a study of modern authoritarianism, called Carlson’s words “tragic and dangerous”.</p> <p>The influential Politico Playbook email said: “Seeing parents abide by CDC advice … is not a good reason to sic child protective services on strangers at your local big box store. And we’re pretty sure Carlson knows that, even if some of his viewers might not, which makes his appeal to snitch on mask wearers even worse.”</p> <p>Elizabeth Spiers, a progressive pollster and journalism professor at New York University, <a href=""https://twitter.com/espiers/status/1387020146678636545"">wrote</a>: “Looking forward to the first parent who sues Tucker Carlson because he’s inciting people to harass children who wear masks and calling CPS on their parents.</p> <p>“Calling CPS is something that should be done for legit reasons, not because you disagree with someone’s parenting methods.</p> <p>“It’s traumatizing for children, and it can result in children being separated from their parents while CPS tries to figure out what happened. Carlson is a horrible excuse for a human being and he’s endangering kids by suggesting that people do this.”</p> <p>Carlson is nonetheless <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/apr/24/tucker-carlson-mainstream-us-journalists"">an influential voice</a> on the right of the Republican party, a relentless magnet for controversy seen in some quarters as a potential presidential nominee in 2024 if Donald Trump doesn’t run.</p> <p>Recent <a href=""https://www.axios.com/politics-seniors-coronavirus-vaccine-hesitancy-123d5907-21a4-4663-9c56-4300f618e380.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top"">polling</a> shows Republicans to be more resistant to vaccinations than Democrats or independents.

So she’s not concerned about getting the virus. Yet she wears the mask anyway, and ostentatiously socially distances.</p> <p>“Why? Well, it’s all a charade, maintained for reasons that have nothing to do with science or public health. That’s all very obvious now.

It contained, she noted, the common misconception that Trevor McDonald was the first Black person to report the news on British TV after he joined ITN in 1973 and that Moira Stuart, on BBC News from 1981, was the first Black woman. In fact, said Blake-Hannah – an author, film-maker and former Jamaican senator – in 1968 she was one of three Thames Television on-camera reporters for the current affairs programme Today, presented by Eamonn Andrews. (<a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-54623417#:~:text=The%20first%20black%20TV%20reporter%3F&amp;text=Three%20years%20before%20Barbara%20Blake,Abrahams%2C%20as%20a%20trainee%20reporter"">The BBC had hired a Black trainee reporter</a>, Eric Anthony Abrahams, a few years earlier.)</p> <p>At the time her appointment made every daily newspaper, bar the Daily Express. Blake-Hannah claims the Express held out only because “they had a rule: no Black people on the front page”. “Shirley Bassey sang regularly and there were comedians, but we were allowed in an entertainment capacity, not as serious news people, delivering serious stories.”</p> <p>She reported five days a week, on everything from the closing-down sale of the Beatles’ Baker Street shop (“They gave away everything in the store, so you can imagine the riot”) to gang crime in the East End of London. But, after nine months, the producers told her abruptly that they would not be renewing her contract. Why? Because of the numerous calls and letters from viewers objecting to a Black person on TV. “It broke my heart,’” she says.</p> <p>Blake-Hannah is speaking to me from her home in Kingston, Jamaica, where she settled in 1972. She embraced Rastafari; the straightened, Vidal Sassoon-style bob of her 60s TV appearances has long been replaced by a leopard-print headwrap. Her only child, Makonnen Hannah, is nearby – he made headlines globally in 1998 when, as a 13-year-old, he was appointed the youngest-ever adviser to Jamaica’s Ministry of Commerce and Technology.</p> <p>Blake-Hannah was raised in an affluent part of the Jamaican capital by her father, Evon Blake, a prominent magazine editor. His work meant mixing with the great and the good, but she says he is best remembered as the man who desegregated the swimming pool of the affluent Myrtle Bank hotel, a favourite haunt of one of his employees. “This accountant would go and swim there every midday, but my father, his boss, couldn’t. So one day my father put on his swimsuit and dived in. The horror! The manager came and said: ‘Mr Blake, you have to get out of the pool.’ He said: ‘No. Call the manager, call the prime minister, call God!’ And that was it: he liberated that pool, and he liberated Jamaican tourism.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""7741b7353e7f7785f13abb136538d1e9306f2075""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/7741b7353e7f7785f13abb136538d1e9306f2075/19_136_3999_3681/1000.jpg"" alt=""Blake-Hannah with her Today colleagues Eamonn Andrews and Jane Probyn in 1968"" width=""1000"" height=""920"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">‘It was really wrong’ ...

She was dismissed after nine months due to racist complaints from viewers.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Larry Ellis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was never about the pool. The family had access to a pool and Blake-Hannah and her sister swam every morning. They were attended to by a cook, a gardener and a nursemaid and had places at the prestigious boarding school Hampton, alongside the daughters of the Caribbean elite. “There were 100 girls, only 10 of whom were Black, of whom my sister and I were the ‘blackest’,” she says.</p> <p>The young Blake-Hannah’s expensive education ended prematurely, however, just after her O-levels. “By then, my father’s finances had collapsed. He took me out and put me in secretarial school. I wept bitter tears, but it really turned out to be most useful.” By the time Blake-Hannah accepted a job offer in Britain – a bit-part in the 1965 film <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059269/"">A High Wind in Jamaica</a>, starring Anthony Quinn – her work experience already included journalism, copywriting for an advertising agency, hosting a TV quizshow, appearing in a pantomime and a spot of modelling.</p> <p>It was a good life, but she felt drawn to the “mother country”. “I’d been educated to be a Black Englishwoman. I could tell you the average rain rate for all of the Lake District and recite <a href=""https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45521/i-wandered-lonely-as-a-cloud"">Wordsworth’s poem to daffodils</a>. I spoke and wrote perfect English and I thought: ‘Well, apart from the disadvantage of brown skin, kinky hair and a broad nose, I would be quite OK, y’know?’”</p> <p>Britain did not offer the warm Commonwealth welcome she had hoped for. “The contempt was so visible all the time; that was a real shock,” she says. A shock, but hardly a surprise. “Slavery already taught us that, y’know? The white man will have contempt: you are his inferior and he doesn’t have to like you. So you’re kind of prepared.

They decided to continue the racism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The practical difficulties, however, were a shock. “Trying to get accommodation is really where it hit home,” she says. “No one would rent you anywhere decent. You had to be prepared to have the worst accommodation, in the worst parts of town.” In the end, she could find only a room in a house where she had to share the single bathroom with two families from India. “It was really awful to have to put up with life under those conditions,” she says.</p> <p>Work was easier to come by, although she had to start at the bottom. After a succession of temporary secretarial jobs, Blake-Hannah got a position at the PR company employed in the UK by Jamaica. In time, she began writing for the Sunday Times and felt herself embraced by a community, alongside the expat West Indian one.</p> <p>“I had a very good girlfriend – Celia Brayfield, who became a bestselling author – and we’d go to the parties that the Sunday Times and other journalists would give,” she says. Was she the only person of colour within that media circle? Probably, but the thought never occurred to her. “It was an artistic community; that was colourless, y’know? It didn’t matter. The Beatles had just gone to India, good heavens! So everybody was dressing in Indian clothes. It was a multicultural melting pot.” It offered respite from discrimination elsewhere. “You were aware of racism at all times. I think it was just this circle of people who had no hang-ups, no prejudices, that made life not too difficult.”</p> <p>By the mid-60s, the Black liberation movement was well under way, yet somehow it felt far removed from Blake-Hannah’s life in London. “The revolution was something that was happening in America,” she says. “‘Black is beautiful’, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/aug/31/black-power-the-fists-and-the-fury-that-shook-america-and-inspired-generations"">Black power</a>, Malcolm X, Stokely Carmichael; our Black brains started ticking over because of them, but the Black community on Ladbroke Grove was a place you tried your best to get away from, because you knew it was really the bottom and you weren’t accustomed to that; I certainly wasn’t.”</p> <p>It would take several more years – and a Rastafari awakening – before Blake-Hannah began to consider her place in this revolution. She moved in different circles to the activists such as the Mangrove nine, who were arrested for protesting against police harassment of the Mangrove restaurant in Notting Hill and then fought a landmark legal battle to highlight racism in the criminal justice system.<strong> </strong>“People asked me the other day if I was part of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/11/mangrove-isnt-simply-a-black-story-but-central-to-our-countrys-history"">the Mangrove uprising</a>. Mangrove was happening at the same time as I had my PR job. I took people to lunch, y’know, at restaurants on Kings Road. I didn’t take clients to lunch at the Mangrove.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""30b90cb308d0e8e4ad6ff5e6ee2892e2a1dd43a2""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/30b90cb308d0e8e4ad6ff5e6ee2892e2a1dd43a2/949_34_2699_2696/1000.jpg"" alt=""Barbara Blake-Hannah (right) modelling alongside the Jamaican actor Beryl Cunningham in 1967"" width=""1000"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Glittering CV ...

It doesn’t matter who’s asking them the questions,” she says. But being a journalist couldn’t protect her from racism within the media. “I remember a job in Birmingham; they asked me one morning: ‘Well, Barbara, if Black people are so great, how come they didn’t paint the Mona Lisa?’” She was speechless. “I didn’t have an answer. I didn’t know there was anything to compare to the Mona Lisa. I thought that Egypt was Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra, y’know? I didn’t know anything about Africa. Except that we had come from there as slaves. That’s all I knew.”</p> <p>One day in 1968, she was sent to report at the Houses of Parliament. “I remember being on a bus and passing by South Africa House in Trafalgar Square and white people using the N-word and shouting up at my face in the bus: ‘Go back home.’ This was the year of the bill proposing amendments to the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2015/dec/08/race-relations-act-50-years-ago-1965-uk"">Race Relations Act 1965</a>, making it illegal to refuse housing, employment or public services on the grounds of race. In March, Enoch Powell had delivered his infamous <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/enoch-powell-rivers-blood-legacy-wolverhampton"">“Rivers of Blood” speech</a> in objection to the bill. For Blake-Hannah, the timing of her dismissal from Today that year is significant. “Thames Television had a good opportunity to act on the Race Relations Act and they didn’t. They decided to continue the racism. I didn’t know it at the time – I couldn’t say anything – but, looking at it now, it was really wrong. They could easily have said [of the racist complaints]: ‘We don’t care.’” After being let go in such a manner, she says: “I realised there was no space for me in Britain.”</p> <p>She did find another job in TV, at Associated Television in Birmingham, but unrelenting racism interfered again with her work. No accommodation near her new job would accept a Black tenant, so she was forced to undertake an exhausting daily commute from London. In her 2008 letter to the Guardian, she recalled how she had to “listen without reacting when the production staff asked: ‘What ‘wog’ story are we doing today?’” On another occasion, she wrote, Powell agreed to do an interview with the station “on condition that ‘the Black girl’ was not there”.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""c63b04ade9b42bf7e05c0bb6fde169d098df3ba7""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/c63b04ade9b42bf7e05c0bb6fde169d098df3ba7/0_337_3684_2210/1000.jpg"" alt=""Barbara Blake-Hannah (right) in her role as cultural liaison for the Jamaican government, alongside Olivia Grange, the culture minister"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Britain’s loss, Jamaica’s gain ...

She decided to leave the UK. “The entire population of Jamaica tried to get into the cinema that premiere night. When the show was over, the best party I’ve ever been to in my life was held by the Jamaicans. I couldn’t wait to get back home … I did not look back.”</p> <p>What she did on her return was enough to fill many books – and illustrates just how much Britain lost. She produced several films, including the 1982 Channel 4 documentary Race, Rhetoric, Rastafari, and several books, including a 2010 memoir covering her time in Britain and an influential manual on home schooling. In 1984, she was elected as an independent senator, becoming the first Rastafarian to serve in the Jamaican parliament. She has always kept abreast of British news and now campaigns against what she calls “heartless” <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/dec/02/home-office-proceeds-with-disputed-jamaica-deportation-flight"">Home Office deportations to Jamaica</a> –<strong> </strong>which Priti Patel, the home secretary, last week promised to make <a href=""https://leftfootforward.org/2021/01/home-office-plans-to-cut-jail-time-needed-to-deport-offenders-and-boost-flight-numbers/"">a “regular drumbeat” of British life</a>.</p> <p>Blake-Hannah tells the story of <a href=""https://twitter.com/maybulman/status/1230048172489220096"">Treymane Brown</a>, a 25-year-old who left Jamaica for the UK as a six-year-old and was separated from his own six-year-old son when he was deported in 2017. While homeless in Jamaica, Brown saved a young boy from drowning in a gully. “All they could do was give him a hero’s award. He still has no job, no money and nowhere to live. None of them do. None of them have any connection with Jamaica except their genes.”</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>In 1984, she was elected as an independent senator, becoming the first Rastafarian to serve in the Jamaican parliament</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What shocks her most, however, is how little the British media have changed in the 50 years since she was sacked, lest the shade of her skin offend racists. “When Meghan [the Duchess of Sussex] was still in Britain, you’d see a story and go into the comments section … I could see into the minds of the people who would call in [to Today] and say: ‘Get that N-word off our screens!’ Those people still exist in Britain today.”</p> <p>Whether it is <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/28/uk-supermarkets-unite-after-sainsburys-advert-prompts-racist-backlash"">supermarkets’ TV adverts</a>, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/20/black-lives-matter-rightwing-media"">Black Lives Matter-themed dance performances</a> or <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/30/naga-munchetty-bbc-reverses-decision-to-censure-presenter"">breakfast news presenters being disciplined</a>, it often seems the racists in the audience complain louder and have their feelings considered more than the non-racist majority. “You know why? British people have never been taught the full story of their history … the Queen of England is a nice old lady, nuff respect, but when I see <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests"">Colston’s statue toppled</a> and I read the history of the <em>Royal </em>African Company … You all need to know your history! That will stop the arrogance and that will stop the racism.”</p> <p>Her own place in that history is being reclaimed. This year, the annual British Journalism awards awarded <a href=""https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/british-journalism-awards-winners-2020-fts-dan-mccrum-journalist-of-the-year/"">the inaugural Barbara Blake-Hannah prize</a> to the Independent’s Kuba Shand-Baptiste. The award for up-and-coming minority ethnic journalist also had the coolest prize – to fly out to Jamaica to meet Blake-Hannah. She is also part of Britain’s Black History Month curriculum and has received various lifetime achievement awards and an Order of Distinction from the Jamaican government. But the journalism award is, she says, particularly meaningful: “Every year, I will be remembered by all these beautiful Black, brown, Asian journalists. I am so honoured.”</p> <p>The advice she has for the recipients is the same as that for all who follow in her footsteps: “Learn your history. Don’t be like Barbara Blake when they said: ‘If Black people are so great, how come they never painted the Mona Lisa?’ Have an answer, because somebody’s gonna ask you. And then teach them something. Come into work one morning and say: ‘Hey, do you know that it’s Usain Bolt’s birthday today?’ Just once in a while, say something Black.”",False,pillar/news,News,"['forced marriage', 'forced abortion']"

Demand Justice, a progressive group focused on the Supreme Court, started an online petition calling for his retirement. </p> <p>“Tell Justice Breyer: Put the country first. Don’t risk your legacy to an uncertain political future.

Melissa Kentner told the court she heard one of the vehicle’s occupants shout “I got one” after the hitch struck Barbara.</p> <p>The force of the blow ruptured Kentner’s small intestine, and doctors carried out emergency surgery to repair the tear.</p> <p>Less than two weeks later, however, she was readmitted to hospital with stomach pains. Doctors diagnosed her with end-stage liver disease and discharged her at the end of March. Kentner died in palliative care on 4 July 2017</p> <p>“Although she was a very sick woman and she would have died from her liver disease, she would not have died when she did had she not been injured,” pathologist Dr Toby Rose told the court by Zoom. Her post-mortem analysis concluded that Kentner died of bronchopneumonia and acute chronic peritonitis.</p> <p>During the four-day trial, the defence said it was impossible to claim with certainty that the assault led to Kentner’s death, pointing to her pre-existing health conditions. The defence also denied that the assault was racially motivated – an argument that for many felt at odds with the grim legacy of the city’s history.</p> <p>For years, Thunder Bay has been known as the <a href=""https://www.sudbury.com/around-the-north/thunder-bay-has-by-far-the-most-per-capita-hate-crimes-reported-in-country-642702"">hate crime capital of Canada</a>, a designation it only recently gave away.</p> <p>Two independent reports in 2019 found widespread evidence of systemic racism within Thunder Bay’s force.</p> <p>One <a href=""http://oiprd.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/OIPRD-BrokenTrust-Final-Accessible-E.pdf"">found that systemic racism exists within the city’s police service “at an institutional level”</a> and that officers failed to properly investigate homicides or protect Indigenous peoples from hate crimes.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/30/ontario-inquest-first-nation-students-thunder-bay-racism"">Mysterious deaths highlight troubling lengths First Nations youth must go for an education</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A <a href=""https://tribunalsontario.ca/ocpc/reports/"">separate report</a> found that the city’s police had “failed to recognize and address systemic discrimination against the Indigenous community”.</p> <p>Thunder Bay’s police chief announced last year that the force would reopen investigations into the deaths of at least nine Indigenous people after significant flaws were found in their original investigations.</p> <p>Even the handling of high-profile prosecution of Bushby troubled many in the city.</p> <p>He was first charged with second-degree murder, but jury trials in Ontario have been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Crown agreed to try him on manslaughter charges, thereby avoiding the need for a jury. </p> <p>“We see this time and time again where violence against Indigenous people is not given the same level of care and attention in the Canadian justice system,” said Francis Kavanaugh, who represents 24 First Nations in the region, adding that he found it “difficult” to believe there wasn’t a “racial component” to the decision .</p> <p>Manslaughter convictions in Canada carry no minimum sentence, and a maximum of life in prison. </p> <p>Bushby’s sentencing hearing begins 9 February. Family and community impact statements are expected to be submitted and read during the hearing.",False,pillar/news,News,['woman+murder']

The 1972 measure known as Title IX bars sex discrimination in college athletics for schools that receive federal aid, but many schools don’t comply, and the NCAA is not subject to it. “That’s not a loophole, that’s all-hole,” said Bee.</p> <p>“The fact is, women’s NCAA basketball is an ‘if you build it they will come’ situation.

Like many of us, I am feeling desperate for some positives to hold on to. But to be clear, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/nov/18/boris-johnson-agrees-16bn-rise-in-defence-spending"">announcing</a> £16 billion on defence on international men’s day and then, on equal pay day, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/nov/20/rishi-sunak-warned-not-to-freeze-public-sector-pay-in-mini-budget"">briefing</a> a public-sector pay freeze for a mostly female labour force is not my idea of good news.</p> <p>But there are signs of hope when it comes to women and equality. The UK is at a <a href=""https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=dbe15227-4c02-4102-bbf2-dce0b415e729"">coronavirus crossroads</a> and, with the right decisions, we could accelerate towards parity at work and at home; or, if we get it wrong, we could turn the clock back decades for women. Which path will the government take?</p> <p>The shift to home working has been a game-changer for many employers. They are recognising that home working doesn’t undermine productivity but in fact enhances it. And many workers don’t want to go back to their old, office-based routine. But there are also many who cannot work from home because they are in a frontline job, because their employer won’t let them, or because working at home just isn’t practical for them. </p> <p>This is why we need to embed a culture of flexibility that enables employees to flex their hours and/or their location. Legislating to make all jobs flexible by default, unless there is a good business reason not to, would really embed this change and enable many more workers to benefit.</p> <p>Unpaid care work fell disproportionately on women’s shoulders even before the crisis, with <a href=""https://www.timeuse.org/node/10833"">mothers providing</a> 118 minutes of care for children a day compared with 67 minutes provided by fathers. But the gap has widened during the pandemic, with school and nursery closures having a huge impact on working mothers in particular. Even though fathers have doubled the time they spend caring for children, <a href=""https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14860"">mothers’ share of care</a> has increased by more. </p> <p>The reason for this inequality lies partly in the way parental leave is structured, with just two weeks of paid paternity leave for fathers compared with nine months’ paid maternity leave (plus three months unpaid) for mothers – most of which she can then choose to transfer to her partner. The presumption is that the mother is the primary carer. Instead we need to design a system that assumes equal responsibility in caring for children and creates a longer, better-paid period of leave reserved for fathers and second carers. This is a feature of the better performing parental leave systems around the world, and is long overdue in the UK.</p> <p>The Black Lives Matter movement is having a profound impact on our society and driving an intersectional approach to equality. All the data clearly shows that minority-ethnic communities have been hit hardest by Covid, not only in terms of health and wellbeing but also economically, owing to existing poverty and structural inequalities. There are signs that message may be getting through, but it has yet to result in meaningful change. </p> <p>The Fawcett Society’s 2017 <a href=""https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/gender-pay-by-ethnicity-britain"">Gender Pay Gap by Ethnicity</a> report found that at 26%, Pakistani and Bangladeshi women experienced the biggest pay gap with white British men, and at 24% the pay gap black African women see had barely shifted in 20 years. That is why we are calling for gender pay gap reporting – currently suspended because of the Covid pandemic – to be strengthened and reintroduced, and for ethnicity pay reporting to be introduced at the same time.</p> <p>We have all discovered how important caring roles are and why we must value them. So now must now see a corresponding investment in our social care and childcare infrastructure, valuing the care work that is done by the majority female labour force. As a minimum, we want to see all social care workers receive the real living wage together with improved terms and conditions; an end to precarious contracts; and entitlement to statutory sick pay. </p> <p>Our childcare sector is in crisis: one in six providers may not be in business by Christmas, rising to one in four in more deprived areas. The government has baled out the railways but has yet to do the same for childcare providers. Yet childcare is as much a part of our infrastructure as our transport system – investing in it would generate a return to the exchequer and support economic recovery. The comprehensive spending review next week is the perfect opportunity for the chancellor to show us that he finally gets it, and will do what it takes for childcare provision. But will he?</p> <p>Finally, on equal pay day we highlight the pay discrimination that still persists in our workplaces. Fifty years on from the Equal Pay Act, we are calling for women to have the <a href=""https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/why-women-need-a-right-to-know-shining-a-light-on-pay-discrimination"">right to know</a> what male colleagues are earning if they believe there may be pay discrimination. Without it, they simply cannot achieve pay equality. We can emerge from this crisis and achieve a more gender-equal future, but it requires a government with the political will do to it.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sam Smethers is chief executive of the Fawcett Society</p></li> </ul",False,pillar/opinion,Opinion,['gender-based violence']

Now, women refuse to be made to feel terrible about a common experience.At the last public speakout I went to at the House of Commons, one woman got up and said she felt guilty only “about having no guilt at all”.</p> <p>This matters now, as anti-choice and conservative politicians gather in the US to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/02/congress-supreme-court-roe-v-wade-appeal"" title="""">try to overturn Roe v Wade</a>. Meanwhile, in the UK, anti-choice types focus on time limits. We can never be complacent about our rights. The myths the anti-choice brigade promulgate about cancer, infertility and deep psychological trauma must be called out. They emphasise negative feelings, but on what basis? Illegal abortion kills.</p> <p>The TV and film producer <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/12/tony-garnett-tv-and-film-producer-dies-aged-83"" title="""">Tony Garnett</a> told us how it was: “During the Blitz in 1941, in the middle of the bombing, my mother had a back-street abortion. There was me and my little brother, and they thought another baby in those circumstances too much. A day or two later she died of galloping septicaemia, and 19 days after that my father, who couldn’t bear it, committed suicide.”</p> <p>My negative feelings came to the fore recently, when I saw someone with a trolley bag and a picture of the Virgin praying with rosaries outside a Marie Stopes clinic. I felt ashamed of her. But I have no shame for myself, and I do indeed have faith. In women.</p> <p>• Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist",False,pillar/opinion,Opinion,['forced abortion']

When she retreats to bed to tell husband Ted, he is disturbingly blase: “Honey, that’s the man. The man that comes every night and tries to kill us.” Ted manages to off the housebreaker with a pool cue, but his body disappears within seconds. The next night, and the next, May must do it all over again.</p> <p>As this Groundhog Day home invasion unspools, other characters display the same weird acceptance as Ted. More than the physical threat, it’s as if a new unfathomable reality is creeping in and violating her own. The police response is half-hearted and, adding to the conspiratorial air, Ted packs his bags after an argument: “I can’t change this. This is just how things are.” After these microaggressions, the next macro one is incoming; you might expect an <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/26/it-follows-review-horror-sex-death"">It Follows</a>-style air of inexorable dread to set in, but May remains upbeat. Grant also wrote the script as well as starring, and perhaps it’s this closeness to the core ideas that allows her to pivot spryly between romcom perkiness and a nauseated hesitancy that suggests the dislocation between normal life and its violent substrate.</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jqt5AwfSnzk""                                                                        >  <iframe height=""259"" width=""460"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Jqt5AwfSnzk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Towards the end, there’s a suggestion that May’s public tough-it-out credo – she is plugging a self-help book called Go It Alone – may be, in some sense, perpetuating these attacks. Possibly this is acknowledging that the strong-woman ideal championed by some quarters of the #MeToo movement comes at the expense of a more realistic and collaborative feminism. Natasha Kermani’s film is an elliptical but vehement statement on the post-#MeToo landscape. If the film’s story development is stymied by the narrative’s ultimate stasis, it is to all the better point out that the fight is far from finished.</p> <p>• Released on 4 March on Shudder.",False,pillar/arts,Arts,"['gender-based violence', 'domestic violence']"

Of those 177, 62.1% were identified as Black, Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander, or Native American, and 30.5% were born outside the United States.

politics/2021/feb/25/key-questions-alex-salmond-could-face-from-msps,article,politics,Politics,2021-02-25T18:30:23Z,Key questions Alex Salmond could face from MSPs,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/feb/25/key-questions-alex-salmond-could-face-from-msps,https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2021/feb/25/key-questions-alex-salmond-could-face-from-msps,"Alex Salmond, Scotland’s former first minister, is due to give evidence under oath on Friday to a committee of Holyrood MSPs investigating the Scottish government’s botched inquiry into complaints made by two female civil servants against him. His evidence session could last all afternoon. Here are some of the questions he could face.</p> <p><strong>Does he acknowledge he behaved inappropriately towards women – and that complainers found his conduct offensive or unacceptable?</strong></p> <p>Nicola Sturgeon has accused Salmond, her former mentor and boss, of making <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/feb/24/salmond-has-questions-to-answer-about-past-conduct-says-sturgeon"">“wild, baseless”</a> claims that there is a conspiracy against him. She says this is to deflect attention from allegations about his behaviour towards women – a reference to the inquiries that have taken place in the last three years.</p> <p>Two female civil servants accused him of sexual harassment during an internal Scottish government inquiry in 2018. That inquiry was later found by a court to be unlawful on procedural grounds.</p> <p>In 2019 he was prosecuted for 14 offences of sexual assault – including one of attempted rape – against 10 women, some of whom were junior civil servants. After one charge was dropped early on in the trial, in March 2020 the jury acquitted him of all 13 remaining offences.</p> <p><strong>What happened at Edinburgh airport?</strong></p> <p>Salmond, the Scottish government and the SNP were approached by <a href=""https://news.sky.com/story/female-airport-staff-complained-of-salmond-inappropriateness-says-ex-snp-deputy-leader-12157609"">Sky News in late 2017</a> about alleged incidents involving Salmond at Edinburgh airport between 2007 and 2009, when he was first minister and regularly flying to London.</p> <p>Angus Robertson, a former leader of the SNP in Westminster, confirmed in a statement to the Holyrood committee investigating the botched government inquiry that he “was called by an Edinburgh airport manager about Alex Salmond’s perceived ‘inappropriateness’ towards female staff at the airport.”</p> <p>Sturgeon admitted last year she had been told about the approaches by Sky News in November 2017. This conflicted with her previous statements to parliament and the media that she first knew of misconduct allegations against Salmond when he told her on 2 April 2018. </p> <p><strong>Where is the proof of a conspiracy?</strong></p> <p>Salmond accuses the Scottish National party, the Scottish government, its most senior civil servant, Leslie Evans, and even officials in the Crown Office of a “prolonged, malicious” conspiracy against him.</p> <p>Sturgeon has challenged him to present proof of this rather than relying on circumstantial evidence</p> <p>Salmond also alleges that his former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein was given the identity of one of the two junior civil servants who had accused him of sexual harassment before Salmond and Sturgeon met at her home on 2 April 2018.</p> <p>On Thursday <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/feb/25/nicola-sturgeon-challenged-alleged-naming-alex-salmond-complainer"">Sturgeon was asked by MSPs</a> if she could give categoric assurances that the “name of a complainer was not passed” to Aberdein. Sturgeon answered: “To the very best of my knowledge, I do not think that happened.” Can Salmond prove it happened? Does he have any witnesses or corroboration?</p> <p><strong>Why did he keep on pressing Sturgeon to intervene?</strong></p> <p>Salmond had five conversations with Sturgeon during 2018, including one at her home in April 2018 where he lobbied her to intervene in the Scottish government inquiry into two complaints by female officials of sexual harassment.</p> <p>Sturgeon insists she told him she could not and would not intervene. Is that true? What did Sturgeon say to him during those meetings? Why did he insist on discussing it with her on five occasions over the summer of 2018 if it was true she did not intervene?",False,pillar/news,News,"['rape', 'sexual assault']"
