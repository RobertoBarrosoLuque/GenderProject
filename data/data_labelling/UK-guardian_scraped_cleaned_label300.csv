Women On Web, an online community based in the Netherlands, received 45 pill requests in March and 47 in April, up from 18 in February, with three women who requested abortion pills saying they had been raped by their partner during lockdown.</p> <p>Abortion Support Network, a UK-based charity, recorded an increase in requests from an average of seven a month before the pandemic to 13 each in March and April and 19 in May.</p> <p>Malta is the only country in Europe that bans abortion in all circumstances, even in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother’s life is at risk. Abortion is punishable with up to three years in prison.</p> <p>It is estimated that between 300 and 400 women from Malta travel abroad for an abortion each year, with the UK often their country of choice. In 2019, 58 women from Malta travelled to the UK for an abortion, up from 45 the previous year.</p> <p>But with flights restricted and quarantine rules in place, women have been unable to leave the country and some have taken illegal abortion pills at home in lockdown.</p> <p>Doctors from Mater Dei, the only NHS hospital in Malta, have seen a surge in the number of women turning up in A&amp;E suffering from incomplete miscarriages, from what they suspect are self-induced abortions using pills illegally bought online. They have also witnessed women forced to deliver abnormal foetuses that they wish to terminate, including a baby with severe brain defects.</p> <p>Prof Isabel Stabile, who runs a private gynaecological practice on the island, said she was deeply concerned by the increasing number of women falling victim to what she called the country’s “draconian abortion laws” during the pandemic. She is the only outspoken pro-choice gynaecologist in the country, so many women feel comfortable reaching out to her.</p> <p>“The women I’ve spoken to have felt trapped. I was able to help one woman with a severe foetal abnormality reach the UK but many have not been able to and have had to continue with their unwanted pregnancy,” she said.</p> <p>Maria Debono (not her real name), 31, was rushed to Mater Dei hospital in May after she felt faint with loss of blood after taking medical abortion pills at home alone at seven weeks of pregnancy. “I just felt so scared and alone. I was losing so much blood and didn’t want to go to hospital but my friend persuaded me to go,” she said.</p> <p>When she arrived at A&amp;E, doctors were so concerned that they told her they may need to operate. Debono feared the repercussions, so she lied to the doctors and said she had not taken anything. After some tests, the doctors told her she had “retained products of conception” left inside her womb and recorded it as an incomplete miscarriage.</p> <p>“I’m completely traumatised by what happened, that I put my life in danger and I could be labelled as a criminal,” Debono said.</p> <p>She believes the pill dosage she bought online was too weak and did not expel the foetus properly. However, the bleeding stopped and she was able to return home.</p> <p>A gynaecologist from Mater Dei hospital who does not wish to be named said: “What’s most dangerous is that women can’t trust the healthcare provider to discuss these things. If someone is bleeding heavily, we need to know what caused it so we can treat them properly. Most of the time taking the tablets is safe but there are risks.”</p> <p>Stabile said: “I firmly believe that the lack of abortion services on the island means that our medical authorities are falling short of the highest evidence-based standards recommended by international guidelines.”",False,pillar/news,News,['forced abortion']

He pioneered much of what now constitutes modern routine preventive care, seeking out those most in need. His research from the 1960s onwards in Welsh mining communities showed that medical care was often not available to those with greatest need: the most deprived in society. Today we are seeing a corollary to this with the imposition of restrictive Covid-19 lockdown measures that target the most deprived – those who can least afford to endure them. The government has <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53926977"">now announced</a> trial payments for some people on low incomes who must self-isolate, but more is required.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>The watchlist figure ignores the impact of the disease. Many who test positive will have a low risk of transmission</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the week ending 8 August, there were 110 positive cases of Sars-CoV-2 per 100,000 in the town of Oldham – breaking through the 50 cases threshold that puts it on the government’s “red alert” watchlist.</p> <p>Each week Public Health England (PHE) <a href=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/911002/Weekly_COVID19_Surveillance_Report_week_34_FINAL.pdf"">publishes a Covid-19 report</a> that summarises information from the surveillance systems used to monitor the pandemic in England. Currently, 28 local authorities are on the at-risk watchlist following the weekly Local Action Committee meeting. In 18 of them, households are not allowed to mix. While weekly rates in Oldham have come down, they are still among the highest.</p> <p>The current watchlist is dominated by areas of deprivation: Bradford (ranked the 13th most deprived local authority in England), Blackburn with Darwen, Hyndburn, Oldham and Leicester are at the top of the watchlist. They are all in the top 10% of the most deprived areas in England.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/25/england-second-wave-coronavirus-winter-surge"">Has England learned any lessons from the first wave of coronavirus? | Philip Ball</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The higher number of detected cases in these deprived areas is highly predictable. A built environment provides numerous opportunities for transmission of infection: high population density and overcrowded housing present the ideal conditions. In England, about <a href=""https://www.jrf.org.uk/data/non-decent-housing-and-overcrowding#:~:text=In%20England%2C%20about%203%25%20of,those%20in%20the%20middle%20fifth."">3% of the population</a> live in overcrowded accommodation; this is much more prevalent among lower-income households. And while 2% of white households experienced overcrowding from 2014 to 2017, that number is much higher in ethnic minorities – it shoots up to 30% in <a href=""https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/housing/housing-conditions/overcrowded-households/latest"">Bangladeshi households</a>.</p> <p>Oldham town has a greater proportion of minority-ethnic residents than Greater Manchester or England: one in 10 of the population is of Pakistani heritage, one in 14 of Bangladeshi heritage. These communities primarily live in the most deprived areas and have already been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. The death rate among people of Bangladeshi heritage is <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m2282#:~:text=Death%20rates%20in%20people%20known,compared%20with%20white%20British%20people."">twice that</a> of white people even when accounting for age, sex, and levels of deprivation. The risk for other ethnic minorities is 10-50% higher than for white people.</p> <p>PHE’s <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m2264.full"">review in June</a> promised to discover why the infection had such an unequal effect on people of different ethnicity. However, the report has been widely criticised for <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m2264.full"">mentioning nothing</a> about what could be done to improve the situation or suggesting plans for protecting at-risk groups.</p> <p>Are the restrictive measures, therefore, justified? The current watchlist level is based on an arbitrary figure that does not represent how we have assessed epidemic levels of community infection in the past.</p> <p>An epidemic is said to occur when weekly GP consultations for new episodes of flu-like illness exceed 400 per 100,000. This figure, therefore, refers to a person who has symptoms and is presenting to healthcare. On the contrary, current PCR testing is being used as a screening tool: in affected areas, testing is on the increase due to hypervigilance and active case-finding strategies that include knocking on doors. This strategy frequently picks up asymptomatic people.</p> <p>The watchlist figure of 50 per 100,000, therefore, does not consider the impact of the disease. Only nine people are currently in hospital with Covid-19 across the Pennine Trust hospitals that cover Oldham, Rochdale (also on the watchlist) and North Manchester. Increased testing leads to more detection of the virus, but it has not necessarily translated into infections that cause symptomatic disease. Many of those who have tested positive would be classed as weak positives – their risk of transmitting the disease further is low.</p> <p>Politicians’ urge to intervene is a sign that the test-and-trace programme has failed. But restrictive interventions are often too quickly deployed. Nevertheless, there is a radical need to improve living conditions; improve access to health and social services; address the urban environmental exposures that contribute to infectious outbreaks; and rethink the social factors that cause high infection rates in deprived areas.</p> <p>Tudor Hart died in 2018. He is best known for his “inverse care law” that showed the availability of good medical care tends to correspond inversely with the need for it in the population served. The case for improving health outcomes in deprived populations is clear. But there is a pressing need for our politicians to think carefully before deciding what to do next and consider the wider needs of the people affected by such restrictive measures.</p> <ul> <li><p>Carl Heneghan is director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford</p></li> </ul",False,pillar/opinion,Opinion,['gender-based violence']

Since last week since when Sarah first went missing, six women and a little girl have been have been reported as being killed at the hands of men.</p> \n<p>“So it’s not particularly rare and the fear that women live with is an everyday thing. For most women they have had some form of experience that they feel frightened of and the message that they should be sending out is not one about what women should or shouldn’t do.</p> \n<p>“It is about how serious violence against women and girls is and how it is an epidemic that we have to put far more attention and resource into.”</p> \n<p>On Wednesday night, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, announced that police had discovered human remains in woodland in Kent during the search for Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive. The remains have not yet been identified. A serving police officer has been arrested on suspicion of Everard’s murder.</p> \n<p>Seeking to reassure the public, the Met commissioner said: “I know Londoners will want to know that it is thankfully incredibly rare for a woman to be abducted from our streets. I completely understand that despite this, women in London and the wider public – particularly those in the area where Sarah went missing – will be worried and may well be feeling scared.”</p> \n<p>PC Wayne Couzens, 48, was arrested on Tuesday at his home in Deal, Kent, on suspicion of kidnapping Everard, who vanished after leaving a friend’s house at around 9pm on 3 March and beginning a 50-minute walk home.</p> \n<p>Mandu Reid, the leader of the British Women’s Equality party, has said the Met should not oversee the case, given the arrest of a serving officer.</p> \n<p>She said: “This case has affected women right across the capital and across the country but I cannot begin to imagine the pain that Sarah’s friends and family are going through.</p> \n<p>“The fact that a police officer has been arrested on suspicion of murder makes it all the more frightening, and it is imperative that the case is now taken over by a separate police force. We have to do this right.”</p> \n<p>London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: “I know how shocked and worried Londoners are by Sarah’s disappearance and the developments in the case.</p> \n<p>“I want to assure Sarah’s family, and everyone in our city, that the police are doing absolutely everything they can … Londoners will continue to see more police officers on our streets continuing their investigation and carrying out reassurance patrols in the area where Sarah went missing a week ago.”</p> \n<p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, called the case “devastating” and added: “Women should be able to walk home without fear or threat.”</p> \n<p>The case has prompted many women to share experiences of being threatened or harassed by men as they walked home. Phillips said she was a “tough cookie” but said that “when I was a teenager a man pulled up next to me and exposed himself to me”.</p> \n<p>“It’s got absolutely nothing to do with anything I can do. I can’t change the chromosomes in my body … I’m not stereotyping women as weak, I’m not even stereotyping men as all being perpetrators.</p> \n<p>“I am saying that the message that needs to be sent, is that male violence is something that has to be tackled and challenged – and the justice system and society has to wake up to that, because at the moment we just simply don’t take it as seriously as we take other crimes.”",False,pillar/news,News,"['gender-based violence', 'women killed over honor', 'domestic violence']"

A return to imagined halcyon days of an Obama presidency or to “normalcy”– which for Indigenous peoples in the United States is everyday colonialism – isn’t justice, nor is it the radical departure from the status quo we need to bolster Indigenous rights and combat the climate crisis.</p> <p>Obama’s record is mixed. While opposing the northern leg of Keystone XL in 2015, Obama had already fast-tracked the construction of the pipeline’s southern leg in 2012, despite massive opposition from Indigenous and environmental groups.</p> <p>His “all-of-the-above energy strategy” committed to curbing emissions while also promoting US “energy independence” by embracing domestic oil production. Thanks to this policy, the lifting of a four-decade limit on exporting crude oil from the United States, and the fracking revolution, US domestic crude oil production increased by 88% from 2008 to 2016.</p> <p>Domestic oil pipeline construction also increased – and so, too, did resistance to it. During the protests against the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, Obama’s FBI infiltrated the Standing Rock camps. “There’s an obligation for protesters to be peaceful,” he admonished the unarmed Water Protectors at the prayer camps who faced down water cannons in freezing weather, attack dogs, mass arrests and the ritualistic brutality of a heavily militarized small army of police.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""0a9a9369b8920c8768de3862a294413b6f1fd986""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/0a9a9369b8920c8768de3862a294413b6f1fd986/0_224_3466_2079/1000.jpg"" alt=""Women hold a prayer ceremony on Backwater Bridge during a protest against the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, North Dakota, November 2016."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Women hold a prayer ceremony on Backwater Bridge during a protest against the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, North Dakota, in November 2016.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Stephanie Keith/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2018, Obama claimed credit for the United States becoming the world’s largest oil producer, <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/5dfbc1aa17701ae219239caad0bfefb2"">urging</a> industry elites in Texas to “thank” him for making them rich. Trump’s subsequent, and more aggressive, policy of “unleashing American energy dominance” built on Obama’s gains.</p> <p>Undoing four years of Trump – and the lasting damage it brought – can’t be the only barometer of climate justice. Nor should we lower our expectations of what is possible and necessary for Native sovereignty and treaty rights.</p> <p>Biden partly owes his election victory to Native voters. Arizona voting districts with large Native populations helped flipped the traditionally Republican state last November to his and Democrats’ favor.</p> <p>Native aspirations, however, don’t entirely align with Biden’s climate agenda, the Democratic party, or electoral politics.</p> <p>In Arizona, where Biden won the Native vote, the Forest Service could, in the coming months, hand over 2,400 acres of Chi’chil Bildagoteel, an Apache sacred site, to the Australian mining company Rio Tinto. In 2014, the Arizona Republican senator John McCain attached a rider to a defense authorization bill to allow the transfer of land to make way for a copper mine, which would create a nearly two-mile wide open-pit crater destroying numerous Native burial sites, ceremonial areas and cultural items in the process. (Last year, Rio Tinto blew up Juukan Gorge Cave, a 46,000-year-old Indigenous sacred site, to expand an iron ore mine in Australia.)</p> <p>A Democratic Senate passed <a href=""https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2020/12/11/resolution-copper-may-fast-track-trumps-final-days/5981085002/"">Resolution Copper</a>; Obama signed it into law; and Trump fast-tracked the environmental review during his last days in office. Resource colonialism is a bipartisan affair.</p> <p>Much like the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s dilemma with the Dakota Access pipeline, the Apache Stronghold, made up of members of the San Carlos Apache Tribe opposing the copper mine at Oak Flat, has little recourse. No law exists giving Native people control of their lands outside government-defined reservation boundaries.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>We must ask ourselves why Biden and his supporters can imagine a carbon-free future but not the end of US colonialism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rio Tinto’s copper mine aims to meet at least a quarter of the United States’ annual copper needs, an essential metal that will be in high demand for renewable energy and electric vehicles. According to <a href=""http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/961711588875536384/Minerals-for-Climate-Action-The-Mineral-Intensity-of-the-Clean-Energy-Transition.pdf"">the World Bank</a>, three billions tons of metals and minerals like copper and lithium will be required by 2050 for wind, solar and geothermal power to meet the base target of the Paris agreement, which Biden has committed the US to rejoining.</p> <p>And before Trump left office, the Bureau of Land Management issued a <a href=""https://ktla.com/news/nationworld/bidens-energy-plan-may-receive-boost-from-lithium-mine-okd-in-donald-trumps-last-days-as-president/"">final permit</a> to the Canadian mining company Lithium Americas to create an open-pit lithium mine at Thacker Pass on traditional Paiute land in Nevada. The mine could bolster Biden’s $2tn “green energy” transition plan. Lithium is a key ingredient of rechargeable batteries, and it’s what attracted Elon Musk’s Tesla battery factory to Nevada. Last October, Biden reportedly <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-mining/exclusive-biden-campaign-tells-miners-it-supports-domestic-production-of-ev-metals-idINKBN27808B"">told</a> a group of miners that he planned to increase domestic lithium production to wean the country from foreign sources like China.</p> <p>These “green” techno fixes and consumer-based solutions might provide short-term answers, but they don’t stop the plunder of Native lands. Even the addition of Deb Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo, to the Biden cabinet won’t fundamentally change the colonial nature of the United States. We must ask ourselves why Biden and his supporters can imagine a carbon-free future but not the end of US colonialism.</p> <p>But no matter who is US president, Indigenous people will continue fighting for the land and the future of the planet.

Foster confirmed to the inquest that Khan “appeared to show remorse for what he’d done”. He added: “He had conversations with me about wanting to change and make a fresh start – to pay more attention to the ripple effect of his actions.”</p> <p>Nick Armstrong, QC, counsel for Merritt’s family, pointed out to Foster that in April 2018, there was a 64-page report into Khan, which “concluded that he had not reduced his risk”.</p> <p>Foster said: “I’m quite open to say that it is possible for me to have been conned.”</p> <p>Amy Ludlow, co-founder of Learning Together, the organisation hosting the event at the hall, confirmed she was aware Khan had been regarded as high-risk category A prisoner before she invited him to attend the event.</p> <p>She told the inquest: “People used to call him ‘High Risk Khan’. He didn’t hide the fact of his conviction or his high-risk status.”</p> <p>The inquest was told that there were only 70 of prisoners in the country, or 0.1% judged this dangerous.</p> <p>Ludlow said the probation service had given permission for Khan to attend the event. She said: “I was content that Usman Khan had permission to attend without any restrictions and without any warning given to me.”</p> <p>She also defended Khan’s invitation to Fishmongers’ Hall and the support Learning had provided him in trying to find a job. She said: “It is about the cultivation of hope and possibility. We know from research that that’s really important to supporting processes of moving away from crime.”</p> <p>Ludlow confirmed that Khan attended a previous Learning Together event in 2019 accompanied by two police officers. She said she assumed restrictions had been eased by the time of the attack because of the “very rosy” assessments of Khan by the probation service.</p> <p>The inquest was told that before his release Khan wrote an essay about radicalisation in modern Europe after attending a creative writing course in prison run by Learning Together.</p> <p>Hough said: “Parts of this essay might appear to be an explanation or even a justification for radicalism.”</p> <p>Ludlow said: “I don’t have that concern. I think there is some balance and some commitment to the prevention of those things.”</p> <p>Hough asked: “Would you have been concerned to be told that Usman Khan had a history in the prison intelligence linking him to violent incidents, bullying, serious disruption, and radicalism, including forced conversions?”</p> <p>Ludlow replied: “I trusted it was fed into the risk assessment processes.”</p> <p>The inquests, at the Guildhall in the City of London, continue.",False,pillar/news,News,['sexual assault']

Republicans have been eager to fight aggressively to prevent Rice from making it through the confirmation process and were expected to recall her involvement in the 2012 Benghazi attack in Libya as part of their strategy.</p> <p>The domestic policy council position does not require Senate confirmation.</p> <p>Biden also nominated Denis McDonough, former chief of staff to President Obama, to run the Department of Veterans Affairs, a sprawling agency that has presented organizational challenges for both parties over the years. But he never served in the armed forces, a fact noted by a leading veterans organization.</p> <p>In selecting Rice and McDonough, Biden is continuing to fill his administration with prominent members of the Obama administration. He will make the formal announcements on Friday, along with his nominations of the Ohio representative Marcia Fudge to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Katherine Tai as US trade representative and Tom Vilsack as agriculture secretary. Vilsack filled that same role during Obama’s two terms.</p> <p>“The roles they will take on are where the rubber meets the road – where competent and crisis-tested governance can make a meaningful difference in people’s lives, enhancing the dignity, equity, security, and prosperity of the day-to-day lives of Americans,” Biden said in a statement.</p> <p>In choosing Rice to oversee the White House council, advisers said Biden was signaling the importance of domestic policy in his early agenda. Though the council was created with the intention of being on par with the White House national security council, it traditionally has had a lower public profile, including for its directors.</p> <p>Rice is expected to be more of a force, inside and outside the White House, and her appointment creates a new power center in the West Wing. She has discussed replicating some elements of the national security council in her new role, including a principals committee of cabinet secretaries and others that could bring more structure to domestic policymaking, but also pull more power into the West Wing.</p> <p>She is expected to play an active role in the Biden administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Healthcare, immigration and tackling racial inequality are also expected to be among the top issues for the domestic policy shop next year.</p> <p>The 56-year-old Rice will be among the most prominent Black women in Biden’s administration.</p> <p>Although Biden has insisted his administration will not simply be a retread of Obama’s presidency, he is bringing back numerous familiar faces. His team has defended the moves as a nod toward experience and the need to hit the ground running in tackling the pressing issues facing the nation across multiple fronts.</p> <p>Shirley Anne Warshaw, a professor at Gettysburg College who has studied the presidency and cabinets, said following Obama as he builds out his team gives Biden an advantage.</p> <p>“This is a much better bench than Obama had because these people have the experience of serving in the Obama administration,” Warshaw said. “In that way, Joe Biden is the luckiest man in the world.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""4530ab50a73aab0186940e3fe854f98944493212""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/4530ab50a73aab0186940e3fe854f98944493212/0_57_5184_3110/1000.jpg"" alt=""Denis McDonough, nominated as veterans affairs secretary, was Barack Obama’s chief of staff in his second term."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Denis McDonough, nominated as veterans affairs secretary, was Barack Obama’s chief of staff in his second term.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Zach Gibson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McDonough, the VA nominee, is an experienced manager who was chief of staff throughout Obama’s second term.

The independence of the judiciary, the success of the BBC, the impartiality of the civil service and the authority of parliament - all have been bricked and bottled by the blue anarchists. When the Tory leader tried his prorogation stunt <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue"">last autumn</a>, he was even prepared to taint the position of the Queen by giving her illegal advice. Now their delinquency has escalated to explicitly tearing up the rule of law. That foundation stone of British democracy and lodestar of our country’s international reputation, the principle that once had no more passionate champion than the Conservative party, is no longer safe from them.</p> <p>It was an extraordinary moment when a member of the cabinet stood before parliament to declare that the government plans to intentionally <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/08/government-admits-new-brexit-bill-will-break-international-law"">break international law</a> by unilaterally rewriting sections of the withdrawal agreement with the EU. Number 10 then confirmed that Mr Johnson was ready to violate a treaty that he negotiated less than a year ago, made the centrepiece of his pitch to the British people at the election last December, and then had the Commons rapidly ratify in January. The agreement he once flourished as a “wonderful” triumph for his personal diplomacy is now described by Number 10 as a rushed botch that the prime minister never liked. Breaching of a treaty that he himself signed and advocated sets a fresh standard of brazenness.</p> <p>The anger of European leaders has not surprised Number 10. Some there, those who think spitting in someone’s face is an effective form of diplomacy, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/11/brexit-uk-negotiators-believe-brinkmanship-reboot-trade-talks"">report</a> that it was a deliberately incendiary act. </p> <p>A regime with an unveiled contempt for both officials and conventions probably shrugged at the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/08/uks-top-legal-civil-servant-quits-over-brexit-deal-changes-jonathan-jones"">resignation</a> of Sir Jonathan Jones as the head of the government’s legal department. Nor do they seem bothered that they have hideously compromised the offices of the attorney general and the lord chancellor who have both sworn solemn oaths to uphold the law. Theresa May and Sir John Major are among the senior Tories shocked to find that an allegedly Conservative government wants to turn Britain into a treaty-breaking renegade state. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/09/brexit-bill-northern-ireland-criticised-as-obvious-breach-of-international-law"">Sir John warns</a>: “If we lose our reputation for honouring the promises we make, we will have lost something without price.” Grave reprimands from two of his predecessors would have troubled previous prime ministers, but not this one. My word is my bond is not a motto by which Boris Johnson has ever lived his life.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Even the zealots at Number 10 may have a tremor of self-doubt when they are losing Tory elders as Brexity as Lord Howard</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What may disturb him, at least a bit, is the vehemence of the reaction from some on the right of his party. No one has excoriated him as fiercely as Michael Howard, a veteran Eurosceptic. That former Tory leader makes the excellent point that the “severe damage” done to Britain’s moral authority will make it harder to criticise international law-breaking by the likes of China, Russia and Iran. Norman Lamont, the former Tory chancellor and one of the first prophets of Brexit, weighed in to say that the government had got itself into a “terrible mess”. Even the zealots at Number 10 may have a tremor of self-doubt when they are losing Tory elders as Brexity as Lords Howard and Lamont.</p> <p>The trigger for this simultaneous descent towards rogue nation status and lurch to the brink of a crash-out Brexit was the deadlock in the talks with the EU. It is no surprise that they have proved much more difficult than the Brexiters sought to pretend during the referendum campaign, when the negotiation was going be a “piece of cake”, and again in the run up to the December election, when Mr Johnson promised that his “oven-ready deal” would secure “a fantastic new trade agreement with the EU”. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/24/there-is-no-more-deceptive-slogan-of-this-campaign-than-get-brexit-done"">As some of us remarked at the time</a>, “Get Brexit Done” was both the most effective slogan of the Tories’ election campaign and the most mendacious. </p> <p>What was harder to anticipate is that the negotiations have got into most serious difficulty over the issue of business subsidies. In return for continuing access to its single market, the EU wants the UK to comply with restrictions on <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/08/brexit-talks-why-the-wrangles-over-state-aid"">state aid</a> to prevent companies this side of the Channel gaining an unfair advantage. These competition rules flowed from the creation of the single market that was driven by Margaret Thatcher. If the Iron Lady were still with us, she would be melting in horror that a government that calls itself Conservative is fighting to the brink for the right to use market-distorting subsidies. And imagine her bewilderment at discovering that a French politician is leading the other side of the argument. The main reason this has become such a contentious issue is Dominic Cummings. Many excellent sources report that the prime minister’s chief adviser has an obsessive ambition to direct large amounts of government aid in support of tech ventures. Sensible Tories boggle that their government would trash Britain’s reputation as a trustworthy international partner, wreck our trade and security relations with our closest neighbours and risk the prospects of many existing British businesses so that Number 10’s self-appointed genius can fantasise that he is a cross between Elon Musk, Sergey Brin and Masayoshi Son while splashing taxpayers’ money at any “moonshot” idea that launches off the top of his head. This is a most surreal place for the Conservative party to have got to.</p> <p>A growing band of Tories can see this. Revulsion with international law-breaking has combined with the many discontents about the handling of the coronavirus crisis to add to the febrility among Conservative MPs. When I put in a call to one senior Tory, our conversation began with him asking: “Covid or Brexit? Which shitshow do you want to talk about?”</p> <p>Among those Tories who still believe that the rule of law matters, a rebellion is gathering weight. Even if the prime minister gets his way in the Commons, his scheme will be ripped apart in the Lords, where there are many peers who take issues of constitutionality very seriously. There is no sign of the EU flinching in the face of blustery Johnsonian brinkmanship with which they are now highly familiar. Rather, their unity has hardened around the threat of trade and financial sanctions if he doesn’t back down by the end of the month.</p> <p>It is characteristic of the tight and self-admiring bubble at Number 10 that they embarked down this dangerous road without considering how other powerful political forces might react. They particularly neglected to consider that the Irish American caucus in Washington would respond angrily to illegal meddling with the special protocols on Northern Ireland. On both sides of the aisle, <a href=""https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/992"">congressmen and women</a> are lambasting the Johnson government’s latest manoeuvre as a risk to the Good Friday agreement. If they are hostile to Britain, there is <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/08/brexit-northern-ireland-us-uk-trade-deal"">no prospect of securing a trade agreement</a> with the US, which the Brexiters have always held out as one of the great prizes of their enterprise. </p> <p>There are plenty of skilled diplomats and civil servants working for the British government with the connections and expertise to have spotted how badly this reckless gambit would backfire, but the behaviour of Number 10 deters them from offering candid advice. As one senior Tory puts it: “The climate of fear in Whitehall that they (Johnson and Cummings) have created means that officials do not rush to warn them when they are about to make a mistake.”</p> <p>Continuing down this road will also increase the threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom and make it that much more conceivable that history records Boris Johnson as the prime minister who lost Scotland. The Nationalists have already prospered mightily from Scottish resentment that they are being forced into a Brexit the majority of them opposed by a Tory government that an even larger majority didn’t want. A disaster Brexit occurring in the months immediately leading up to next spring’s election to the Holyrood parliament will be all their Hogmanays at once for the SNP. That would surely guarantee them a thumping victory that they would then exploit to claim an irresistible mandate for another referendum on independence. In the words of a Conservative who once held a very senior position in the cabinet: “A no-deal Brexit will put rocket-boosters under Nicola Sturgeon. What is a Tory government doing putting the United Kingdom at so much risk?”</p> <p>What indeed? Perhaps that senior Tory asks the wrong question about a government that vandalises so many of the principles and institutions that Conservatives once cherished. Of a regime that violates international law and jeopardises the union, Tories should really be asking themselves: is this a Conservative government at all?</p> <p>• Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",False,pillar/opinion,Opinion,['gang-rape']

world/2021/feb/15/the-women-starting-businesses-in-lockdown-the-upside,article,world,World news,2021-02-15T09:00:06Z,‘We were made for this’: female entrepreneurs ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/15/the-women-starting-businesses-in-lockdown-the-upside,https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/feb/15/the-women-starting-businesses-in-lockdown-the-upside,"It may not appear the most auspicious time to start a business. Britain has been in lockdown for five of the past 11 months. The economy shrank almost 10% last year. Unemployment is skyrocketing.</p> <p>But Lucie Halley-Trotter is undeterred. This year she launched her first company, an ethical, sustainable fashion brand, <a href=""https://www.eyoactive.com/"">EYO</a>, that takes recycled ocean and landfill waste and remakes it into sportswear.</p> <p>“I’ve had a lot of stern warnings from people saying ‘are you sure it’s a good idea to start right now?’,” Halley-Trotter muses, “but so many good businesses have started in hard times.”</p> <p>The entrepreneur knows something about overcoming adversity, having sustained life-changing injuries in an accident in New York a few years ago. The deepest recession for 300 years doesn’t seem to faze her, and instead she sees opportunities in the way the pandemic has changed attitudes in Britain.</p> <p>“I actually see it as an advantage. It’s activewear, and people are turning to this, turning their homes and gardens into gyms and looking to buy from businesses that are more local and ethical,” she says.</p> <p>Remarkably, Halley-Trotter is far from alone. In the course of researching this article, the Guardian heard from dozens of new entrepreneurs who had started businesses in lockdown. A large preponderance were women.</p> <p>When crisis strikes, women commonly experience greater setbacks than men, as they earn less, hold more insecure jobs and make up the majority of single-parent households.</p> <p>This pandemic is no exception. At least 2.6 million people will be unemployed by the middle of this year in the UK – 7.5% of the working-age population. But it is mothers who are <a href=""http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-8898/CBP-8898.pdf"">1.5 times more likely</a> than fathers to have lost their job or quit since the start of the lockdown.</p> <p>And globally women are a third more likely than men to work in a sector or industry shut down by coronavirus. More than <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/30/gender-equality-covid-19-jobs-ilo"">half a billion women</a>, or 40% of all employed women, work in the most affected sectors.</p> <p>Perhaps because of this insecurity, women appear to be at the forefront of a nascent spirit of entrepreneurship. “The cards may have been stacked against women but out of the doom and desperation we are seeing some extraordinary examples of strength and resilience with some small pockets of hope and inspiration emerging,” said Stuart Lewis, the founder of <a href=""https://restless.co.uk/"">Rest Less</a>, an online jobs site.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""549a7391e016e4a8984c0a5ddf4178bce506ca29""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/549a7391e016e4a8984c0a5ddf4178bce506ca29/0_43_3024_3780/800.jpg"" alt=""Joely To."" width=""800"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Joely To.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Joely To is certainly at the younger end of the entrepreneurial spectrum. With extra time on her hands during lockdown, the A-level student set up <a href=""https://joely-to.wixsite.com/pioneer"">Pioneer</a>, a non-profit enterprise aiming to nurture a passion for maths in girls aged 11 to 18.</p> <p>During the long, hot lockdown summer, To partnered with <a href=""https://girlsindata.co.uk/"">Girls in Data</a> to hold three data challenge series and a summer school for more than 600 girls across the UK. She built up a team of 14 Pioneer outreach officers who worked with companies including Experian, Zurich Insurance, Tableau and Chartmetric to create challenges that required girls to apply their problem-solving skills to real-world business problems in maths-related careers.</p> <p>“One 16-year-old got an early job offer from Experian after completing our challenge,” she said.</p> <p>Technology not surprisingly features as a central idea in a lot of new businesses. Rachel ab Iorwerth also saw a pandemic niche and went for it, setting up Zoom and Teams hosting services for free before demand became such that – while still working as a school librarian – she set up her company <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/hozts.co.uk/?hl=en-gb"">HoZts</a>.</p> <p>“I’d had the idea as soon as lockdown hit in March and it really took off,” she said. “By Christmas, office parties on Zoom took off so we went from the odd exercise class and comedy night to twice daily events and tag teaming to cover them all.”</p> <p>“We’ve still got our day jobs – for now – but our past lives have included television and festivals, so we have the perfect tone to develop a rapport with corporations and performers,” she added. “We were made for this.”</p> <p>Tracey Barnes rapidly moved online with her <a href=""http://www.dancingforhealth.co.uk/"">dancing lessons for people with health issues </a>during lockdown, and has found she is able to tap a wider market as a result. “My target audience suddenly widened to anyone across the UK who fancied a bit of seated dance,” she said. “I’m holding multiple classes a day and they’re all full. We all log in half an hour early just to have a chat!”</p> <p>For some women, the pandemic has led to them changing their career direction altogether. Julia Kirby-Smith worked as a broadcast journalist until she was headhunted – and then made redundant four months later.</p> <p>“We were in the middle of a pandemic but I’m optimistic, single-minded and perhaps a bit naive so thought, what the hell, I’ll go for a huge career change,” she said. She set up a sustainable grocery business called <a href=""https://fridgeofplenty.com/"">Fridge of Plenty </a>in north London.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""793f9264b64cfe27c7f36d261b5602d6d8e14fe4""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/793f9264b64cfe27c7f36d261b5602d6d8e14fe4/126_0_3780_2268/1000.jpg"" alt=""Julia Kirby-Smith"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Julia Kirby-Smith: ‘We’ve had to be really innovative about the logistics around our home deliveries.’</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead of seeing the lockdown as a problem, Kirby-Smith saw it as an opportunity. “I think we were lucky to open when the rest of the high street was closed down,” she said. “We’ve had to be really innovative about the logistics around our home deliveries, which has been a great – if intense – education for us.</p> <p>“Also, we’ve made a point of stopping to have a proper conversation with everyone we deliver food to,” she added. “We realised we were the only people a lot of them were talking to from one week to the next. It’s nice to be able to help alleviate their loneliness, but also it’s a great way to create customer loyalty and recognition in a very intense and sped-up way. Without the pandemic, this sort of customer connection could have taken us years to build up.”</p> <p>And it’s not just in the UK that women are creating business opportunities for themselves during the pandemic. Chicca Malone, from Tuscany, lives with her family in Italy’s famous Bolgheri wine region, in a farmhouse located on the Wine Road.</p> <p>“I have a cooking school that worked very well for over 20 years until the pandemic hit. Most of my guests are from the US and all my classes and tours were cancelled.

Instead, with the help of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/bolivia-evo-morales-vow-jail-rest-life-arturo-murillo"">her hardline interior minister Arturo Murillo</a>, the conservative Christian set about <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/11/bolivia-justice-system-evo-morales-allies-human-rights-watch-report"">pursuing Morales supporters</a> and alienating Bolivia’s indigenous majority with a display of <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/bolivia-faces-power-vacuum-and-more-chaos-after-morales-quits"">Bible bashing</a> and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/bolivia-el-alto-violence-death-protest"">brute force</a>.</p> <p>“They showed so much vindictiveness against the Mas and the impact [on indigenous voters] was dramatic because a lot of people basically said: ‘Look, these guys are not only going to go after Evo, they’re going to go after everybody who looks like Evo,’” said Eduardo Gamarra, a Bolivia expert at Florida International University.</p> <p>Derpic said Áñez’s decision <a href=""https://cn.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idUSKBN1ZO026"">to herself run for president</a> – only abandoning her bid on the eve of the election – caused further alarm. Some feared the right would lead Bolivia back into dictatorship and used Sunday’s vote to say no. “There was part of Bolivian society who, despite the disappointment and anger and frustration with the Mas, wanted to preserve democracy,” Derpic said.</p> <p>But Mas’s resurrection also speaks to its own strengths: its powerful connection to Bolivia’s indigenous populations and working classes, and how it savvily reinvented itself to win back voters disillusioned with Morales’s refusal to relinquish power.</p> <p>“They ran an intelligent campaign … and probably the most important thing was that they separated themselves from Evo,” said Gamarra.</p> <p>With Morales exiled to Argentina after what supporters declared a coup, Arce pitched himself as an efficient and thoughtful leader who could bring social and economic stability to a divided nation facing a dire economic outlook and <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/22/world/americas/virus-bolivia.html"">one of the world’s worst Covid-19 crises</a>.</p> <p>“He’s softly-spoken.

Well, not literally.</p> <p>In the opening scene of 23-year-old British playwright Jasmine Lee-Jones’ rapid-fire debut<em>,</em> two grown women drag a body along the ground and heave it into the bright ether of a bedroom floor. It’s the start of a sharp-shooting interrogation of modern anti-Blackness and cultural appropriation, told through the lens of the socialite’s formidable presence over popular and online culture.</p> <p>Directed by Shari Sebbens, the award-winning play is in Australia for the first time, after debuting in London in 2019. The narrative begins on Twitter, after Forbes magazine claims Kylie Jenner as the “first self-made billionaire”. Cleo (Moreblessing Maturure), who is writing her university dissertation on structural racism, fires back with an anonymous thread under the hashtag #kyliejennerfidead, detailing – one by one – the hypothetical methods of killing Jenner (poison, drowning, disgrace etc).</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/mar/25/stop-girl-review-journalist-sally-saras-debut-play-crawls-into-the-dark-heart-of-trauma"">Stop Girl review – journalist Sally Sara\'s debut play crawls into the dark heart of trauma</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The scrolling tweets appear on screens above the stage, slickly presented by audiovisual designer Wendy Yu – which are then hilariously acted out in smartly timed sync by Maturure and Vivienne Awosoga, who plays Cleo’s best friend, Kara.</p> <p>Mostly, however, the thread becomes an outlet for Cleo to unleash her frustrations at society’s hypocrisies – in particular, the commodification of Black bodies for a rich, white woman’s celebration and benefit.</p> <p>The depiction of how millennials and Gen Z use social media is one of the play’s triumphs: particularly the dichotomy between amusing flairs such as emoji and GIFs versus the toxicity of instant, sometimes cruel replies. The Darlinghurst Theatre Company and Green Door Theatre Company production is rough around the edges, zappy in its dialogue, and youthfully provocative, with heavy-hitting subject matter that punches through.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""5f40b95fcdbaa8068c8ad24b92f166af849a984a""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/5f40b95fcdbaa8068c8ad24b92f166af849a984a/0_0_3284_2189/1000.jpg"" alt=""Moreblessing Maturure stars as Cleo."" width=""1000"" height=""667"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Moreblessing Maturure stars as Cleo, who turns to Twitter to unleash her frustrations at society’s hypocrisies.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Teniola Komolafe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seven Methods is very much a two-hander, and it’s a deliciously high-octane one. Offline, Cleo and Kara are holed up in Cleo’s bedroom, where they butt heads on how to best navigate the battlefield of online activism: Cleo is hot-headed and passionate, a bit of a loose cannon, while Kara takes more of a backseat approach.</p> <p>This triggers heated debates between them about light-skinned privilege and the ownership of Blackness, as well as queer identity – while opening up discussions around full body trauma and the degradation of Black bodies through history.</p> <p>What are the consequences of a societal complicity that continues to fetishise Black culture? Why, for example, are Kylie Jenner’s “full lips” considered fashionable, but on a Black woman they’ve been a constant feature of shame and stigma? Lee-Jones asks these questions at breakneck speed, as Sebbens draws nuance from Cleo and Kara’s explosive clashes – legitimising each of their experiences of colourism, while painting a fuller picture of their collective subjection to white supremacy.</p> <p>The offline and online situations cleverly weave in and out, with each piecemeal section of the play relishing in a new, darker method of executing the titular act – and sets off another personal conflict between the friends. It’s also a breathtakingly accurate reflection of the familiar cycle that follows any moment of virality: the praise, the backlash, the digging up of past tweets – and then the collective exhaustion of engaging with it all.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""f50e989074d0dfb9831c002111e3a24f45b7908b""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/f50e989074d0dfb9831c002111e3a24f45b7908b/0_0_3415_2277/1000.jpg"" alt=""Awosoga and Maturure as Kara and Cleo."" width=""1000"" height=""667"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">‘Pitch-perfect’: Vivienne Awosoga and Moreblessing Maturure as Kara and Cleo.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Teniola Komolafe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Production designer Keerthi Subramanyam’s raised platform set offers enough room for the versatility of the action, with lighting and colour design from Kate Baldwin that effectively differentiates between Twittersphere and real life. But as the drama of the social media fiasco escalates, it doesn’t feed as cleanly into Cleo and Kara’s arguments – and the burning intensity of their conversation doesn’t always sustain itself through the play’s one-act nature.

In a Tweet dated 20 June, which has since been deleted – along with the account – she claimed that she met Bieber when she was 21, and he was 20, at a music event in Austin.</p> <p>She claimed that on 9 March, after he performed a surprise set, Bieber invited Danielle and her friends to the Four Seasons hotel, where he took her to a separate room and assaulted her. The Guardian was not able to contact the woman to seek comment. She has given no further details of the allegations other than her Twitter post.</p> <p>The allegation was initially denied by Alison Kaye, the general manager of Scooter Braun’s SB Projects, who represents Bieber. Kaye said the allegation was “factually impossible”, saying on Sunday that Bieber stayed at AirBnB the night in question, and that his hotel reservation in Austin didn’t begin until the following night, and was at the Westin, not the Four Seasons.</p> <p>Later on Sunday, Bieber followed up with his own tweets, sharing photos, receipts and emails which he says show that he stayed at an AirBnb in Austin on 9 March, and at the Westin hotel on 10 March.

Their hope is that a cross-party amendment could be passed to change the law.</p> <p>During the second reading of the bill, Mercer was challenged by Labour’s John Healey as to why the government had refused to accept a recommendation from the independent Lyons review that cases of rape, murder and manslaughter “should be dealt with by the civilian justice system”, not the military courts.</p> <p>In reply, Mercer claimed Healey was wrong. “We cannot reject a recommendation that did not exist,” Mercer told MPs. “That was not the recommendation of the Lyons review, as the right honourable gentleman well knows.”</p> <p>Shaun Lyons carried out <a href=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/918867/SJS_Review_Part_1_Report_for_publication__accessible_.pdf"">the review of the military justice system</a>, which has long existed in parallel with the civilian system and is able to investigate and try the most serious criminal offences involving military personnel.</p> <p>Lyons’ first recommendation was: “The court martial jurisdiction should no longer include murder, manslaughter and rape when these offences are committed in the UK, except when the consent of the attorney general is given.”</p> <p>However, ministers rejected that recommendation last year. The MoD said the military justice system was “capable of dealing with the most serious offences and should be able to continue to do so” – a decision that prompted the women to bring the legal challenge.</p> <p>Following Mercer’s comments, the Centre for Military Justice, which was representing the three women, wrote to the MoD calling on the minister to urgently and publicly clarify his remarks.</p> <p>Emma Norton, the director of the centre, said: “Our clients were assured by the defence secretary that parliament would now have an opportunity to debate this issue fully. Parliament cannot do that if the position of the independent expert is being misrepresented by the minister.</p> <p>“Our clients have instructed us to request that the minister, if he concedes that he has misstated the position, correct himself in parliament and that he do so as soon as possible.” </p> <p>The MoD indicated it believed there was no need for Mercer to revise the parliamentary record. A spokesperson said: “The Lyons review did not recommend cases of murder, manslaughter and rape should not be tried in the service justice system, but that the consent of the attorney general should be required in these instances.”</p> <p>The spokesperson said the bill would also create a duty for the Crown Prosecution Service to work with its military equivalent to create a protocol on how serious crimes should be handled. This would establish, they said, “the most appropriate route to justice for each offence”.",False,pillar/news,News,"['rape', 'gang-rape']"

Yet Biden refuses to hold culprits accountable | Mohamad Bazzi,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/01/jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman-joe-biden,https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/01/jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman-joe-biden,"On Friday, Joe Biden’s administration confirmed what the world knew: that Saudi Arabia’s ruthless crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/26/jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman-us-report"">approved the assassination</a> of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Biden followed through on a campaign promise to release a summary report of the US intelligence community’s findings on the murder, and he undid two years of stonewalling by Donald Trump.</p> <p>But Biden failed to keep a more important promise: to hold Khashoggi’s killers accountable. Worried about disrupting the US-Saudi relationship, Biden decided not to impose sanctions on the crown prince. By giving the prince a pass, Biden skirted true justice for the murdered journalist and other dissidents who have suffered at Prince Mohammed’s hands. And, in turn, the reckless prince is unlikely to be dissuaded from more repression and crimes.</p> <p>Instead of targeting the prince, the Biden administration imposed travel bans and financial sanctions against some of his underlings who took part in Khashoggi’s assassination at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. The US also sanctioned the Rapid Intervention Force, an elite unit that protects Prince Mohammed and answers only to him. The US <a href=""https://www.odni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Assessment-Saudi-Gov-Role-in-JK-Death-20210226v2.pdf"">intelligence report</a> released on Friday said that seven members of the force were part of the 15-man team that killed Khashoggi.<strong> </strong>The report directly blamed the crown prince, noting that since 2017, he<strong> </strong>“has had absolute control of the kingdom’s security and intelligence organizations, making it highly unlikely that Saudi officials would have carried out an operation of this nature without the Crown Prince’s authorization.”</p> <p>Despite this evidence, Biden and his aides decided that Prince Mohammed was too big to punish. While <a href=""https://joebiden.com/2020/10/02/anniversary-of-jamal-khashoggis-murder-statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden/"">Biden had promised</a> during the presidential campaign to change the US-Saudi relationship, he reverted to his cautious nature. In the name of pragmatism, Biden resorted to the longstanding US foreign policy that looks the other way as America’s autocratic allies commit atrocities at home and abroad.</p> <p>Biden’s reluctance to hold Prince Mohammed accountable for Khashoggi’s murder raises doubts about whether the new administration will follow through on its pledges to remake the US-Saudi relationship. During a campaign debate in November 2019, <a href=""https://theintercept.com/2019/11/21/democratic-debate-joe-biden-saudi-arabia/"">Biden said</a> he would make the Saudis into “the pariah that they are”, adding that there is “very little social redeeming value in the present government”. He promised that his administration would not “sell more weapons to them”.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>By giving the prince a pass, Biden skirted true justice for the murdered journalist and other dissidents who have suffered at Prince Mohammed’s hands</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On 4 February, in his first major foreign policy speech as president, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/04/us-end-support-saudi-led-operations-yemen-humanitarian-crisis"">Biden pledged to end</a> US support for “offensive operations” in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Days earlier, his administration announced it would freeze two new deals with the kingdom, totaling nearly $800m in <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-administration-saudi-weapons-deal/2020/12/23/657cdc72-4565-11eb-8deb-b948d0931c16_story.html"">precision-guided bombs</a> and other weapons, that were rushed by Trump in his final weeks in office. Biden pledged to end American complicity in a war that has killed more than <a href=""https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/12/1078972"">233,000 people</a> and created the world’s <a href=""https://www.unicef.org/emergencies/yemen-crisis"">largest humanitarian crisis</a>.</p> <p>But Biden also promised to help Saudi Arabia defend itself against Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who have attacked Saudi territory with missiles and drones. That means the US will continue to sell some weapons and provide military assistance to the Saudis for defensive purposes. On 25 February, 41 progressive members of Congress <a href=""https://theintercept.com/2021/02/25/yemen-saudi-war-biden-democrats/"">sent a letter</a> to Biden asking his administration to clarify how it will distinguish between “offensive” and “defensive” arms sales and other types of military support for the Saudis.</p> <p>Prince Mohammed was the architect of the Saudi intervention in Yemen in 2015, expecting a quick victory against the Houthis, who are allied with Iran, the kingdom’s regional rival. But the war was the first in a series of destructive policies pursued by the crown prince that destabilized the Middle East. For four years, the Trump administration gave the prince and his regime a blank check, in exchange for continued weapons sales and stable oil prices.</p> <p>Biden has been less obsequious to Prince Mohammed than Trump and his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who struck up a <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/world/middleeast/saudi-mbs-jared-kushner.html"">close friendship</a> with the prince. But by refusing to sanction Prince Mohammed for Khashoggi’s murder, Biden hasn’t delivered the reckoning he had promised.</p> <p>And this will only embolden the prince. The Biden administration has essentially told Prince Mohammed that he’s too powerful to punish, even symbolically, as the kingdom’s de facto leader who is likely to ascend to the throne after his ailing, 85-year-old father, King Salman, dies or abdicates. Biden did not want to risk alienating the 35-year-old crown prince who could be king for decades.</p> <p>Biden and his aides seem to be relying on wishful thinking: that the prince would no longer try to hunt down, kidnap or kill dissidents outside the kingdom, fearing that a future crime could instigate US sanctions or other punishment. But since Khashoggi’s murder, the Saudi regime has continued its crackdown on political opponents at home and abroad. (Last month, a Saudi dissident living in Montreal <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/saudi-canada-dissidents-exiles-harbi/2021/02/26/464983b8-72cf-11eb-8651-6d3091eac63f_story.html"">disappeared after visiting</a> the Saudi embassy in Ottawa, and he recently emerged in the kingdom.) The problem with Biden’s wishful thinking is that Prince Mohammed, like other autocrats, will be emboldened to take greater risks, rather than showing restraint. Prince Mohammed may well conclude that, since he got away with Khashoggi’s murder, he could be more ruthless once he ascends to the throne.</p> <p>Some Biden aides argue that barring Prince Mohammed from travel to the US or targeting his personal wealth would not have a significant impact on the prince. But these sanctions would have had a symbolic effect, especially for a leader who is highly conscious of his image in the west. For years, Saudi leaders have spent tens of millions of dollars on public relations firms, lobbyists, think tanks, and cultural institutions that help burnish the kingdom’s image in the US and Europe. In 2017, the year Prince Mohammed consolidated power, the Saudis <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-saudis-washington-influence-machine-how-the-kingdom-gained-power-through-fierce-lobbying-and-charm-offensives/2018/10/21/8a0a3320-d3c3-11e8-a275-81c671a50422_story.html"">tripled their spending</a> on lobbyists and consultants in Washington, to more than $27m.</p> <p>That investment paid off in early 2018, six months before Khashoggi’s assassination, when Prince Mohammed <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/world/middleeast/saudi-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-us.html"">toured the US</a> and was treated like a rock star. He visited Silicon Valley, toured Harvard and MIT, met with Wall Street executives and movie stars, and even had a sit-down with Oprah Winfrey.</p> <p>The Biden administration says Prince Mohammed won’t be invited back to the US anytime soon, but sanctions would have embarrassed the prince and punctured his image as a young reformer and a strong leader. In fact, the US <a href=""https://www.odni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Assessment-Saudi-Gov-Role-in-JK-Death-20210226v2.pdf"">intelligence report</a> makes clear that Prince Mohammed is the ultimate toxic boss, noting that he “fostered an environment in which aides were afraid that failure to complete assigned tasks might result in him firing or arresting them”.</p> <p>By pledging to end US support for the Yemen war, Biden took the first step toward a more compassionate foreign policy. But he fell short in holding Prince Mohammed accountable for his human rights violations and repression. Biden missed an opportunity to restore confidence that, after Trump’s coddling of dictators, Washington won’t quietly provide cover to its autocratic allies.</p> <ul> <li><p>Mohamad Bazzi, a journalism professor at New York University, is a former Middle East bureau chief at Newsday.

It starts with a severely beaten man hanging upside-down off a building and only gets further away from Mary Poppins territory from there.</p> <p>But if you are nightmare-free, or not made peaky by the Blinders’ ways with a switchblade, you are in for a treat. Even the most brutal bits look beautiful and the story whips by so fast you will barely notice, much less care, that none of it is particularly new. </p> <p>Co-written by Gareth Evans and Matt Flannery, who made their names working on Indonesian martial arts films, Gangs of London centres on the Wallaces, a family of gangsters who are the premier predators in the city’s underworld. They marshal their rival gangs in a loose coalition, ensuring everyone can go about their lucrative businesses relatively unmolested.</p> <p>So, when the Wallace patriarch, Finn (<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/03/colm-meaney-the-journey-martin-mcguinness-interview"">Colm Meaney</a>), is assassinated, all hell breaks loose. We know it was done by a young lad, Darren, from the Travellers’ gang, but we don’t know who ordered the hit. The Wallaces suspect the Albanians, as the killing took place on their turf. Everyone else suspects everyone else, but nobody is too bothered except insofar as it affects business.</p> <p>But affect business it does. The Wallace empire is nominally headed by the man who built it alongside Finn – Ed (Lucian Msamati), his best friend since their hardscrabble childhood as victims of the “No blacks, no Irish” attitude that faced their families in 50s England. His attempts to keep everything on track while they find Finn’s murderer are undone in an instant by Finn’s hotheaded son and heir, Sean (<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jul/01/joe-cole-actor-interview-i-was-ready-to-deliver-a-kicking"">Joe Cole</a>), who wants retribution, as soon and as bloodily as possible. He announces the end of all factions’ freedom to operate until the killer is found.</p> <p>As the hunt expands, a lowly Wallace footsoldier, Elliot (a superb Sope Dirisu), seizes an opportunity to rise up the ranks. This is mostly achieved via two astonishing set pieces. First, a mass fight in a pub that looks scornfully at any other British pub brawl committed to film and says: “Hold my beer.” It involves a glass ashtray becoming part of someone’s face – before both are shattered on the edge of the bar – and a dart perforating more people more unpleasantly than you would have thought possible. Elliot barely has time to catch his breath before we are on to the second piece of impeccably choreographed carnage. This one involves a man mountain, a cleaver and no witnesses.</p> <p>Although the violence is explicit and extreme, it is not – quite – mindless. Its victims’ fear is palpable. Sometimes, so is its perpetrators’. It is almost a living, breathing being in some scenes, most notably in the pre-assassination of Finn and in the awful knowledge that falls on Finn’s loyal henchman as Ed talks to him on the sofa towards the end of the first episode. The violence is not integral to the story – they have chosen to include it, especially in such a form – but it is not shorn of all context or consequences.</p> <p>Overall, Gangs of London promises to be a wild and wildly polished ride, even before the twist at the end of the 90-minute opener. By the end, only Elliot has been granted enough humanity to make him anything more than a chess piece in the service of the plot, but there are hints elsewhere of more fleshing-out of others to come, which should keep viewers engaged during the bits where flesh itself is not flying. Sean’s weight-throwing is obviously masking some deeper doubts and insecurities; his sister Jackie is alienated from the family for reasons yet to be explored; and Ed’s son Alex seems to have some secrets. The question of quite what makes a family – how strong loyalties can be without a blood tie, how weak they can be despite them – runs underneath the whole story. If it is not sacrificed to spectacle in the coming weeks, there is going to be something really good here.",False,pillar/arts,Arts,['gang-rape']

If you did not know the story, you would probably have thought you were about to watch a re-examination of a murder investigation gone wrong and the righting of a terrible miscarriage of justice. The BBC eventually apologised and replaced the advert with something they said was more representative of the tone of the film.</p> <p>They should just have left it. It was a meretricious trailer for a meretricious film by a director – Daniel Gordon – who, in one of the press interviews for the series, said he was <a href=""https://www.salon.com/2020/09/27/30-for-30-oscar-pistorius-espn-daniel-gordon/"">“still flip-flopping”</a> on the matter of Pistorius’s guilt.</p> <p>Over five hours and 40 minutes, we get an exhaustive, exhausting account of Pistorius’s childhood, his medical history – born with fibular hemimelia, his feet were amputated at 11 months to give him the best overall mobility – his schooling, the death of his mother when he was 16, his training, his genuinely remarkable sporting achievements. We are offered a look at the growing adoration of South Africa for its golden boy as he racks up sprinting medals around the world, his successes at the Paralympics and his fight for permission to compete in the Olympics. The tone of these parts is hagiographic, which means the other parts – the darker parts, the more awkward parts – are edged with a kind of baffled sorrow. How, the film seems to ask, could all this glory fall away? </p> <p>Much emphasis is put on the trauma of his mother’s death, the pressure on elite athletes and the loneliness of the short-distance runner; the air of exculpation is all around. Growing up during a time of civil unrest that white South Africans found particularly threatening is adduced as a reason for Pistorius’s trigger-happy jitteriness when confronted with an apparent intruder. (Ah, apartheid. Such a terrible thing for affluent white families.) His former girlfriend Samantha Taylor describes how she, frightened, had to hide his gun during one of their rows, but there is no mention of the many other forms of abuse in their relationship that she has described elsewhere.</p> <p>What could have been an examination of the cultural convergence that makes South Africa one of the most dangerous places for women to live – a woman is killed by her partner there every eight hours – instead amounts to little more than a head shake over one man’s bad luck. His friends and family – including his uncle Arnold, who stood in loco parentis for much of Pistorius’s life, his brother, Carl, and his cousin Maria – dominate the time given to interviewees. They seem to feel that reporting how much he cried on the night of “the accident” is proof of his innocence. In the final episode, the naked pride that spreads over Maria’s face as she recounts how fervently Pistorius wanted Steenkamp’s family “to know that she wouldn’t choose a guy that would shoot her” is so bizarre that I had to rewind it twice to check what I was seeing and hearing.</p> <p>The court trial – including the astonishing disintegration of Pistorius’s testimony under questioning, followed by the manslaughter verdict that was later changed to murder and the sentence that was increased in severity twice under appeal – is crammed into the last half hour or so.</p> <p>Of course, you could not make this series a wider examination of domestic violence without undermining the notion on which the Pistorius phenomenon and his attraction to film-makers of a certain ilk depends: the idea that he is special. But Pistorius is the result of a society that treats women as second-class citizens, that lets men off the vast majority of the terrible things they do to them, that tells them money, talent and success will earn them yet greater freedom to do as they wish to whomever they wish. He is not special.</p> <p>The name of the 29-year-old woman he murdered – a law graduate, a model, the daughter of June and Barry, who broke her back in a horse-riding accident as a child and had to learn how to walk again, little of which was mentioned here – was Reeva Steenkamp.",False,pillar/arts,Arts,['domestic violence']

We are going to access funding and we are going to save the lives of women and girls,” she says, before explaining how tough the past four years has been.</p> \n<p>Munyasia is executive director of Reproductive Health Network Kenya (RHNK), which promotes health services, including offering information about abortion. This put the network in the sights of Donald Trump’s administration. In 2017, the US president used an executive order to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/15/trump-abortion-rule-mexico-city-policy"">reinstate the Mexico City policy</a> (also known as the “global gag rule”), which prohibits overseas organisations that receive US funding from using money from another source to do abortion-related work.</p> \n<p>The policy – usually rescinded by the Democrats and reintroduced by Republicans – has affected global family planning since it was introduced in 1984. Under Trump, the policy was expanded to cover almost all US bilateral aid for global health, affecting as much as $12bn (£8.9m) in funding.</p> \n<p>The policy had an immediate and devastating impact on Munyasia’s organisation. All of its funding came from the US, via Planned Parenthood Global (PPG), which had refused to sign the global gag order. RHNK lost as much as $1m a year. Munyasia had to stop outreach programmes to marginalised communities and halt the training of more than 500 health workers. Thousands of women couldn’t get contraceptives, HIV tests or cancer screening. Teenage pregnancies increased, and women resorted to unsafe abortions. Foetuses were found on riverbanks, Munyasia says.</p> \n<p>The organisation went from seeing 300,000 women and girls a year to just 150,000 over two years – thanks only to money secured through the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/dec/26/how-trump-gag-rule-inspired-worldwide-movement-shedecides"">SheDecides</a> movement.</p> \n<p>“We lost 100% of our funding.

Palmer said that she and her family had “received multiple threats”.</p> <p>The next day both Hartmann and Palmer filed affidavits in court seeking to reverse their certification of the Wayne county result, claiming that they had been promised internally that the vote would be audited, only to discover it would not be.</p> <p>The White House did not reply to a request for comment. Neither did Hartmann or Palmer. Trump inaccurately tweeted on Tuesday night that the board had declined to certify the Wayne county vote, indicating that he was following the process closely.</p> <p>The Michigan secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, said through a spokesperson on Thursday that the certification was final. “There is no legal mechanism for them to rescind their vote,” she said. “Their job is done and the next step in the process is for the board of state canvassers to meet and certify.”</p> <p>The vice-chairman of the Wayne county board of canvassers, Democrat Jonathan Kinloch, denied the substance of the affidavits, telling <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/11/19/wayne-county-rescind-certifying-election/"">the Washington Post</a> that the Republican pair understood the process and knew what they were certifying.</p> <p>Ever since Trump’s election loss two weeks ago, the Trump campaign has been filing lawsuits and applying pressure on Republican officials in multiple states in an effort to overturn the election result or, barring that, to spread the false belief that Biden’s victory was illegitimate. Polling indicates that they are succeeding in the latter objective with a majority of Republicans.</p> <p>Trump campaign tampering had not caused a serious hitch in the process of vote certification, however, until Tuesday night.</p> <p>Biden needs electoral votes to make his win over Trump official, although he defeated Trump in a sufficient number of states that he still would win in the electoral college even if the Trump campaign managed to steal the election in multiple big states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania.</p> <p>Separately in Michigan on Thursday, the Trump campaign withdrew an election-related lawsuit in federal court, making the false assertion in court documents that the Wayne county vote had not been certified. The Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani was leading that case.</p> <p>The Trump campaign’s legal strategy came under question in a separate case in Pennsylvania, where on Wednesday the campaign <a href=""https://twitter.com/nycsouthpaw/status/1329200499652956160/photo/1"">proposed</a> that the campaign itself should conduct a review of mail-in ballots and let the court know what it found.

As Liberal voters these women prefer a smaller role for government – managing the economy and then getting out of the way, keeping taxes low and eschewing any radical reform. In contrast, Labor is seen as inherently risky, the engineer that wants to challenge a status quo and build something better.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/mar/15/brittany-higgins-addresses-march-4-justice-rally-as-women-demand-action-across-australia"">Brittany Higgins addresses March 4 Justice rally as women demand action across Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If this theory holds the challenge for broadening female support for real gender-based reform must be more than calling out injustice.</p> <p>It starts with demonstrating to Liberal women voters that their personal experiences are part of a bigger picture; that assault, harassment and diminishment do not respect partisan divides; nor are they the end of the discussion. There is a bigger story: from superannuation skewed to the needs of male breadwinners to the way that economic policies designed to suppress wage growth inordinately impact women regardless of their voting history.</p> <p>Second, it’s about demonstrating that designing new systems to deal with gender inequity is not just worthy but realisable. After a year when the government rose to a global pandemic and intervened in the economy for the common good, now may be a time to tap this sense of possibility.</p> <p>Universal access to early learning that could provide women the choice between paid work and work in the home is one area of reform that was given a dry run in the pandemic and could become a feature of a more equitable society. More broadly, our newfound appreciation of the contribution of the caring industries to the nation provides a moment to consider their status and support in comparison to that given to the male-dominated extractive and construction sector.</p> <p>Third, the conversation with female Liberal voters involves demonstrating how what seems like the Liberals’ “hands-off” approach to government is actually not so benign: that the government is walking away from its responsibility andthat contracting out and privatising services is a conscious choice. It’s about drawing consequences for those decisions – privatising domestic violence support, turning aged care into a for-profit industry, refusing to fund the social housing that would keep many vulnerable women off the street.</p> <p>Most fundamentally, it involves agreeing on a common way of understanding this moment and naming it: our leaders are being asked to care about women and their experiences.</p> <p>Right now, in the face of stories of abuse and diminishment, the prime minister simply doesn’t seem to care enough to establish an independent inquiry to deal with allegations against the nation’s top law officer, which have been strenuously denied by the attorney general who says they just “did not happen”. And Scott Morrison doesn’t seem to care enough to address the vast gender gulf within its own ranks. Not caring actually lies at the heart of the laissez-fare approach to government that anchored Liberal thought: the conviction that government is the problem, intervention is futile and the most worthy will rise to the top.</p> <p>If harnessed, this could become a moment of social and economic transformation where the truths we have walked past for decades are finally named and addressed by a government prepared to start caring. I think many Australians are up for that proposition and that includes the Female Liberal Voter Who Might Change Her Vote, who are clearly ready to listen and just might decide the status quo is no longer worth voting for.

According to the Food Standards Agency, <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56032185"" title="""">44% of new ventures</a> registered since March 2020 are run from domestic kitchens, as new platforms emerge (<a href=""https://allaboutthecooks.co.uk/"" title="""">All About the Cooks</a>, <a href=""https://www.noshycircle.com/"" title="""">NoshyCircle</a>, <a href=""https://grubie.co.uk/"" title="""">GruBie</a>) to connect home cooks with hungry diners. Increasingly, anyone can compete with local restaurants to sell hot takeaways or ready-meals.</p> <p>“I want it to be as easy to sign-up to All About the Cooks as it is to let out a room on Airbnb,” says founder Claire Ladkin of the currently Bristol-only site. “There’s enormous talent in communities and little opportunity to share it. It’s difficult to get into food. You have to work evenings, start at the bottom in a restaurant or risk setting up as a business.” All About the Cooks wants to democratise getting started, nationally, in return for its 12.5% commission: “Enabling people who might find it difficult to make money if they have language barriers or caring responsibilities. The social impact is a massive driver.”</p> <p>Commercial home-cooking is not new. Street food traders and cake-makers frequently work from home. You may remember Prince Cofie Owusu who, after building a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/trapkitchen/"" title="""">serious following on Instagram</a> (now 144K followers) and, in 2018, appearing on BBC Two’s <em>Million Pound Menu</em>, went from dispatching meals from his mum’s Camberwell flat to running Trap Kitchen sites in Manchester, London and Birmingham.</p> <p>Covid-19 has supercharged that trend. For furloughed or newly unemployed chefs and keen cooks, it offers immediate income at a time when ordering food online has taken off to an extraordinary extent. As the profiles below illustrate, talented or social media savvy cooks can now quickly establish promising businesses.</p> <p>Realistically, most home-based businesses launched in the last year – 14,731 across the 187 local authorities using the Foood Standards Agency’s registration portal<strong> – </strong>will not create full-time jobs. Cooking at scale in a domestic kitchen is difficult. Many will remain part-time endeavours – side-hustles in unprecedented times. That flexibility is attractive. If you love food, you can work set hours, earn a little money doing something rewarding.</p> <p>Ladkin dreams of getting a home baker’s brownies into Waitrose. For most, ambitions are more modest: “Our cooks vary from talented home cooks to ex-professionals. But they all seem driven by a desire to share their food. They want it to be appreciated.”</p> <h2><strong>Chutima Honsakul, <a href=""https://thaiapron.co.uk/"" title="""">Thai Apron, </a>Leigh</strong></h2>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""143efac0645ab0ca9b6ff16e4b3d1ff90844ecf7""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/143efac0645ab0ca9b6ff16e4b3d1ff90844ecf7/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg"" alt=""Chutima Honsakul in her house with delivery boxes"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> </figure>  <p>Every Thursday, Chutima Honsakul is up at 3am to cook and pack around 20 meal-kits for national next-day delivery. “Night shifts are normal, for me,” says the 23-year-old, a furloughed casino cashier. “It’s something I’m passionate about. I don’t question it.”</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>We got rid of furniture to make more storage room</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Honsakul is on a mission and not just to dispatch her food in the freshest state possible. She wants, she says, to educate people on how to cook Thai food authentically. “I see bloggers on Instagram, posting Thai recipes, putting all these random ingredients in, and it infuriates me a bit.”</p> <p>Last year, that irritation was flipped into an Instagram page of recipes and food tips, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kceatsin/?igshid=cczyx9gb9zca&amp;amp;hl=en"" title="""">@kceatsin</a>. The positive reaction it received (4,800 followers and counting), set Honsakul thinking that – as other locked-down bloggers and amateur cooks began to retail food – there might be a market for her moo ping (pork skewer), laab gai (chicken salad) or pad thai finish-at-home meal kits (£6 to £32 for two people).</p> <p>She felt confident in her cooking, having learned from her mum, a former street food trader in Rayong and having worked in her uncle’s Thai restaurant for years, albeit waiting-on but watching the chefs closely.</p> <p>What followed was months of trial and error, learning about waste, portion control, packaging materials, mastering the 3D puzzle of the efficiently packed delivery box and rearrangement of Honsakul’s one-bed house. “We got rid of furniture to make more storage room, bought another cupboard for my inventory and another fridge,” she laughs. “It’s like a warehouse.” Honsakul’s partner also runs an e-commerce business from home. He understands the logistical issues.</p> <p>If all that sounds difficult, the bigger story of Thai Apron’s November launch – from finding a web designer on freelance job site, Fiverr, to sharing courier tips with fellow traders – is how easy Honsakul has found it to get advice, network and market the business, entirely online. To the extent, she is already pondering future expansion, post-pandemic: possibly employing an assistant, renting kitchen space, launching a street food stall.</p> <p>After ordering their food, Honsakul approached writer, cook and chilli oil maker, Pippa Middlehurst, AKA<a href=""https://pippyeats.com/about"" title=""""> @PippyEats</a>, and Manchester’s Yaoyao Noodles, for pointers: “They were really helpful. Yaoyao let me buy packaging and insulating liners from them – the websites want you to buy them in pallets and, obviously, I wasn’t doing that many orders – and I also make condiments which I sell on Pippy’s website.”</p> <p>Similarly, Honkasul’s “big break” came about from an online contact, the Little Pasta Company, recommending her to the Plateaway meal-kit platform. Illustrating how online can level the commercial playing field, Honsakul is listed <a href=""https://www.plateaway.com/"" title="""">on Plateaway</a> alongside established London restaurants including Bancone and Patty &amp; Bun. “It’s weird,” she says, clearly thrilled: “I’m still very small and there I am, next to Shoryu Ramen.”<br></p> <h2><strong>Paul Murashe, <a href=""https://www.ayobypm.com/"">AYO</a>, London</strong></h2>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""cd426f5c5ac8423ddf8a6efebe21ea241bcad04b""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/cd426f5c5ac8423ddf8a6efebe21ea241bcad04b/0_1043_8272_4963/1000.jpg"" alt=""Paul Murashe, the owner and founder of AYO"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> </figure>  <p>We’ve all experienced the pandemic differently but for Paul Murashe it has been “a rebirth”. “My life has taken this U-turn and I’m up at 6.30am with a jump in my step. I would never have this energy and positivity had the pandemic not put me in this position.”</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>These are creations from our heart. To deliver that to somebody is a pleasure</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Early last year, after a globetrotting restaurant career (Sydney, New York, London), latterly in senior management roles in Mayfair venues such as Sexy Fish and Nobu, 49-year-old Murashe was planning to open his own restaurant in Hackney Wick. The youngest of eight children from a “very humble” background in Sheffield, AYO (“joy” in Yoruba) was meant to be a reset for Murashe. “It was about getting away from Mayfair, making an imprint in a community, dedicating time to working alongside schools and older people – giving back.”</p> <p>Then Covid hit and by July that restaurant dream was dead. Murashe was shaken but undeterred. “Life had been turned upside down,” he says. “But I’ve got a new start.”</p> <p>Cooking care packages for friends, he began to think about creating high-end ready meals, based around his obsession with making the perfect organic lasagne. Turning that idea into abusiness producing around 30 handmade, personally delivered meal boxes each week (£60, two courses, two people) took several strokes of good fortune.</p> <p>Murashe had an extensive network of hospitality contacts who could help him finesse that lasagne (Hill &amp; Szrok beef, Neal’s Yard cheeses, hand-kneaded pasta) and, in October, he moved from his flat, with its two hotplates and mini-bar fridge, to live with a friend near Tower Bridge, whose spacious kitchen made production realistic.</p> <p>After a soft November launch, Murashe’s connections in food and PR paid off too, as he was contracted by Moschino to make food for the Christmas boxes it gives to key business contacts. Perfect for a man whose hand-tied, parchment packaging was inspired by Comme des Garçons: “It needed to be like a gift.”</p> <p>Murashe has moments of self-doubt, usually “at the beginning of the week, freaking out, when I can’t see any orders”, but business is building. He caps production at eight meal boxes a day. “I want it to be about excellence. That’s comfortable.” But he is already thinking of potential expansion into pasta classes, private dining and a more mass-market version of his ice-cream.</p> <p>Outwardly, Murashe has smoothly pivoted from one gilded career (“My boss was Robert De Niro” – one of Nobu’s founders) to another. He refuses to be drawn on his personal finances and how urgently or not he needed AYO to work. Either way, he is clearly a grafter. “As a kid, I didn’t do one paper round, I did two. I can’t sit on my hands.” He was pot-washing in Sheffield restaurants aged 15 and still works 12-hour days.</p> <p>His deliveries run into the evening, six days a week. “I don’t want to sound like a psycho, but these are creations we make from our heart. To deliver that to somebody, because I’m such a face-to-face person, it’s a pleasure.”</p> <p>Given that personal investment, any criticism must sting. “Everyone has a different palate,” says Murashe, diplomatically. “I’ve taken punches for 25 years. You grow a thick skin. Egos have to be pushed to one side. Having this career, then cooking – it takes a lot.”</p> <h2>Dan Kenny &amp; Luka Mokliak, <strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/five_star_kebabs/"" title="""">Five Star Kebabs</a>, Brighton</strong></h2>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""f99c413f51212e116c77645b5e453c37bfff8bd3""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/f99c413f51212e116c77645b5e453c37bfff8bd3/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg"" alt=""Dan Kenny and Luka Mokliak of Five Star Kebabs"" width=""1000"" height=""667"" class=""gu-image"" /> </figure>  <p>“Like most of the country,” says chef Dan Kenny, recalling the traumatic uncertainty of March 2020, “I spent the first week drinking heavily and two depressed months, thinking, ‘What the hell will we do?’”</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>We flogged kebabs from a window. It\xa0was fun for everyone in boring lockdown</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The answer, says Luka Mokliak, former head baker at St John in London, was “flogging kebabs from a kitchen window”. The kitchen window at Kenny’s flat in Brighton, in fact; a tiny space on a dimly lit, residential side street which, on Wednesday evenings last summer, the duo turned into the city’s hottest food destination. “It looked like a drug deal, handing brown bags out of a window,” says Kenny. “We’d play loud music. It was fun for everyone in boring lockdown. The neighbours liked it.”</p> <p>Prior to Covid-19, life was more sedate. Kenny, 36, owned the Set restaurant at the Artist Residence hotel, working alongside Mokliak in “a strange setup” where they created tasting menus for 12 diners every Monday to Wednesday. In May, furloughed and desperate for distraction, they began to discuss Five Star. The idea, says 35-year-old Mokliak, was to see “how good a kebab could be if we put all our knowledge into it”. By June, they were taking orders.</p> <p>Unable to afford a kitchen, Kenny read about people cooking from home. A friend designed a logo, Kenny spread the word on social media and they set about developing extravagant, £12 kebabs using salt-marsh lamb, glazed sweetbreads, chilli-bean braised pig’s head, wagyu beef and Exmoor caviar. The menu went up on Instagram every Friday. On Monday orders were accepted, then customers were given the address and a collection time, to avoid lengthy queues. People paid cash. Amazingly, in four months, Five Star had just one no-show.</p> <p>Selling 40-ish kebabs each week was easy; producing them less so. Working around their tolerant partners, Kenny and Mokliak prepped in their individual kitchens for days. “It really shows a home kitchen’s limitations. On a commercial induction hob, you can bring 20 litres of stock to boil in half an hour. At home, it took 12 hours. Bread was a massive issue too,” says Mokliak. “I’d mix 10kg of dough by hand, strip the fridge of normal food and fill it, then every Wednesday I’d be up at 5am shaping and frying flatbreads.”</p> <p>Add in a weekly deep clean that involved removing every domestic pan, jar and utensil, and, as enjoyable as it was, a regime this punishing was not sustainable in a one-bedroom flat. Not for such a modest profit.</p> <p>Kenny doesn’t rule out further residential pop-ups, but the regular service stopped in September and, since Christmas (the Set is due to reopen on a new site in May), the two have been in a professional kitchen developing Five Star meal kits for national delivery. A permanent venue may follow. As a still-surprised Kenny puts it, “It blew up.”",False,pillar/lifestyle,Lifestyle,['domestic violence']

Universities across Australia are struggling as their financial lifelines of international students have been reduced to a fraction of their pre-Covid levels, while the federal government <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/04/australian-universities-angry-at-final-twist-of-the-knife-excluding-them-from-jobkeeper"">excluded all but a few private unis from jobseeker</a>. To add insult to injury, the Morrison government decided to force students into “job ready” Stem courses <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/19/australian-university-fees-arts-stem-science-maths-nursing-teaching-humanities"">by doubling the cost of entry into some arts degrees</a>.</p> <p>With an estimated <a href=""https://www.universitiesaustralia.edu.au/media-item/covid-19-to-cost-universities-16-billion-by-2023/"">$4.8bn lost from Australian universities</a> in 2020, and as much as $16bn forecast in shortfall over the next three years, universities are <a href=""https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/08/25/macq-a25.html"">reducing staff</a>, <a href=""https://www.arts.unsw.edu.au/professor-claire-annesley/news/new-faculty-announcement"">amalgamating schools and departments</a>, and <a href=""https://www.maitlandmercury.com.au/story/7046266/university-of-newcastle-cuts-530-of-its-subjects/"">reducing course offerings</a>. And many are <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/dec/10/griffith-university-cuts-144-jobs-and-axes-queensland-college-of-art-photography-degree"">cutting their art schools first</a>.</p> <p>From a brutal neoliberal perspective this all makes sense: only the most profitable will survive. Art schools are seen as too expensive a luxury to justify the paltry metrics of their graduates, who are destined to spend at least the first 10 years of their careers just trying to break even. For the managerial thinkers of government, if you’re not in a high-paying job in 18 months in a law- or Stem-related career, it’s not worth bothering with. Universities have, to their credit, resisted cuts for as long as they could, but with massive shortfalls and a cruelly indifferent federal government, the axe had to fall.</p> <p>But for those who care about culture in a broader sense, you have to wonder where it’s going: have university art schools ever been truly viable? And is there an alternative for art education in Australia?</p> <p>From their beginnings in Australia as either private studio classes run by professional artists, or courses conducted through museums and galleries, visual art schools started to take on a more familiar contemporary form once their role had been expanded into technical colleges. The introduction of visual arts as an area for serious academic study in universities broadened in Australia the late 1940s and the lines between practical, skills-based art education and theoretical study became increasingly merged.</p> <p>In 1988 a sweeping range of reforms were introduced which saw amalgamation of independent creative arts courses offered by colleges of advanced education with universities. And that is more or less where we are today.</p> <p>The marriage, however, was always troubled, and the main cause of the friction was reconciling artistic creativity with traditional academic research. If a university is going to hand out degrees for artists, how is creative academic achievement measured? With all the closures, amalgamations and layoffs, that question will probably never be fully or satisfactorily answered. But maybe it was just a bad idea from the start.</p> <p>So what’s the alternative? Interestingly, the exhibition at Campbelltown Arts Centre provides some clues.</p> <p>The first is about size. During the era of amalgamations of art schools and universities, the trend was towards ever-increasing campuses spread across multiple sites, with all the attendant costs of running large organisations. It’s great while the money lasts but quickly seems like a crumbling empire when things go bad. In the face of all the recent cuts and calamity, smaller is better.</p> <p>And Space YZ shows what even a modest regional gallery on the outer fringe of a major city can do, staging an important, smartly curated historical overview that speaks to both a national crisis and a specific local context.</p> <p>The other clue is about nurturing a legacy: something that most large institutions only occasionally attempt, and even more rarely successfully achieve.</p> <p>Art schools have a variety of educational functions but they also have a broad cultural reach, influencing the communities that surround them. They don’t even have to be that large – this exhibition is named for a gallery that was just a corridor connecting two buildings – to create a sense of place. As Space YZ demonstrates, the long influence of generations of artists also created a legacy that’s felt even after the school has been closed for more than a decade.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""4954ff4443391299947bf0890f37978e89ee905e""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/4954ff4443391299947bf0890f37978e89ee905e/0_0_6016_4016/1000.jpg"" alt=""(L-R) White word I (1993) by Brook Andrew; Imaginary Gardens with Real Toads (1996) by Sherna Teperson; The Littlest Australian, Prinztronic, Dessies (!998) by Michael Lindeman.

As a colleague once suggested to me, all the old schools of arts and mechanics institute buildings dotted around the country could be ideal spaces for bespoke art schools of perhaps 100 students each. The logistics of how all that could happen are an issue – but maybe Space YZ offers one more clue.</p> <p>Michael Dagostino, the director of Campbelltown Arts Centre, said the answer is right there in front of us: regional galleries already take on many of the formal roles of art schools, offering studio-based education, lectures and talks, and all the stuff we associate with art schools – short of actually handing out degrees.</p> <p>For Dagostino’s gallery, Space YZ isn’t just a memorial to an important period in western Sydney’s cultural history: it’s also the suggestion of a possible future for an entire mode of education, and a way to nurture legacy and history. Instead of starting from scratch, regional galleries could form the basis and the venue for a brand new future for arts education. They’re local, they’re spread across the country, and the connection to community is profound.</p> <p><em>• <a href=""https://c-a-c.com.au/space-yz/"">Space YZ at Campbelltown Arts Centre</a> is open until 14 March</em></p> <p><br",False,pillar/arts,Arts,['forced marriage']

But like all apparently objective historical facts, this one feels more subjective the more you look at it. For whom, exactly, did the war end? Active hostilities may have ended on 15 January 1970, but politically, Biafran independence remains a fraught question. Meanwhile, one of war’s tragedies is always that it never really ends for those who survive. Ceasefires cannot erase scars, loss or memories.</p> <p>This lack of closure must have presented a challenge for Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie as she wrote Half of a Yellow Sun. On the one hand, there’s the natural breaking-off point at the declaration of peace. On the other, there’s the knowledge that to accurately represent the experience of her characters is to acknowledge the fact that they can never really leave their suffering behind.</p> <p>Those dates provide a further set of issues for readers. The knowledge that there must be some kind of end in sight kept me able to turn the pages during the harrowing descriptions of starvation and military brutality. But the probability that not all the characters would survive induced a certain amount of trepidation. Adichie wasn’t writing a fairy story. </p> <p>The decisions she made in navigating these difficult waters say a lot about her writing.</p> <p>In conventional dramatic terms, the character you might think is most likely to die is Ugwu. Almost as soon as war breaks out, he has a sword of Damocles hanging over him. He is the right age to be forced into the military – and also easily daft enough to wander on to the streets where the press gangs are likely to catch him. This latter quality makes you dread his fate.</p> <p>As well as making him an admirable, tender character, notable for his academic ability as much as his eagerness to fall in love, Adichie makes Ugwu the main focus for comedy in the novel. He is prone to doing absurd things like sleeping with chicken bones in his pockets and delighting in the sound of his master calling him an “ignoramus” – and this also makes him feel like a good potential victim. It’s often the comic relief and the lovable rogue who has to die. Think of Four Weddings and a Funeral. You don’t have to progress much beyond the first wedding to realise that the funeral will be held for Simon Callow’s sweary, wacky-dancing Gareth.</p> <p>But Half of a Yellow Sun isn’t that predictable. The usual dramatic arc is disrupted when Ugwu, having finally been forced into the army, is involved in a gang rape. He is no longer the adorable innocent we expect to love and lose. Now it even starts to feel like death may be a way for him to escape his burden of guilt. I know I had mixed feelings when the report came back to Ugwu’s employers that he had died. And more again when it was revealed that this report was wrong and Ugwu was in hospital.</p> <p>Still more complicated is the question of what happens to Kainene – and what to make of that loss. In the end it’s this character, who has always seemed the cleverest, the wittiest and the strongest, who doesn’t make it home. One day, she sets off to try to trade across enemy lines – and that’s the last anyone sees or hears of her. Rationally and emotionally, we know she must be dead. But because we never hear for certain we are left in the same position as her lover Richard: unclear about what has happened to her, dreading that it must have been awful, yet hoping against all probability that it might not be true. This disappearance feels all the crueller because it happens so close to 15 January 1970. </p> <p>Here, too, Adichie does just enough to wrongfoot her readers. She ends the book barely 20 pages after the radio announces the war’s end. It’s so abrupt that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/oct/12/book-club-half-yellow-sun"">when I first read the book 10 years ago, I wondered</a> if these final chapters felt “rushed”. Now I think we are left at the right point. Adichie allows enough time for her characters to return to their old homes – and for her readers to realise they can never really go home again.",False,pillar/arts,Arts,['gang-rape']

There was dried blood down the front of her smock. And her room was bare.</p> <p>“The thing that stood out to me the most about that room is that Melanie had graffitied the room with her own blood.

Appearing on Sydney radio station 2GB, Fuller conceded the idea might be “terrible”.</p> <p>“The app could be a terrible idea, but maybe in 10 years’ time that will be seen as the normal dating [method]. If you swipe left and right and there’s another option if you want to have intimacy,” he said.</p> <p>“I hope we don’t need to get to that point. I hope that we start the conversation at home and we start the conversation in schools about respectful behaviour.”</p> <p>In an interview on ABC radio, Fuller said the app could be “the worst idea I have all year”, while also stating “intimate violence, particularly against women, is a real problem crime for us at the moment and we need to find a solution”.</p> <p>At a press conference later on Thursday, the commissioner defended the idea while also clarifying he believed the app could be used to keep sexual assault out of the justice system, rather than as evidence.</p> <p>“People have mixed emotions about how the app would work. For mine the app keeps people out of the justice system, it’s not about how it works in the justice system,” Fuller said. “We already know the journey in the justice system is such a difficult one for victims.”</p> <p>Figures from the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research on Wednesday showed reported sexual assaults rose by 10% in 2020, with about 15,000 women coming forward. But only 2% of those led to guilty verdicts in court.</p> <p>Fuller said his app idea had been intended to “start the debate”. He said the justice system had been “overwhelmed” by the issue of consent.</p> <p>“This is one of those issues we need to face and we have to have the conversation about consent, we need our kids to have a better understanding and we need our juries to have a better understanding,” he said.</p> <p>Fuller seemed to suggest the consent app could be used either separately or integrated into existing dating apps. At the press conference, he said such an app could be used by people prior to going on a date. However, he also questioned whether that would work.</p> <p>“When people are dating online, and it is just dinner, then just be clear it’s just dinner, and it’s not victim-blaming, and being intoxicated is OK, but perhaps you need to protect your friends a bit better when they are intoxicated and not let them go home with someone,” he said at one point.</p> <p>“There is a range of things I’d love to come out of this, and the app is not necessarily one of them, but starting the conversation is, and the app has at least brought this issue up and people are talking about it.”</p> <p>Fuller’s idea was roundly panned online on Thursday. But some people took a more diplomatic view.</p>  <figure class=""element element-tweet"" data-canonical-url=""https://twitter.com/stilgherrian/status/1372321818892066818"">  <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">Just one thing on the “consent app” for sex thing.

It’s about people respecting other human beings regardless of who they are or what they look like. Everyone has the right to go about their business and not be challenged. It goes a lot deeper than sport but seems to be a common experience in sport.”</p> <p>Linington-Payne normally trains on the track. “It’s a closed environment with people who are like-minded,” she said. Currently only individuals classified as “elite” athletes by Sport Wales can travel to train. It means some athletes who perform at a high level and even represent Wales have to train on the street or in parks.</p> <p>She said she was concerned not only for top athletes but for leisure runners who were facing harassment. “We’re saying people can go and do exercise but it’s dark and the street lighting isn’t great in some places.”</p> <p>Hannah Brier, a Wales and Great Britain sprinter, from Neath in south Wales, said it was ironic she was not allowed on the track for safety reasons but did not feel secure training in public. She has taken to wearing plainer and looser running kit.</p> <p>Brier said: “Before lockdown I’d never experienced running on the road before, as I’m always running on the track or training in the gym. I was completely shocked by the amount of inappropriate comments.</p> <p>“There was one occasion in the summer where it was around 34 degrees and I was training in shorts on the road, where a car came past, slowed down, shouted a comment towards my shorts and then drove off. I soon recognised that the same car had turned around at the end of the street and drove back up the street, [with the people inside] shouting inappropriate comments.</p> <p>“The car turned around three or four times, and made me feel really uncomfortable. I had to ring my dad to come pick me up because I no longer felt safe training by myself or walking home after training.</p> <p>“It’s not fair and it’s not acceptable whatsoever. The more people speak out and say their experiences, the more their voices will be heard.” </p> <p>Lauren Williams, a 400-metre hurdler from Powys, mid-Wales, said it was only recently that she had felt unsafe training. She has also received comments on her kit being too revealing. She <a href=""https://twitter.com/laurenwills_99/status/1356525641420668928"">tweeted</a>: “I am hoping that by speaking out we will see changes and women will feel safer to get out and exercise in public.”</p> <p>James Williams, the chief executive of Welsh Athletics, said it was working with south Wales police to promote a campaign called Exercise our Freedom. He said: “We support the right for everybody to train and enjoy their exercise, and everyone should be able to do so without the fear of unwanted comments or behaviours.</p> <p>“Covid has meant that the normal safe training environments have been removed – running groups can’t run together, so the safety in numbers aspect is no longer available. With facilities being closed, more and more are having to be creative with their training – hence running on roads as opposed to a track where we could tackle this form of behaviour immediately.”",False,pillar/sport,Sport,"['child abuse', 'sexual abuse']"

Last year, they were one-in-five of all dole recipients.</p> <p>Since 1991, the proportion of women over 45 on jobseeker benefits has increased sevenfold, the PBO paper shows.</p> <p>The researchers said during the 1990s and early 2000s jobseeker recipients had typically been young men in their 20s and 30s, while older men and women were likely to be receiving other benefits such as parenting payment, the age pension, or disability support pension.</p> <p>“However, by 2019, this picture of recipients by gender and age group had changed considerably,” they said.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2020/sep/26/in-this-recession-low-paid-women-and-those-without-a-degree-are-being-hit-hardest-in-australia"">In this recession, low-paid women and those without a degree are being hit hardest in Australia | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although the bulk of the paper examines the pre-Covid era, researchers warn the trends identified are unlikely to be altered by “short-term fluctuations in unemployment”.</p> <p>They argue unemployment benefits now appeared to “function as a kind of pre-age-pension payment for some older Australians”.</p> <p>The result is that over three decades, those on unemployment benefits have been likely to spend longer on a payment that has hardly changed in value. Jobseeker benefits are subject to tougher indexing arrangements than pensions, though it was temporarily boosted for the pandemic.</p> <p>In 1991, the fortnightly rate of the jobseeker payment was $276.50. The payment was $565 a fortnight before the pandemic, or $815 with the current coronavirus supplement.</p> <p>But the PBO put the inflation-adjusted value of the pre-Covid benefit at only $288.</p> <p>Cassandra Goldie, the chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service, said the report was “deeply concerning” given the country was experiencing “one of the worst recessions of our history”.</p> <p>“We must ensure that those people who could not get paid work even before this crisis hit, including older women, are not left behind in entrenched unemployment,” she said.</p>  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2020-09-30T04:59:12/embed.html"" data-alt=""PBO""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2020-09-30T04:59:12/embed.html"">PBO</a> </figure>  <p>The other large shift noted by the PBO is that those on jobseeker payment are far more likely to have barriers to full-time work such as caring responsibilities or a disability.</p> <p>Conny Lenneberg, the executive director at the Brotherhood of St Laurence, told Guardian Australia women who lost their jobs at a mature age often faced discrimination from employers.</p> <p>“There is this sort of presumption that because you’re older, you won’t be able to manage in the modern workforce,” she said.</p> <p>Another issue was that women working in customer-facing industries such as retail or tourism were usually passed over for younger candidates.</p> <p>“There’s a bar on appearance that really does impact on older women,” Lenneberg said.</p> <p>The Howard government introduced the notion of ‘partial capacity to work’ in 2007 to reduce spending on disability payments.

He has been arrested on suspicion of indecent exposure related to a second person.</p> <p>The news comes after days of campaigning from friends and family to find Everard. Her partner, Josh Lowth – who spoke to her for 15 minutes during her walk home – made a plea on social media on 8 March. He said: “Sarah is still missing. Please share this post to help us to find her. Today, more than ever, we miss our strong, beautiful friend.”</p> <p>Everard studied geography at Durham University from 2005 to 2008.

We should not underplay just how incredible it was to see a biracial Indian and black woman accept the nomination for vice-president of the United States. We should not forget how much work it took to get to this point. As Harris said in her powerful acceptance speech, generations of women paved the way for this. They “marched and fought – not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table.”</p> <p>But while it’s important to celebrate progress, it’s also important to acknowledge that the Democratic party still doesn’t seem very keen on giving progressives a seat at the table. The DNC may have handed the mic over to women but there is one group of women they seem intent on shutting up: <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/17/the-squad-name-origins-aoc-ilhan-omar-ayanna-pressley-rashida-tlaib"">the Squad</a>. Not a single one of the progressive young congresswomen who make up the Squad were asked to speak at the DNC.</p> <p>What about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, you might ask? She spoke for a whole 60 seconds! She certainly did, but she wasn’t invited by the DNC, she was <a href=""https://twitter.com/SawyerHackett/status/1296584700950175751?s=20"">invited by Bernie Sanders</a>. As <a href=""https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1295902565750771717?s=20"">AOC explained on Twitter</a>, DNC rules require a roll call and nominations for every candidate that passes the delegate threshold. Sanders passed the threshold and AOC was asked to endorse him. Despite this being standard practice some parts of the media, including NBC, <a href=""https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1296466407853559809?s=20"">willfully misinterpreted it</a> and cast Ocasio-Cortez as a troublemaker who had hijacked the convention. (AOC, of course, immediately called NBC out on this.)</p> <p>Ocasio-Cortez is probably the most exciting politician of our time. She, along with the other members of the Squad, have inspired and energized young people and progressives around the world. They’ve helped to demystify politics. They’ve given people hope that we might see a more equitable future. Why were they shunned by the DNC? Why did the establishment think that it was more important that we hear from Sarah Cooper, a comedian, rather than AOC? Why did the DNC deliberately omit progressive voices but invite the likes of former Republican presidential candidate, Governor John Kasich, who <a href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-do-democrats-prefer-never-trumpers-to-the-squad"">defunded Planned Parenthood</a> in Ohio, to speak in a primetime slot? Why did the DNC elevate the likes of Bill Clinton – who still needs to <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2020/08/18/photos-allegedly-show-bill-clinton-receiving-massage-from-jeffrey-epstein-accuser/#2030"">answer questions</a> about his involvement with Jeffrey Epstein – and ignore Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar?</p> <p>Pragmatism, obviously. Democrats know the left has nowhere to go and so they are able to treat progressives with disdain and focus their energies, instead, on pandering to Republicans who might cross over the aisle. I understand the strategy here. I understand the importance of getting rid of Trump; of course I do. But that doesn’t mean we can’t ask the Democrats to do better; that doesn’t mean we can’t ask the Democrats to stop taking the left for granted. There is nothing the establishment loves more than talking about “unity” – they would do well to remember that that means making progressives feel included as well.</p> <h2>James Blunt once got scurvy in a quest to be a Real Man</h2> <p>The man famous for warbling “you’re beautiful” <a href=""https://jezebel.com/james-blunt-developed-scurvy-after-adopting-an-all-meat-1844787028"">apparently got scurvy</a> when he was a university student after eating nothing but meat and condiments for two months.

They have claimed that he intimidated young officials by threatening to end their careers if they did not have sex with him.</p> <p>“He harassed us,” said one alleged victim who did not want to be named. “If you want to have a career, to referee tournaments, the only person who can make that happen is Grant. He uses it as a leverage. To be selected, we have some tests, physical for example. Some girls passed the test but they’re not selected. We have some girls who didn’t go to the physical test but are still selected because they sleep with Grant. It’s very simple.”</p> <p>Another added: “I’m still a referee so I have to be very careful but the situation isn’t acceptable. We’re harassed, blackmailed. If you want to have a career, to referee tournaments, to go abroad, Grant is the only one that can make happen. Obviously we were shocked but what can we do? It’s the way things work in all the federation. For the girls, you have to give your body if you want something. Most of us came from poor families. To become a referee or a football player is a way to get out of poverty. For some of them, it’s a simple choice because they don’t have the choice.”</p> <p>Another former referee who came under Grant’s jurisdiction has also claimed that he attempted to take her virginity when she was 17, below the age of consent in Haiti.</p> <p>“I spent several years as a referee and it was a constant fight,” she said. “When I was 17 years old, Grant tried to take my virginity. In exchange, he promised me so many things … That’s how they do it. They helped some girls in a way that they can’t speak out. Sometimes, I have nightmares about him and the things he did to me. He ruined my career and a part of my life. He’s evil.”</p> <p>Another alleged victim added: “I suffered a lot. It’s very hard for me to talk because of what he did to me. The abuses took place in hotels like the Servotel or the Kingdom. Sometimes at his place. He promised me a lot of things, even to help me find a job and money. He also helps some girls get US visas.”</p> <p>One of the alleged victims has also accused Grant of supplying girls for some of the Fifa officials who attend an annual seminar in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince.</p> <p>“The worst thing is that he sends some referees to the Fifa instructors who are coming each year,” she said. “That’s why no one talked. What can we do or say if members of Fifa are also involved? We see Grant as powerful, even with Fifa.”</p> <p>Grant did not respond to questions from the Guardian detailing the allegations made against him. “Unfortunately, I cannot speak with you, because I am discussing with another institution on this subject,” he said. “Please understand that confidentiality is required. Sorry.”</p> <p>Guerrier, who has served as the FHF’s executive secretary for several years, did not respond to allegations that he blackmailed girls into having sex with him so they would be granted visas to travel to the United States. “The Fifa ethics committee has already asked me questions about the allegations of abuse of the FHF, and it’s confidential, I’m sorry.”</p> <p>One of his alleged victims said: “The federation uses the passport and the US visa to obtain what they want from us. In Haiti, obtaining a visa to the US is everything and these people can help on that. They know how important it is for young people to go abroad, so if you want the visa …”<br><br>She added: “The federation usually keeps the players’ passports without their consents. For example, Guerrier told one of the girls that he would have to have sex with her before giving her passport and a recommendation letter to go get a visa. Fenelus is also involved in sexually abusing these young girls – he asked me several times to have sex with him and I [would] obtain my passport.”</p> <p>Fifa said it is “aware of the ongoing allegations and a full investigation is currently ongoing together with relevant national and international authorities”.",False,pillar/sport,Sport,"['child abuse', 'sexual assault', 'sexual abuse']"

Her lawyer, Lewis Power QC, said her legal team would challenge the conviction and were prepared to take the case to the European court of human rights.</p> <p>Although the case is far from over, Cypriot officials are clearly relieved that the negative publicity that has swirled around the country as a result of the often controversial court proceedings is out of the spotlight – for now.</p> <p>The Cyprus Mail, the island’s English-language daily, described authorities as being “cautiously optimistic” about the threat of a tourism boycott of the island. The proposed boycott, initiated on social media, was publicly backed by the teenager’s mother.</p> <p>“There is no indication yet that it has [affected us] despite what some people are saying,” said the deputy tourism minister, Savvas Perdios.</p> <p>In Ayia Napa, where the rape was alleged to have happened, owners of the few businesses still open were sanguine about their prospects, if angry at the way the case had evolved.</p> <p>“Young Brits won’t stop coming here. They love it,” said Agapios Agapiou, a local restaurateur. “Ayia Napa is a small place. Ask anyone and they will tell you too much was made of the story. The court was very lenient with her. If the town had been defamed in England the way Ayia Napa has the girl would have got a much harsher sentence.”</p> <p>Yiannis Karoussos, mayor of the resort at the time of the alleged gang-rape and now a minister in the government of Nicos Anastasiades, has said repeatedly that the Briton “owes Ayia Napa an apology” for the damage she had caused the town.</p> <p>The 19-year-old woman flew into London Heathrow from Larnaca on Tuesday after spending a month in prison.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, the Briton was handed a four-month jail sentence suspended for three years for wilfully indulging in public mischief for the offence of fabricating “an imaginary crime”.</p> <p>After the sentencing, she hugged her family and legal team, leaving the Famagusta district court in Paralimni in tears. Her mother shouted to supporters outside: “She’s coming home.”</p> <p>Two passengers who had been booked on to the British Airways flight the teenager boarded with her family agreed to take a later plane so she could get home sooner.</p> <p>Speaking to the Sun, the young woman said: “I am innocent and the fight will go on to clear my name. It’s been a nightmare for me, Mum and everyone. Now I just want to be with my friends and family.</p> <p>“What kept me going was my family and the amazing support of my friends and all other people who got in contact to say they believed me.”</p> <p>Cypriot police claimed she lied about being attacked by up to 12 Israelis in an Ayia Napa hotel room on 17 July.</p> <p>A dozen young men and boys aged between 15 and 20 who had been arrested over the incident were freed after she signed a retraction statement.</p> <p>The teenager was then stuck in the country for nearly five months after being charged.

Twenty-eight years after Stephen died, it is also a good time to contemplate where British society goes from here in the fight for racial justice.</p> <p>The <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/macpherson-report-what-was-it-and-what-impact-did-it-have"">Macpherson </a>report had 70 recommendations. Sadly, some of those important recommendations have yet to be implemented. But the single most significant thing that the inquiry did was to label the official reaction to Stephen’s killing “institutionally racist”. Sir William Macpherson said that the Metropolitan police investigation had been undermined by “professional incompetence, institutional racism and a failure of leadership”.</p> <p>It is important to remember what a seismic effect Macpherson’s use of the phrase had. Some of us, as campaigners against racism, had talked about the police and institutional racism for some time. It was one thing for black people to use the phrase but for a white, then 72-year-old former high court judge who lived in a Scottish castle to acknowledge institutional racism was quite extraordinary.</p> <p>Macpherson did not start off as a believer in the concept. In fact, some of us were sceptical that a pillar of the establishment was the right person to lead the inquiry. But he was persuaded by the evidence that he heard in the course of his inquiry. Hugh Muir, a Guardian journalist who covered the inquiry, described how <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/feb/15/william-macpherson-an-establishment-man-with-a-sense-of-outrage?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other"">Macpherson’s demeanour</a> went from “scepticism to concern, to shock to incredulity”. And it was precisely because he was an establishment figure that his findings carried such weight.</p> <p>But, if Macpherson’s acknowledgement of institutional racism was seismic, then this government’s attempt to deny institutional racism in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/31/uk-an-exemplar-of-racial-equality-no-10s-race-commission-concludes"">the recent report</a> by the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, led by Dr Tony Sewell, was not just seismic but shocking. Many commentators have remarked how incoherent is the report. A UN working group has <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/19/no-10-race-report-tries-normalise-white-supremacy-un-experts"">said</a>: “In 2021 it is stunning to read a report on race and ethnicity that repackages racist tropes and stereotypes into fact, twisting data and misapplying statistics and studies into conclusory findings and ad hominem attacks on people of African descent.”</p> <p>But this report was bound to be muddled. In practice, the conclusions were determined long before any investigation or research was done. The No 10 official behind it was the head of the policy unit, Munira Mirza. She has worked closely with Boris Johnson since he was mayor of London. And she has long been hostile to the idea of institutional racism, describing contemporary accusations of it, in 2017, as reflecting “<a href=""https://www.spiked-online.com/2017/09/11/lammy-review-the-myth-of-institutional-racism/"">more perception than reality</a>”. She has further complained about “<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/15/dismay-over-adviser-chosen-set-up-uk-race-inequality-commission-munira-mirza"">a culture of grievance</a>” among anti-racist campaigners. So the report ended up cherry-picking data from existing research to confirm its <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/16/government-race-report-evidence"">predetermined </a>worldview. As a result, academics, including the world-renowned public health expert <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/07/sewell-report-structural-racism-research"">Sir Michael Marmot</a>, were soon <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/12/bodies-credited-in-uk-race-review-distance-themselves-from-findings"">queuing up</a> to say that they had not been properly consulted and their work was misrepresented.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/21/derek-chauvin-conviction-limits-george-floyd-death"">Celebrating Derek Chauvin’s conviction is not enough. We want to live | Derecka Purnell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sewell’s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/31/racial-disparities-in-the-uk-key-findings-of-the-report-and-what-its-critics-say"">report</a> is a determined attempt to take the debate on race in this country back to a time before Macpherson. Back then, black people who tried to talk about racism were routinely described as having “a chip on their shoulder”. In other words, the problem lay with black people themselves, not with society or the institution that they were talking about.</p> <p>Finally, there is no policy issue where a denial of institutional racism is more dangerous than education. The life chances of millions of black young people depend on education. The institutional factors that are behind black children not fulfilling their educational potential have been known for decades. They include: the low number of black teachers, the curriculum, policy on exclusions, some teachers preconceptions, lack of support for black parental involvement, and the attitude of educationalists. But by downplaying the reality of institutional racism, the government relieves itself of the responsibility of doing anything about these things. The new <a href=""https://raceequalityineducationappg.org/"">all-party parliamentary group</a> for race equality in education, of which I am chair, will be tackling all these issues in the coming months and years.

We also know issues such as obesity and diabetes are increasing. Investing in school nurses can go a long way to reducing the impact of these issues, which can have lifelong consequences.”</p> <p>Kinnair has made the call in a manifesto of ideas to improve health in the UK produced by the College of Medicine. The group of health professionals want to “redefine medicine beyond pills and procedures” and use both conventional and non-conventional ways of treating illness, for example thorough “social prescribing” – advising patients to take part in social and recreational activities such as walking, dancing and gardening to tackle depression and loneliness instead of taking antidepressants.</p> <p>The group includes Sir Sam Everington, a GP who is highly-admired for improving the health of poor and multi-ethnic communities in the East End of London, and Michael Dixon, a family doctor in Devon, former chair of the NHS Alliance and health adviser to Prince Charles. </p> <p>They write: “The College of Medicine believes physical, mental and social health needs to be the focus of all schools. This can only be done with a full-time nurse in every school and on every governing board.”</p> <p>There is currently only about one nurse for every 10 of England’s 21,000 state schools, so nurses generally work in a number of schools.

General Franco’s nationalist troops had taken the town days earlier. Political prisoners filled the jails; posters of Mussolini, Franco and Hitler, the “strong men” of fascist Europe, plastered the walls, and hit squads were executing republican sympathisers.</p> <p>Into this maelstrom tripped a 23-year-old Englishwoman wearing a floral print dress. Her mission: to connect with the American consul and find the famous writer Arthur Koestler, who had been taken by Franco’s men. She was also secretly recording Italian troop movements to show how Italy had breached international neutrality agreements.</p> <p>Discovery would mean certain imprisonment or worse.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/01/the-golden-age-of-female-journalism-was-won-by-the-nameless"">The \'golden age\' of female journalism was won by the nameless</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What prompted this young woman to face dangers in the dark streets of Málaga? And why, finding the imposing entrance of the American consulate locked for the night, did she climb over the garden wall and present herself to the surprised consul who, remembering his manners, invited her to dinner?</p> <p>Shiela Grant Duff’s father had been killed in the first world war, and she was convinced that as a foreign correspondent reporting the rise of fascism across Europe, she could persuade the world that Hitler must be stopped. But she was denied the newspaper support structures afforded men. When she approached the <em>Times</em> for a job, the editor Geoffrey Dawson told her foreign correspondence was no job for a woman. Spurned and freelance, Grant Duff took off alone. Her journey into Spain, via north Africa and across the Mediterranean into Gibraltar, was inspired by her desire to prove she was every bit as brave and capable as a man.</p> <p>She had already seen at first-hand how untrammelled nationalism could turn ordinary, God-fearing people into supporters of brutality. In January 1935, on a freelance commission for the <em>Observer,</em> she had travelled to Saarbrucken, then a League of Nations protectorate, to cover the Saar plebiscite. The Saar region, 730 square miles of coal-rich hills abutting Luxembourg, had been confiscated from Germany at the Versailles peace negotiations. The plebiscite over the Saar’s return to German control in January 1935 was marked by extreme German brutality, forcing Jews, communists and anti-fascists to flee to France.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""1704e270b2a89a4a1d2e4442420227a221eef448""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/1704e270b2a89a4a1d2e4442420227a221eef448/0_99_4961_2977/1000.jpg"" alt=""Nazi flags Saarbrucken 1935"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Shiela Grant Duff covered the Saar plebiscite for the Observer in Saarbrucken, 1935.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The coverage in the British press was characterised by relief that the whole thing was over, that Hitler, having got back the Saar, would pipe down. Grant Duff, independent of the diplomatic press corps, stayed on in Saarbrucken and watched. She wrote in the <em>Observer</em>: “The million swastikas which hang on the walls in the Saar give the impression that a plague of spiders has descended …The Nazis can tell their enemies by their eyes. Panic can be seen in all the gestures and bearing of working class women who tell how they have been threatened, how they have been mocked and spat upon … Others … tell how their doors have been broken open in the middle of the night.”</p> <p>Grant Duff used her press credentials to help smuggle typewriters, activist literature and arms across the border into France.</p> <p>She paid heavily for her engagement in a world that excluded most women, suffering from sickness and anxiety, rejected by the diplomatic press corps and the subject of vile rumours that she slept with Nazis for stories. Grant Duff was an outsider, but she was not alone: many pioneer women were striving to get a toehold in the masculine world of journalism during the 1920s and 30s, often using ingenious, dangerous or devious methods to participate. In my book, published this week, I uncover the hitherto overlooked work of many interwar women journalists asserting their voices in a world narrated by men.</p> <p>The Jamaican poet Una Marson, facing the twin obstacles of sexism and racism, became editor of <em>The Keys,</em> a newspaper promoting understanding between people of all colours. She campaigned against the “colour bar” that had prevented her from finding work when she arrived in England in 1932, and for women’s groups to recognise that the struggle against patriarchy must include the struggle against colonialism.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""37c6e037a9ff0e68f7c2ff08feb6683fa5a654d0""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/37c6e037a9ff0e68f7c2ff08feb6683fa5a654d0/747_1069_4452_5561/801.jpg"" alt=""Alison Settle, on assignment for the Observer, France 1944."" width=""801"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Alison Settle, on assignment for the Observer, France 1944.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: University of Brighton Design Archives/Tricolor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marson paid heavily for transgressing into a world that resisted her when she was forced out of her producer job at the BBC by powerful white men. Similarly, Margaret Lane, the <em>Daily Mail</em>’s “star” reporter, had to deny scandalous rumours about her sex life – from atop a desk in the paper’s newsroom – and Stella Martin was demoted to becoming her paper’s “zoo correspondent” after criticising the women’s page as a vehicle for consumerism and advertising.</p> <p>The humanitarian Francesca Wilson, who travelled interwar Europe helping victims of war and famine from Russia to Spain wrote of their plight in the Quaker publication <em>The Friend</em>, and the <em>Manchester Guardian</em>. Revolutionising the way humanitarian agencies viewed recipients of aid, she refused to see them as passive victims but as humans full of latent potential that only needed enabling. In the hills above Málaga, at about the same time as Grant Duff was climbing into the American consul’s garden, Wilson was creating a farm for 50 Spanish boys, refugees from Franco. There they grew tomatoes, corn and peppers and showed how having ownership of the land turned them from helpless victims to healthy farmers.</p> <p>Then there are the lifelong friends Edith Shackleton and Alison Settle who, as women’s page editors on two rival tabloids, wrote each other’s fashion and celebrity copy, swapping articles and bylines so that both might survive in that cutthroat world. Settle became editor of <em>Vogue</em> and then the celebrated <em>Observer</em> women’s editor. Having “made it”, she still faced prejudice. In 1944, sent to Holland to cover the German retreat, she arrived at a Brussels aerodrome to find that the army escort, supplied to all accredited correspondents, had been refused to her by General Montgomery, who hated women journalists. Undeterred, she hitchhiked to the frontline from where she wrote stirring stories of the Dutch fleeing the advancing armies, their goats, cows and brooms tied together with sheets. Unable to reach the men in charge, she wrote instead of the “odds and ends” of war, the civilians whose lives had been destroyed.</p> <p>Her story, and others, show how equality must be fought for, and how even small gains must be fiercely guarded to be maintained.</p> <p><em>Rebel Women Between the Wars</em><em> by Sarah Lonsdale is <a href=""https://manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/9781526137111/"" title="""">published by Manchester University Press</a></em",False,pillar/news,News,['women killed over honor']

I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives.”</p> <p>Since then, prominent figures have publicly argued against her position, including actors who have worked in the Harry Potter franchises <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/08/daniel-radcliffe-jk-rowling-transgender-tweets"">such as Daniel Radcliffe</a> and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/10/eddie-redmayne-joins-daniel-radcliffe-in-opposing-jk-rowling-trans-comments"">Eddie Redmayne</a>, the non-binary celebrity Jonathan Van Ness and the trans author Juno Dawson.</p> <p>In her essay, Rowling writes of her own struggles with sexism and misogyny, and her adolescent sense of being “mentally sexless”, adding that reading accounts of gender dysphoria by trans men had made her wonder “if I’d been born 30 years later, I too might have tried to transition”.</p> <p>“The allure of escaping womanhood would have been huge. I struggled with severe OCD as a teenager. If I’d found community and sympathy online that I couldn’t find in my immediate environment, I believe I could have been persuaded to turn myself into the son my father had openly said he’d have preferred,” she wrote.</p> <p>Rowling said she had initially been moved to share her thoughts after reading about <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/17/transgender-reforms-will-not-diminish-womens-rights-scottish-government"">proposed “gender confirmation certificates” in Scotland</a>, which will allow trans people to change sex on their birth certificates based on how they identify and not medical and psychiatric reports. She accused her critics of “groupthink” and “relentless attacks”, saying that while she believed trans people needed and deserved protection due to the high rates of domestic and sexual violence they endure, she did not agree that trans women who have not undergone hormone therapy or surgical transition should have access to single-sex spaces.</p> <p>“When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he’s a woman – and, as I’ve said, gender confirmation certificates may now be granted without any need for surgery or hormones – then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside. That is the simple truth,” she wrote.</p> <p>She said the criticism had left her “in a very dark place inside my head, as memories of a serious sexual assault I suffered in my 20s recurred on a loop. That assault happened at a time and in a space where I was vulnerable, and a man capitalised on an opportunity. I couldn’t shut out those memories and I was finding it hard to contain my anger and disappointment about the way I believe my government is playing fast and loose with women’s and girls’ safety.”</p> <p>She also confirmed for the first time that she had suffered physical abuse in her 20s. “If you could come inside my head and understand what I feel when I read about a trans woman dying at the hands of a violent man, you’d find solidarity and kinship,” she wrote.</p> <p>Citing an unnamed poll, Rowling claimed that those who did not support preserving single-sex spaces were “only those privileged or lucky enough never to have come up against male violence or sexual assault, and who’ve never troubled to educate themselves on how prevalent it is”.</p> <p>She said she had been contacted by “huge numbers” of women who were afraid to speak publicly about trans reforms, and decried institutions and organisations she once admired for “cowering before the tactics of the playground”. She said she believed misogyny and sexism were reasons behind the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/22/nhs-taken-to-court-over-fertility-services-for-transgender-patients"">4,400% increase</a> in the number of girls being referred for transitioning treatment in the past decade.</p> <p>“I’ve read all the arguments about femaleness not residing in the sexed body, and the assertions that biological women don’t have common experiences, and I find them, too, deeply misogynistic and regressive. It’s also clear that one of the objectives of denying the importance of sex is to erode what some seem to see as the cruelly segregationist idea of women having their own biological realities or – just as threatening – unifying realities that make them a cohesive political class … It isn’t enough for women to be trans allies. Women must accept and admit that there is no material difference between trans women and themselves,” she wrote.</p> <p>The essay prompted a heated debate on Twitter. On Wednesday evening Emma Watson, who played Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter films, <a href=""https://twitter.com/EmmaWatson/status/1270826851070619649"">tweeted</a>: “Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren’t who they say they are.”</p> <p>In a second tweet, she said: “I want my trans followers to know that I and so many other people around the world see you, respect you and love you for who you are.”",False,pillar/arts,Arts,"['sexual assault', 'domestic violence', 'sexual abuse']"

More than 40 women have submitted written testimony attesting to claims of abuse, one attorney on their case said.</p> <p>These women, who have been detained by Ice at Irwin county detention center in Georgia, have alleged that they underwent invasive and unnecessary medical procedures. The women’s attorneys have also alleged that these women endured retribution for speaking out, including deportation in some cases. The petition largely echoed past legal filings and accounts by accusers.</p> <p>“Petitioners were victims of non-consensual, medically unindicated and/or invasive gynecological procedures, including unnecessary surgical procedures under general anesthesia, performed by and/or at the direction of [gynaecologist Dr Mahendra Amin],” the petition said. “In many instances, the medically unindicated gynecological procedures Respondent Amin performed on Petitioners amounted to sexual assault.”</p> <p>Officials were aware of this alleged misconduct since 2018, the petition further alleged, “but have nonetheless continued a policy or custom of sending women to be mistreated and abused by Respondent Amin … The experiences Petitioners had at the hands of Respondent Amin form part of a disturbing pattern of inhumane medical abuse and mistreatment at ICDC.”</p> <p>“This is an effort to protect women who have suffered horrendous medical atrocities while detained in US custody, and every effort has been made by both Ice and the contractors at this facility to cover up these medical abuses,” said Elora Mukherjee, director of Columbia Law School’s Immigrants’ Rights Clinic, a leading attorney on the case.</p> <p>She added: “For more than two years, both the government, and the private contractors who run this facility, have turned a blind eye to the enormous suffering and intentional harm–and intentional medical abuse – that has taken place here.”</p> <p>“It’s unlike anything I ever expected to see in America,” Mukherjee said.</p> <p>The women’s allegations emerged after a shocking whistleblower <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/14/ice-detainees-hysterectomies-medical-neglect-irwin-georgia"">report</a>. This report, which was submitted on behalf of a former nurse at the facility, Dawn Wooten, alleged that an alarmingly high number of hysterectomies were performed on Spanish-speaking women. Wooten and other nurses feared that these women did not understand the procedures they underwent.</p> <p>Wooten alleged that the doctor performing these procedures, who was subsequently named as gynecologist Dr Mahendra Amin, had become notorious for performing these operations – so much so that she called him the “uterus collector” in her whistleblower account.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/21/congress-ice-gynecologist-abuse-allegations-petition"">‘He hurt me’: migrants who accused Ice gynecologist of abuse speak out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Everybody he sees has a hysterectomy – just about everybody,” Wooten <a href=""https://theintercept.com/2020/09/15/hysterectomies-ice-irwin-whistleblower/"">stated</a> in her complaint. “I’ve had several inmates tell me that they’ve been to see the doctor, and they’ve had hysterectomies, and they don’t know why they went or why they’re going.”</p> <p>Wooten also said that the medical center where these procedures were performed had unsanitary conditions, as well as poor safety measures against Covid-19.</p> <p>Amin has denied the allegations and told <a href=""https://theintercept.com/2020/09/15/hysterectomies-ice-irwin-whistleblower/"">the Intercept</a> that he had only conducted “one or two hysterectomies in the past two [or] three years”. He did not specify whether these procedures were performed on women in Irwin.</p> <p>The physician’s lawyer, Scott Grubman, said in a previous statement: “We look forward to all of the facts coming out, and are confident that once they do, Dr Amin will be cleared of any wrongdoing.” Ice contended that its records indicate just two referrals for hysterectomies at Irwin.</p> <p>The accusations have spurred comparisons with the US’s disturbing history of eugenics. From 1907 to 1937, two-thirds of US states passed laws that permitted involuntary sterilization – resulting in the sterilization of more than 60,000 people.</p> <p>An increase in federal funding for reproductive health procedures in the 1960s and 1970s, in conjunction with racism and anti-immigrant sentiment, resulted in “tens of thousands” of women of color undergoing sterilizations. </p> <p>Though forced sterilization was made illegal, it has continued.

The MPs hope it will tackle serious problems in the industry which they heard included “hyper-masculine, homophobic and sexist” promoters, “fundamentally exploitative” working practices and a “toxic” culture.</p> <p>British wrestling has been on the rise in recent years after a period in the doldrums when it was dropped from the TV schedules in 1985. Training schools, with names like House of Pain and Knucklelocks, have produced homegrown stars including Scotland’s Drew McIntyre and Tegan Nox from Wales, who have been signed to the WWE – the US wrestling promotion giant, which has also an outpost in the UK.</p> <p>Audiences have been growing steadily in areas such as south Wales, Newcastle, London and Birmingham. One promoter in the capital – putting on freewheeling US-style shows – was attracting about 700 people to monthly shows before the pandemic.</p> <p>But what some term a “performance sport” and others a “contact art” has been largely unregulated and the report identifies concerns about sexual abuse and misconduct, wrestlers being paid less than the minimum wage, an absence of concussion protocols and dangerous practices such as “blading” by wrestlers to create drama with real blood.</p> <p>The MPs now want ministers to classify wrestling training as a sport so safeguarding concerns can be handled through existing disputes processes operated under the auspices of Sport England and its equivalent bodies in the other UK nations. It would mean, for example that wrestling schools would have to ensure criminal record checks for coaches, which are currently not required. It would also mean wrestling could access government support, needed now during the pandemic, which it is currently denied by Sport England and the Arts Council.</p> <p>Last summer, wrestling had its own #MeToo movement, known as Speaking Out, and one of its co-founders, the retired wrestler Sierra Loxton, told the committee “there were no rules, no one was in charge, people were groomed, abused and then ‘gaslighted’ or victimised”. She said it wasn’t just at wrestling shows where problems occurred but also at post-show events and after parties.</p> <p>“I was floored by some of the harrowing first-hand evidence we heard from women, men and children: how they were treated in terms of pay and conditions; a lack of concussion protocols,” said Labour’s Alex Davies-Jones who led the committee.</p> <p>“In wrestling there has been a culture of toxic masculinity. There have been claims of rape. We have evidence of people as young as 13 being sexually assaulted by older wrestlers, female wrestlers being told they will have to sleep their way to the top. We encouraged anyone who spoke out about abuse to go to the police.”</p> <p>One witness, herself a victim of alleged sexual assault, told the MPs she “witnessed and was subject to instances and a culture of sexism, misogyny, bullying, abuse of power and an overly sexualised atmosphere towards women in general”.</p> <p>One promoter, Progress Wrestling, said it welcomed the report.</p> <p>“The root of all the problems is the lack of a regulation body from the schools to the promotions,” a spokesperson said. “It is only the start, but it has to be welcomed because regulatory change is required.”</p> <p>The MPs’ verdict that the shows amount to theatre is unlikely to upset many in the industry. The MPs were told by ring announcers, crew and fans “in no uncertain terms” that it was showbusiness with one witness saying that to think of it as a sport is “insulting to actual sportsmen”.</p> <p>As another witness put it: “Wrestling is a form of theatre that demands the same amount of respect and discipline as sport, that can be as spontaneous as improv comedy or be as planned and choreographed as a West End musical.”",False,pillar/sport,Sport,"['rape', 'sexual abuse']"

However, the RFU has stopped short of following World Rugby, which has banned trans women from the international game after warning there was “at least a 20-30% greater risk” of injury when a female player is tackled by someone who has gone through male puberty.</p> <p>While acknowledging that as a contact sport player welfare is paramount, the RFU also says in its draft proposals that it aims “to strike a balance between fairness, inclusion and safe participation”. In a video that will accompany the draft document, the RFU states: “We understand there are several misconceptions about transgender participants in rugby as well as in wider society. The policy aims to provide a fair opportunity for all those who wish to take part.</p> <p>“It’s important to consider the individuals involved and the sense of community and acceptance that our transgender players tell us rugby provides for them.”</p> <p>Last year World Rugby’s working group reported that players who are assigned male at birth and whose puberty and development is influenced by androgens/testosterone “are stronger by 25%-50%, are 30% more powerful, 40% heavier, and about 15% faster than players who are assigned female at birth”. It added that those advantages were not significantly reduced when a trans woman takes testosterone-suppressing medication, as was previously thought, and that a ban on trans women from women’s rugby was justified on safety grounds.</p> <p>As things stand, the RFU follows the International Olympic Committee’s guidelines, which allow trans women to compete in women’s sport if they take hormone suppressants to lower their testosterone to below 5nmol/L for at least 12 months. However, in its draft document the RFU acknowledges for the first time that recent research has forced a rethink – after scientists “identified that differences in height, weight and strength provide transgender women with a potential advantage over cisgender women”.</p> <p>As a result, the RFU proposes that transgender women applicants should provide their weight and height as “an initial indication of any physical potential advantage”. It then suggests that a coach should conduct an assessment of the player in an appropriate training environment.</p> <p>This would review “a) if the player has or may have a material performance advantage over other participants; and/or b) there is or may be a safety risk to other participants which is above the level presented by cis women players at the level of the competition/rugby in which the player wishes to participate”.</p> <p>The RFU draft policy was questioned by the women’s advocacy group Fair Play For Women. “The RFU now appears to accept that there are performance and safety concerns,” its spokesperson Nicola Williams said. “But it has come to a very different conclusion to World Rugby – one that risks trading the safety of one group for the inclusion of another.”</p> <p>The LGBTQ organisation Stonewall also said it disagreed with the draft policy as it excluded some people from playing sport. Maria Munir, associate director of community engagement, said: “No one should be excluded because of who they are and it’s vital that everyone – including trans and non-binary people – is given the opportunity to play the sports that they love.”</p> <p>Over the past three years the RFU has received 39 applications from trans men, seven from trans women and four players identifying as men but wishing to continue playing in women’s rugby. All have had to be cleared and approved by an independent panel.</p> <p>The draft policy also requires trans men to sign a waiver saying they understand the risks involved if they want to play men’s rugby.",False,pillar/sport,Sport,['women killed over honor']

The company has no plans for further purchases, and says the small amount of masks it imported were mainly kept for internal staff use.</p> \n<p>Xu said Uighur workers were generally kept under heavy surveillance, including through an app on their phone, WeChat groups, and by police officers and factory managers.</p> \n<p>She said in 2020 China, “you don’t need a whip, you don’t need brutal force, you just need all these surveillance measures in place and no one will dare oppose”.</p> \n<p>“When they get shipped out, according to multiple documents including state media and government documents, every 50 workers have one minder, and sometimes there are Xinjiang police officers who travel with them,” Xu told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>“They arrive at the factory, they work, and outside of work hours they have to study Mandarin, they have to take these political classes that are basically indoctrination sessions. They live in segregated dormitories and eat at segregated canteens.”</p> \n<p>“We couldn’t see and visit every factory that we looked into, but the factories that we did visit … there are barbed wire fences around the factory, there are watchtowers, there is a police station inside the factory compound, there are AI cameras.”</p> \n<p>Xu did not visit the Hubei Haixin factory.</p> \n<p>The lack of transparency in supply chains makes it extraordinarily difficult for companies to be checked for the use of Uighur labour, but that shouldn’t let them off the hook, Irwin said.</p> \n<p>“We all know that the [Chinese] supply chains are designed murky to avoid complicity in these very issues,” he said.</p> \n<aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/06/atrocity-of-the-century-uighur-activist-urges-australia-to-take-tougher-stance-against-china"">\'Atrocity of the century\': Uighur activist urges Australia to take tougher stance against China</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Australian companies in this case need to take a hard look at their supply chains and determine whether it is even possible to understand if they are sourcing from factories implicated in forced labour. If they are doing so, they are implicated in the much broader abuses.”</p> \n<p>China’s PPE supply has been contentious throughout the pandemic.</p> \n<p>When the outbreak began in China, officials, expats and companies rushed to buy up medical equipment around the world and ship it home. When the burden of infection shifted to the rest of the world, China increased production and began shipping planeloads of equipment to virus-hit countries as “aid”, and to others as commercial supply.</p> \n<p>The ramp up in production and supply was dubbed “face mask diplomacy”, and conflated with international politics and reputation-building more than with altruism. Chinese authorities were forced to repeatedly alter export requirements after shipments of faulty goods.</p> \n<p>As hostilities deepened between Beijing and western powers including the US, UK and EU, “aid” shipments were concentrated towards African and South American nations, and previous recipients of Belt and Road investment.</p> \n<p>In recent months China’s treatment of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, as well as its growing aggression in Hong Kong and the South China Sea, has <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/13/china-announces-retaliatory-sanctions-against-us-officials-ted-cruz-marco-rubio"">sparked international sanctions</a> and seizures of tonnes of goods believed to be associated with forced labour.</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Pei Lin Wu</em",False,pillar/news,News,"['forced marriage', 'forced abortion']"

The policies, said Eliza Byard, executive director of Glsen, a group that works with LGBTQ+ youth, forced trans students across the country to return to using incorrect facilities, a practice that has been linked to increased rates of assault and other serious harms. The damage will be lasting, she said: “What has been taken from them can’t be undone.”</p> <p>Many of Trump’s policies were challenged in court. In a major victory for LGBTQ+ rights groups, the supreme court <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/jun/15/supreme-court-civil-rights-law-lgbtq"">ruled</a> in June that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act does protect gay and trans workers. But Trump’s term coincided with reports of <a href=""https://www.glsen.org/research/2019-national-school-climate-survey"">increased bullying and harassment</a> in schools, a <a href=""https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/new-fbi-hate-crimes-report-shows-increases-in-anti-lgbtq-attacks"">surge in hate crimes</a> and <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/10/14/transgender-murders-reach-least-32-year-surpassing-record/3639313001/"">record levels of violence</a>.</p> <p>Bucci-Mooney, the trans student, came out when he was 12 at the start of Trump’s presidency. He said he was taunted and bullied when he played on the boy’s soccer team, and that he eventually quit. Now on the wrestling team, the high school junior said it would be a relief to have federal policy that supports his basic right to exist.</p> <p>Trump’s rules “validate the idea that we are not human beings, that it’s OK to discriminate against us simply because we were born in the wrong body, that it’s OK to take away a student’s right to feel safe”, Bucci-Mooney said. “These are children we are talking about.”</p> <p>Nic Talbott, a 27-year-old Ohio resident, was working with an Air Force National Guard recruiter when Trump announced the ban on trans people in the military, forcing him to abandon his plans.

These are some of the challenges rape victims face in getting their cases to court.</p> <h2><strong>Rape myths</strong></h2> <p>Myths and misconceptions about what a rape victim should look and sound like can present challenges in a case, including where alcohol has been involved or where the victim has mental health issues.</p> <p>Although in 90% of rapes the parties are known to one another, acquaintance rapes can be difficult to prosecute. “We still hold a lot of myths and stereotypes about what makes a ‘good’ rape victim,” says Katie Russell, from the charity Rape Crisis.</p> <p>“There are a lot of very practical issues with the prosecution of cases where one party says it was consensual and the other party doesn’t. The cases that are easier to pursue from a police and CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] perspective, and will gain more sympathy from juries, are stranger rapes, where there are obvious signs of physical violence.</p> <p>“In many cases, where there are clear vulnerabilities, we are seeing that is working against complainants … Cases that involve alcohol, where the defendant is known, cases where the complainant has mental health problems.” </p> <h2><strong>Digital strip searches</strong></h2> <p>Police can request a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/25/revealed-uk-police-demanding-access-data-potential-rape-victims"">wide range of personal records</a> from complainants in the process of investigating a rape. This typically includes a complete download of mobile phone data and in many cases victims are told <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/21/people-report-rape-routine-demands-mobile-data"">their case will not go ahead</a> without the information.</p> <p>The process has been criticised as highly invasive and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/17/police-in-england-and-wales-dropping-inquiries-when-victims-refuse-to-hand-in-phones"">likened to a digital strip search</a>. This is believed to be one of the reasons many people are <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jul/17/one-in-70-recorded-rapes-in-england-and-wales-led-to-charge-last-year"">dropping out of investigations</a> – 41% of complainants did not want to proceed with an investigation after reporting rape in 2019-20.</p> <p>This month it was announced that the form used to request data from complainants <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jul/16/police-and-cps-scrap-digital-data-extraction-forms-for-cases"">had been scrapped</a> following a legal challenge from two survivors of sexual abuse, in a case brought by the Centre for Women’s Justice.</p> <h2><strong>Changes to </strong><strong>CPS treatment of rape</strong></h2> <p>Prosecutors within the CPS say there has been a change in how rape is treated. In 2018 the Guardian revealed that prosecutors had been urged to take a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/sep/24/prosecutors-rape-cases-cps-crown-prosecution-service-conviction-rates"">more risk-averse approach</a> to prosecuting rape. Training workshops outlined how the CPS could increase its conviction rate if it prosecuted fewer cases that might be seen as weak by a jury. At the time, the conviction rate stood at 57.6%, which has since increased to 68.5% – a record high, but the number of prosecutions has plummeted.</p> <p>End Violence Against Women and the Centre for Women’s Justice say the changes amount to a substantive change in policy and are applying for a judicial review into the actions of the CPS.</p> <h2><strong>Fewer referrals from police</strong></h2> <p>Police are less likely to refer a report of rape to the CPS for prosecution than they were three years ago. Referrals from police have dropped 40% since 2016-17, despite an increase in reports. Police have also <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/13/senior-police-officer-raises-concerns-over-prosecutions"">raised concerns</a> that the CPS has taken a risk-averse approach to pursuing rape cases.</p> <h2><strong>Cuts to services</strong></h2> <p>Police and the CPS have undergone cuts resulting in the disbanding of specialist rape units in police forces and increased pressure across the criminal justice system.</p> <p>Russell says: “Unless you are a certain kind of person and raped in a specific way it is extremely difficult to get a charge – the system is completely broken. It’s an outrageous failure of a huge group of people. If it was any other crime there would be so much more urgency.”",False,pillar/news,News,"['rape', 'gang-rape']"

Yet since the opening in January of the centre in the capital, Accra, many people have received death threats and online abuse.</p> <p>The centre was closed preemptively, its founder said, to protect its staff.</p> <p>Although same-sex relationships are illegal in Ghana, the law is rarely enforced, according to a 2018 <a href=""https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/01/08/no-choice-deny-who-i-am/violence-and-discrimination-against-lgbt-people-ghana"">report</a> by Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>However, the opening of the centre amplified discrimination against the community, said activists. Fatima Derby, a feminist writer, said LGBTQ+ Ghanaians were “under threat” after the “uproar” caused by the opening of the centre.</p> <p>“It’s really disappointing the way the space has been treated. It’s also really disappointing the way LGBTQI+ individuals have been treated by politicians, religious leaders and even ordinary citizens.</p> <p>“For a long period of time, LGBTQ Ghanaians have been treated as disposable, but I think now it is becoming more amplified,” she said.</p> <p>“A lot of politicians have used this opportunity to gain favour once again from the electorate by being homophobic, because they know the population is largely homophobic.”</p> <p>Last week, Sarah Adwoa Safo, <a href=""https://www.myjoyonline.com/lgbtqi-is-criminal-non-negotiable-per-our-laws-adwoa-safo/"">newly elected minister for gender and children</a>, told a parliamentary committee: “The issue of LGBTQI is an issue that when mentioned creates some controversy, but what I want to say is that our laws are clear on such practices. It makes it criminal.</p> <p>“The criminality of LGBT is non-negotiable and our cultural practices also frown on it.”</p> <p>At a recent press conference, Ghana’s information minister, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, said the government was considering introducing legislation against LGBTQ+ advocacy. “We should be able to contemplate legislation in the interest of public morality, which will not be against the constitution but will now say that you cannot advocate for and promote LGBT activities in this country,” he said.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/nov/23/nowhere-to-go-the-young-lgbt-ugandans-outed-during-lockdown"">‘Nowhere to go\': the young LGBT+ Ugandans ‘outed’ during lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The community centre was set up by LGBT+ Rights Ghana. A fundraising event to mark the opening was attended by the Danish ambassador, the Australian high commissioner and EU delegates, which caused outrage and prompted repeated claims that the international community was promoting LGBTQ+ rights.</p> <p>On Saturday, the Ghana Catholic church bishops’ conference released a statement demanding the centre be shut down and condemned “all those who support the practice of homosexuality in Ghana”.</p> <p>“The EU should not impose their so-called values and beliefs on Ghanaians who are also against homosexuality,” it said.</p> <p>It urged the government “never to be cowed down or to succumb to the pressure to legalise the rights of LGBTQIs in Ghana”.</p> <p>The bishops’ comments made the front pages of a number of newspapers on Monday.</p> <p>In response to the criticism, the EU diplomatic mission in Ghana posted a message of support on Facebook saying: “Equality, tolerance and respect for each other are core values of the EU. The EU supports civil society organisations promoting #LGBTIQ rights.”</p> <p>Derby said claims that being gay went against Ghanaian culture, or was a result of western influence, were false and propagated by the church and the media.</p> <p>On Tuesday, LGBT+ Rights Ghana <a href=""https://twitter.com/LGBTRightsGhana/status/1364572338667327488?s=20"">tweeted</a> that its offices had been raided and closed down by the police. The organisation had already received threats from opposition groups that the community centre would be destroyed.</p> <p>On Monday, it urged people in the community not to panic but to stay safe. “This is not the best time to invite strangers over or visit strangers,” said the organisation, which was founded in 2018 to provide support for LGBTQ+ Ghanaians. People should “avoid staying alone in risk zones”, it added.</p> <p>In an earlier statement the group said: “The fundraising activity [at the centre] has unfortunately sparked negative reporting riddled with false narrations in the Ghanaian media.

My current situation in life is that I am happily married – have been for over 30 years – to a woman who is also a lifelong member of the Anglican communion. However, in 2014 I transitioned, and changed from my birth gender, as a man, to my present gender, as a woman.</p> <p>Just for clarity, then, I would be interested to know whether the Church of England’s latest teaching (<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/sex-married-heterosexual-couples-church-of-england-christians"" title="""">New C of E statement on sex in civil partnerships condemned as confused</a>, 24 January) says that my marital relationship with my wife is problematic because we are both women? Or whether it says that I am “not really a woman”, and so my marital relationship at any rate is quite unproblematic?</p> <p>To put it another way, I am wondering whether the church’s attitude to me now is essentially one of homophobia, or transphobia. I look forward to its pastoral guidance on this difficult question.<br><strong>Prof</strong><strong> Sophie Grace Chappell</strong><br><em>Dundee</em></p> <p>• The pastoral guidance issued by Anglican bishops is staggering in its naivety and stupidity. The bishops, some of whom are now women, of course, seem to regard sexual activity as an entirely avoidable activity, separate from a normal, intimate, mutually supportive, committed and loving relationship between two civil partners, whether they are men, women or men and women. Is it any wonder that intelligent human beings will simply think, as I do: what possible relevance does this ridiculous state institution have in the 21st century?<br><strong>Dr Clive Sellick</strong><br><em>Barton Turf, Norfolk</em></p> <p>• The Church of England’s position that sex belongs only within heterosexual marriage highlights the need for church and state to go their separate ways. The church’s heartless, discriminatory and repressive stance will only accelerate its decline in public support and relevance – and the state should respond accordingly.</p> <p>An organisation claiming that so many have no right to a sexual life should have no official ties to the state, no automatic right to seats in our legislature and no role in running state-funded schools.<br><strong>Keith Porteous Wood</strong><br><em>President, National Secular Society</em></p> <p>• I had to read your report on the church’s new guidelines on marriage discipline twice, as I couldn’t believe my eyes. For clergy to be told not to bless civil partnerships between heterosexual couples is astonishing and outrageous. A civil partnership should be the norm for all couples without exception, as on the continent, with a religious ceremony to follow for all who wish it.

William Barr, the US attorney general, has designated her the <a href=""https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-and-federal-info/federal-death-penalty/executions-under-the-federal-death-penalty"">eighth prisoner</a> to be judicially killed since he made the controversial decision to restart federal executions in July.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/17/lisa-montgomery-first-female-federal-inmate-executed--67-years-brandon-bernard"">Lisa Montgomery to be first female federal inmate executed in 67 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Montgomery’s last hope of staying alive was to petition for clemency – which in capital cases is seen as the final remedy to prevent miscarriages of justice where all other appeals have been exhausted. But her prospects of a reprieve plummeted recently when both the federal public defenders who have represented her since her conviction fell sick with Covid-19.</p> <p>Kelley Henry and Amy Harwell visited Montgomery at a federal medical center in Carswell, Texas, as part of the process of preparing her clemency appeal. The lawyers traveled to Carswell on 19 and 26 October and 2 November. They developed symptoms of the illness days later.</p> <p>But a federal judge signaled reluctance on Monday to grant Montgomery, the only woman on federal death row, extra time.</p> <p>In a hearing in US district court for the District of Columbia, Judge Randolph Moss questioned why lawyers for the convicted woman had not completed a draft of the clemency petition sooner, saying he believed Montgomery could still authorize other attorneys to proceed on her behalf.</p> <p>In a previous <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EPswUcfY3HuaCVe11aHbcYEmjeSaVzjm/view"">court filing</a>, Montgomery’s defense team excoriate Barr for pressing ahead with federal executions in the middle of a public health emergency that has struck with especially fearsome force in US prisons. Henry and Harwell only fell sick, the memo states, because Barr “recklessly scheduled Mrs Montgomery’s execution in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic”.</p> <p>In addition, mental health experts familiar with Montgomery’s case are unable to assess her mental state “and therefore cannot participate in the clemency process”. The lawyers have asked for an injunction postponing the execution until a thorough clemency appeal can be prepared.</p> <p>Montgomery was sentenced to death in 2007, for murdering Bobbie Jo Stinnett and extracting her baby from the womb. The only woman among 55 inmates on federal death row, she would become the first female prisoner to be executed by the US government <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/17/lisa-montgomery-first-female-federal-inmate-executed--67-years-brandon-bernard"">since Bonny Brown Heady in 1953</a>.</p> <p>Any clemency petition is likely to focus on the horrifying childhood to which Montgomery was subjected. According to court documents, she was born with brain damage related to her mother’s alcohol intake during pregnancy and went on to suffer incest, gang rape and child sex trafficking, as well as physical abuse and neglect.</p> <p>Montgomery’s alcoholic stepfather began abusing her when she was 11, keeping her locked up in isolation and raping her on a weekly basis. The shocking litany of abuses has left her with severe mental health issues including psychosis and hallucinations.</p> <p>When she learned on 16 October that Barr had ordered her execution, Montgomery became so distressed that she was placed on suicide watch. She has been under constant surveillance in solitary confinement ever since. While on federal death row at FMC Carswell she is being given anti-psychotic, anti-epileptic and anti-depressant drugs.</p> <p>The pending execution of a female survivor of sexual abuse and domestic violence with severe mental challenges has prompted an outpouring of revulsion around the country and the world. A group of 41 current and former federal and state prosecutors wrote to Donald Trump last week, to implore the president to call off the lethal injection killing.</p> <p>“Lisa’s experiences as a victim of horrific sexual violence, physical abuse, and being trafficked as a child do not excuse her crime,” <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/11lXp4IP2RKXhKp5vM4gDJ6CBKwyPCSXB/view"">they wrote</a>. “In this case, mental health professionals have concluded that the sexual violence and cruelty she suffered was directly related to the crime she committed.”</p> <p>A coalition of more than 800 organisations, scholars and survivors campaigning against all forms of violence against women have also written to Trump. They write: “Lisa committed her terrible crime – the seriousness of which we do not minimise – in the wake of a lifetime of victimisation and mental illness.</p> <p>“We urge you to have mercy and to commute her death sentence to life without the possibility of parole.”</p> <p>On Monday, however, the judge was skeptical.</p> <p>“I would think that any vigorous and experienced counsel … would begin on day one and would have done a great deal for early November to have at least started the process of putting something together,” Moss said.</p> <p>Sandra Babcock, an attorney for Montgomery, responded that lead clemency attorneys Henry and Harwell were too sick to meet the Monday night deadline to file Montgomery’s petition.</p> <p>“What I can tell you is that the amount of time was very short, given all that they had to do,” said Babcock, telling Moss later in the hearing that clemency arguments “can’t be put together by any old person”.</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed reporting.</em></p> <p>• This article was amended on 19 November 2020 to correct the spelling of Bobbie Jo Stinnett’s first name.",False,pillar/news,News,['gang-rape']

She’d had a difficult childhood, allegedly suffering sexual abuse from a family member. She’d been married at 16 but had left her husband. She had addiction issues. She’d had two children already and placed them for adoption. She was depressed. She was desperate for a safe and legal abortion. Texas, however, wouldn’t give her one. So she challenged the state laws and her case eventually went before the US supreme court, legalizing abortion across America.</p> <p>After becoming the poster girl of the pro-choice movement, McCorvey performed a very public about-face in the 1990s. She found religion, ended the romantic relationship with her girlfriend, and became a vocal anti-abortion crusader.</p> <p>As it turns out, it wasn’t God himself directing this new path. It was leaders from the evangelical Christian right. McCorvey, who died in 2017, delivers this confession in a new FX documentary, AKA Jane Roe, out on Friday. According to the documentary, McCorvey received at least $456,911 in “benevolent gifts” from the anti-abortion movement in exchange for her “conversion”.</p> <p>“I was the big fish,” McCorvey says in the documentary. “I think it was a mutual thing. I took their money and they’d put me out in front of the cameras and tell me what to say. It was all an act. I did it well, too. I am a good actress. Of course, I’m not acting now.”</p> <p>The <a href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/jane-roe-confesses-anti-abortion-conversion-all-an-act-paid-for-by-the-christian-right"">Rev Flip Benham</a>, one of the evangelical leaders featured in the documentary, apparently has no moral qualms about how McCorvey, who was clearly vulnerable, was used. “She chose to be used,” he says. “That’s called work. That’s what you’re paid to be doing!” Ah yes, I remember reading that in the Bible: thou shalt pay others to cravenly lie.</p> <p>The Rev Rob Schenck, another of the evangelical leaders featured, is rather more thoughtful. “For Christians like me, there is no more important or authoritative voice than Jesus,” he says. “And he said, ‘What does it profit in the end if he should gain the whole world and lose his soul?’ When you do what we did to Norma, you lose your soul.”</p> <p>Sadly, it seems as though many anti-abortion extremists don’t have much of a soul to lose in the first place. While the right claims to stand for morality and family values they – as AKA Jane Roe makes very clear – are more than happy to lie and cheat in order to propagate their fringe beliefs. As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez <a href=""https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1262803968087912448?s=20"">tweeted</a>: “It turns out a huge part of the anti-choice movement was a scam the entire time.” Most Americans have moderate views when it comes to abortion; according to a 2017 Pew study, <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/03/about-seven-in-ten-americans-oppose-overturning-roe-v-wade/"">69% of Americans don’t think Roe v Wade should be overturned</a>. However, a small but powerful group of extremists are doing everything they can to roll back women’s rights.</p> <p>Of course, McCorvey, as she admits herself, is not exactly an innocent victim in all this. Her reversal on reproductive rights was national news in the 1990s, and dealt a blow to the pro-choice movement. But, at the end of the day, McCorvey never really set out to be a pro-choice activist. She was a desperate woman battling for the right to have control of her own body; along the way she loaned her name to a bigger fight. McCorvey taking money to lie obviously isn’t something she should be applauded for, but the real villains in this story are the hypocrites who preyed on a vulnerable woman in the name of “family values”.</p> <ul> <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul",False,pillar/opinion,Opinion,['forced abortion']

The cause: a liberal sprinkling of liberal-baiting tasting notes from the pen of spirits writer Jim Murray, as published in the latest edition of his annual Whisky Bible. In an Instagram post, fellow whisky writer Becky Paskin took issue with the apparent sexism of Murray’s notes: Paskin found “34 references to whisky being ‘sexy’ and many more crudely comparing drinking whisky to having sex with women.” The descriptions of the whiskies made by Welsh distiller Penderyn were particularly distasteful. As Paskin pointed out, Penderyn has an all-female distilling and blending team. Given his power in the whisky industry, that gives Murray’s Swiss Tony-ish response to Penderyn Celt (“If this was a woman, I’d want to make love to it every night. And in the morning. And afternoon, if I could find the time… and energy…”) a distinctly creepy cast – not to mention an image that I’d rather not have in my head when I have a dram of this fine whisky.</p> <p><strong>Zuccardi Valles Torrontés, Salta, Argentina 2019 (from £13.99, <a href=""https://www.cambridgewine.com/"">cambridgewine.com</a>; <a href=""https://www.kingsgatewineswinchester.co.uk/"">kingsgatewineswinchester.co.uk</a>; <a href=""http://portlandwines.com/"">portlandwines.com</a>) </strong>Murray for his part has defended his corner stoutly, and, as is the depressing modern reactionary way, has invoked principles of free speech being imperilled by a miserably over-sensitive and humourless woke generation. Since his book is widely available, it would be hard to argue that such deathless phrases as “if whisky could be sexed this would be a woman” have not been freely and widely expressed. Still, let he without sin and all that, and the Murray furore has prompted me to ask if my own tasting notes are entirely free of the sort of casual sexism that Murray’s reveal. The wine trade as a whole is certainly guilty of a habit of describing wines in stereotypically gendered ways: lighter, perfumed, pretty wines are routinely described as feminine. Mea culpa: I’ve fallen into this language unthinkingly when describing such aromatically floral wines as Zuccardi’s beautifully balanced torrontés employing archaic imagery I’d never ordinarily use: boudoir, buxom, though thankfully not sexy. This time around I’ll simply say it’s a beautiful, spicy-food-friendly white.</p> <p><strong>Fonseca Unfiltered Late Bottled Vintage Port, Douro, Portugal 2014 (from £14.99, <a href=""https://www.robertsandspeight.co.uk/"">robertsandspeight.co.uk</a>; <a href=""https://www.frazierswine.co.uk/"">frazierswine.co.uk</a>; <a href=""https://www.cadmanfinewines.co.uk/"">cadmanfinewines.co.uk</a>; <a href=""https://noblegreenwines.co.uk/"">noblegreenwines.co.uk</a>) </strong>No prizes for guessing which types of wine get to be described as masculine: it’s the “powerful” wines that are high in alcohol, tough or “muscular” in tannin and strong in flavour. These vinous Marlboro men are generally red wines, or fortified wines such as port, although a red wine can apparently have a feminine and masculine side. Certainly, I’ve seen the ports of Fonseca, with their combination of silky texture, violet-edged fruits of the forest fruitiness, and deep concentration and intensity (qualities all very much present in the 2014 LBV) described as both feminine and masculine. Is this kind of thing offensive? To me it’s representative of the dated worldview of the milieu in which modern wine writing developed: a world dominated first by English upper-class men and then American ex-fratboys. As the wine-writing (and spirits-writing) world has become more inclusive, so the tics and mannerisms of the old school have come to seem ridiculous. Like a badly stored old bottle of claret, today they’re best left alone.</p> <p><em>Follow David Williams on Twitter <a href=""https://twitter.com/daveydaibach?lang=en"">@Daveydaibach</a></em",False,pillar/lifestyle,Lifestyle,['women killed over honor']

The aides were not named, but the spokesman confirmed they were not Dominic Cummings or Lee Cain, the PM’s former chief adviser and communications head respectively, who <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/nov/13/dominic-cummings-has-already-left-job-at-no-10-reports"">both left Downing Street</a> amid bitter infighting at the end of last week.</p> \n<p>In a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/nov/16/they-pinged-me-boris-johnson-told-to-self-isolate-by-nhs-test-and-trace-coronavirus-video"">video posted to Twitter</a>, Johnson said: “Hi folks, the good news is that NHS test and trace is working ever more efficiently, but the bad news is that they’ve pinged me and I’ve got to self-isolate because someone I was in contact with a few days ago has developed Covid.</p> \n<p>“It doesn’t matter that we were all doing social distancing, it doesn’t matter that I’m fit as a butcher’s dog, feel great – so many people do in my circumstances. And actually it doesn’t matter that I’ve had the disease and I’m bursting with antibodies. We’ve got to interrupt the spread of the disease and one of the ways we can do that now is by self-isolating for 14 days when contacted by test and trace.”</p> \n<p>Downing Street later confirmed that Johnson had had at least one antibody test for Covid. The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “The PM has had an antibody test. He had that following the serious level of infection that he had earlier in the year.” Asked whether he had received subsequent antibody tests, the spokesman said: “I don’t know when the most recent test was.”</p> \n<p>The five other Tory MPs who said they had been at the meeting and were now self-isolating are: Brendan Clarke-Smith (Bassetlaw), <a href=""https://twitter.com/MrAndy_Carter/status/1328271539721170946?s=20"">Andy Carter</a> (Warrington South), Lia Nici (Great Grimsby), Katherine Fletcher (South Ribble) and Chris Clarkson (Heywood and Middleton).</p> \n<p>Clarke-Smith and Carter <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/brendan4bassetlaw/posts/373451304102472"">posted</a> very similar <a href=""https://twitter.com/MrAndy_Carter/status/1326867153270792192"">photos</a> of themselves with Johnson to that taken with Anderson, appearing to be closer than 2 metres and not wearing face coverings.</p> \n<p>Separately, the former Conservative minister Maria Miller, who sat next to Anderson in the Commons on Wednesday, is also reportedly self-isolating.

It’s also the case that No 10 is a Covid-secure workplace,” he said. Asked to explain the small distance between Johnson and the MPs, the spokesman said this was in part because they were stood side by side, not face to face.</p> \n<p>Asked why the meeting was held in person, he said: “Meetings for work are possible and are taking place. The PM has been having a mix of meetings.”</p> \n<p>Johnson, who must isolate for 10 more days – the 14-day self-isolation period begins with the last contact with the infected person – has been working in his Downing Street office rather than staying inside his flat in the building.</p> \n<p>His spokesman said Johnson was able to reach the office via a garden, with no contact with staff, and that this had been cleared by medical advisers.</p> \n<p>The advice for Johnson to self-isolate comes at a difficult moment for the government. He is expected to continue to make public statements from inside No 10, including on the government’s green plans.

The BBC, for example, initially <a href=""https://twitter.com/ApsanaBegumMP/status/1350893885762007042?s=20"">tweeted</a>: “Talented but flawed Producer Phil Spector dies aged 81.” (It then deleted the tweet.)

CNN <a href=""https://twitter.com/TeneishaC/status/1350908458715983873?s=20"">tweeted</a>: “Grammy-winning music producer Phil Spector dies of natural causes,” before deleting and revising the headline. <a href=""https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1350898687459823617?s=20"">Reuters’ tweet</a> mentioned Spector’s murder conviction, but made it seem like an inconvenient afterthought: “Influential rock producer Phil Spector, who changed pop music and was convicted of killing actress Lana Clarkson, died at the age of 81.”</p> <p>Tweets and headlines don’t lend themselves to nuance; even with the best intentions, they can easily sound flippant or facile. However, the examples above aren’t just illustrations of poor phrasing. They’re a reflection of how <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/06/we-let-male-genius-excuse-bad-behaviour-but-what-about-the-loss-of-female-genius"">a man’s “genius” is often viewed as more important than a woman’s humanity</a>. <a href=""https://newrepublic.com/article/147463/sexism-genius-death-stephen-hawking"">Numerous studies</a> show that the idea of genius is gendered; one 2015 study found <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/3042773/americans-think-geniuses-are-men-inside-our-contradictory-attitudes-on-brilliance"">90% of Americans</a> believe geniuses tend to be men. And male genius is romanticised, used to excuse all manner of bad behaviour. We don’t hold geniuses to the same standards we hold mere mortals. They’re always “complicated” or “tortured”; they’re never just “bad”.</p> <p>I’m not disputing Spector’s work had an important impact on pop culture. However, the question we should all be asking ourselves is what part of his legacy matters most: the music or the murder? Does his career matter more than the life, and ambitions, he cut short?

But it is wrong to imply that the “politics and passions of the young” are some wondrous Damascene revelation felt only by millennials. In my youth, we were every bit as passionate. I went on my first anti-racism march 50 years ago. As a pale, male and now stale human being, I have had close friends from every ethnicity all my life, and so have most of the white people I know.</p> <p>And though our education on these issues may indeed have been what Olusoga condemns as “Wilberforce-centric”, it was nevertheless morally admirable and effective so that, even in the 1960s, most schoolchildren believed that slavery was an obscenity on a par with the Holocaust, that colonialism had a dubious legacy and that the empire was a jingoistic joke.<br><strong>Alan Clark<br></strong><em>London</em></p> <p>• Re the <a href=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/974507/20210331_-_CRED_Report_-_FINAL_-_Web_Accessible.pdf"">race report</a>, let’s not throw out the baby (ie a clutch of quite workable and progressive recommendations) when we ditch the rather unpalatable bathwater (ie the questionable, sometimes offensive, language and rationale).</p> <p>Clearly the centuries-long barbaric enslavement and trade in African people by European nations has its own nuanced story of resistance, rebellion, reinvention, resilience and reformation. But this can only be told alongside the honest and painful examination of industrial-scale kidnap, people trafficking, torture, terror, child abuse, brutalisation, rape and murder – and the legacy of all of that, economically, socially, culturally and institutionally, on the society (and disparities) we see today.<br><strong>Deryck Browne<br></strong><em>African Health Policy Network</em></p> <p>• David Olusoga is right to condemn the Sewell report’s ill-informed interpretation of decolonising the curriculum as the banning of white authors. Just as disturbing is the recommendation to adopt a UK-centric focus in school education. Having criticised “token expressions of Black achievement”, the report suggests an example that is so tokenistic it is almost laughable: a dictionary of “British” words of Indian origin. Teaching this without context reduces India and its people, languages and cultures to the status of exotic curiosities. A truly decolonised English language curriculum might look at the multiplicity of Englishes spoken in different parts of the UK and the world. It could examine how language has been used to exclude and to disempower. The Sewell report itself, with its denial of institutional racism, provides a prime example of this phenomenon. <br><strong>Rachel Stone and Sylvia Ashton<br></strong><em>Authors, An A-Z of Creative Teaching in Higher Education</em></p> <p>• Rather than trying to discard useful concepts such as “structural racism”, perhaps, given most of the cabinet got <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/25/two-thirds-of-boris-johnsons-cabinet-went-to-private-schools"">a leg up</a> from private education, they might consider the idea of “structural elitism” useful. Also, their disregard for ministerial codes and transparent procurement and recruitment practices could alert them to “structural cronyism”. And perhaps a combination of the two concepts could result in “structural incompetence”.<br><strong>Mark Holman-Lisney<br></strong><em>Tadley, Hampshire</em></p> <p>• The Sewell report, in its denials, confirms the existence of institutional racism.

Even though the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, is likely to veto a package of dozens of pending bills to curb voter access, Republicans <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/legislature-voting-legislation-michigan-voting-rights-ddca6e77fb60d3244545053a7a85fe93"">are already hinting </a>they will use a loophole to implement the measures anyway. They can take advantage of <a href=""https://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/Initia_Ref_Under_Consti_12-08_339399_7.pdf"">a quirk</a> in Michigan’s law allowing voters to send a bill to the legislature if just over 340,000 voters sign a petition asking them to take it up. These kinds of bills cannot be vetoed by the governor.<br><br>“This effort is particularly anti-democratic, not just in substance, but in procedure,” said the Michigan secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat who serves as the state’s top election official.</p> <p>The proposals include measures that are breathtakingly restrictive, even when held up in comparison to other measures states are considering. One bill bans Michigan’s secretary of state not only from mailing out absentee ballot applications to all voters, but also blocks her <a href=""https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2021-2022/billintroduced/Senate/pdf/2021-SIB-0310.pdf#page=7"">from even providing a link</a> on a state website to a mail-in ballot application. Another proposal does not allow voters to use absentee ballot drop boxes<a href=""http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(32zrkfrlpfxjwicuy0rkctma))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=2021-SB-0286""> after 5pm</a> the day before election day. A different measure would require voters to make <a href=""http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2021-2022/billintroduced/Senate/pdf/2021-SIB-0285.pdf"">a photocopy of their ID</a> and mail it in to vote by mail.</p> <p>The effort is being closely monitored in a state known for razor-thin elections and where Donald Trump and allies tried to overturn the result in 2020. Republicans are moving aggressively to put the new voting restrictions in place ahead of the 2022 elections, when there are races for governor, attorney general and secretary of state. Michigan also has several key swing congressional districts that will help determine who controls the US House of Representatives in Washington.</p> <p>The new restrictions are also urgent for Republicans because they are about to lose one of their most powerful advantages in the state legislature. A decade ago, Republicans manipulated the boundaries of electoral districts in such a way that virtually guaranteed they would hold a majority of seats. That manipulation, called gerrymandering, has allowed Republicans to control the legislature since 2011.</p> <p>But in 2018, voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure to strip lawmakers of their ability to draw districts, giving the power to an independent commission. With the commission set to draw new districts later this year, the new restrictions may be Republicans’ last-ditch attempt to distort voting rules to give them an edge in elections.</p> <p>“Everything from January 6 forward is about 2022 and ultimately 2024. I believe we should plan for and anticipate that the very forces that emerged in 2020 to try to undermine democracy will be back in full force, potentially stronger, in more positions of authority, to try again in 2024,” Benson said.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""1dd2bf2d96ceebdf4841d192d7cbb253cf3d317c""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/1dd2bf2d96ceebdf4841d192d7cbb253cf3d317c/0_180_5415_3249/1000.jpg"" alt=""People attend a protest for voting rights at the Michigan state capitol in Lansing on 13 April."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">People attend a protest for voting rights at the Michigan state capitol in Lansing on 13 April.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Jim West/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2018, Michigan voters <a href=""https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/michigan-voting-proposal-3-results/1885266002/"">overwhelmingly approved</a> a constitutional amendment to expand voting by mail in the state. Now Republicans, more powerful thanks to their manipulated districts, are seeking to undo those reforms, Benson said.</p> <p>“What you have here is legislators, elected through gerrymandered districts, using that power and those seats to reach out to a very small, small portion of Michigan registered voters and use them to justify overturning the will of millions of Michigan citizens who quite clearly want these policies in place and who quite clearly oppose the very policies that the Republicans are promoting,” she said.</p> <p>“It makes it harder for every person and it’s really only supported by 340,000 people,” said Nancy Wang, the executive director of Voters Not Politicians, a civic action group in Michigan that was behind the 2018 anti-gerrymandering effort. “It’s the tyranny of the minority, but in such extreme, it’s shocking.</p> <p>Critics say the proposed laws would put up nearly insurmountable barriers for some residents who are elderly, low-income, disabled or face other challenges. Rachel Rion, 87, lives in Westland, a suburb of Detroit, and has relied on mailing absentee ballots in recent elections.</p> <p>She said the law that would require a photocopy of her identification to be mailed in with her ballot presents a problem because she doesn’t drive, doesn’t understand the rule change and doesn’t know where to get a photocopy made or how to use a copy machine.</p> <p>She also gave the example of a friend who is battling cancer and who is too sick to get out of bed, let alone deal with photocopies.</p> <p>“How would she vote?” Rion asked. “I really hope they don’t push through those laws. It really would be hard for us.”</p> <p>Chris Swope, the city clerk responsible for overseeing elections in Lansing, the state capital, said there was “not much good” in the package of bills Republicans are proposing. Many voters who use drop boxes, he said, return their ballots on election day and the GOP proposal would take away that option entirely.</p> <p>The party has cited a lack of trust in elections as their motivation, but “the lack of confidence was caused by people lying because they lost and couldn’t face that”, he said. “I don’t think you overreact to that by making it harder for everyone to vote when you still had 30% of people who didn’t vote at all.”</p> <p>Republicans have repeatedly used the veto-dodging loophole in recent decades to circumvent opposition from Whitmer and the former GOP governor Rick Snyder. Since 1987, the anti-abortion group Right to Life has used it to push through initiatives to ban public funds from being used to pay for abortions for welfare recipients, require parental consent before a minor can get an abortion, define a legal birth and require women to purchase a health insurance rider for an abortion, dubbed “<a href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/13/michigans-abortion-rider-_n_4958517.html"">rape insurance</a>”.</p> <p>Republicans dealt a blow to unions when they used the procedure in 2016 to repeal the state’s prevailing wage law, and in the coming weeks it could be used to strip Whitmer of her emergency order powers used to lock down the state during the pandemic.</p> <p>The Republican party is likely to turn to an activist network developed and still in place from the emergency order initiative, and the state’s loose laws around dark money will allow donors to contribute without fear of blowback.</p> <p>“You need people who are highly motivated, have the ground game, and people who have money, and every indication is, boy, Republicans have those things there in spades,” said Bill Ballenger, a Michigan political analyst.</p> <p>However, the process isn’t foolproof, and Democrats say they plan to use every tool to derail the effort. A 2018 Right to Life <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/08/minority-rule-michigan-loophole-allows-activists-to-push-through-abortion-bans"">campaign</a> would have banned abortions after six weeks, but it failed when the secretary of state found a high number of invalid signatures. Meanwhile, the petition to strip Whitmer’s emergency orders <a href=""https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2021/04/petition-to-repeal-emergency-powers-had-forged-signatures-misleading-language-opposition-group-claims.html"">faces</a> a possible legal challenge.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""a3f3ab752fee620ccce83de787c26a6d300bec4b""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/a3f3ab752fee620ccce83de787c26a6d300bec4b/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg"" alt=""People chant ‘Stop the count’ outside the Detroit department of elections central counting board in Michigan on 4 November 2020."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">People chant ‘Stop the count’ outside the Detroit department of elections central counting board in Michigan on 4 November 2020.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Kent Nishimura/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If a voting restrictions package moves forward, Democrats would probably first mount a “decline to sign” campaign to drum up opposition during Republicans’ signature-collection process, said Mark Brewer, a state constitutional attorney and former head of the Michigan Democratic party. They would also challenge the signatures turned into the secretary of state, who has already voiced strong opposition to the proposed laws and could slow the process. “There will be a very concerted effort to ensure that any citizen who signs any potential effort like this knows exactly what they’re signing so we eliminate the opportunity for deception, which has been an issue in the past, repeatedly,” Benson said.</p> <p>Democrats could also challenge the laws’ constitutionality in the courts, and a counter ballot initiative is also possible, though the logistics are difficult in terms of timing and language. If both measures are approved, the Michigan supreme court, controlled by a 4-3 Democratic majority, decides which elements of each become law.</p> <p>As lawmakers across the country move hundreds of bills to restrict voter access, stopping the new Michigan restrictions would send a powerful message, Benson said.</p> <p>“If we can overcome this attack on our freedom to vote, and we have many pieces in place to do that, we can be a story of that as opposed to the Georgia story,” where the governor signed a package of restrictions into law in March. “The actions we take now will set the stage for what is attempted in the future.”",False,pillar/news,News,['forced abortion']

Nathan Harewood, 29, was sentenced to 31 years for his murder. Khalil Rehman, 27, and Francis Appiageyi, 28, were found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 13-and-a-half years each. All three were found guilty of aggravated burglary and unlawful wounding of David’s brother Taiye, 35. </p> <p>Bello-Monerville was the third of John and Linda’s children to be killed in separate incidents. Joseph Burke-Monerville, 19, was shot in 2013 in a case of mistaken identity. The couple’s eldest child, Trevor Monerville, was stabbed to death in 1994 aged 26. No one has been convicted of either killing.</p> <p>Linda was so overjoyed after the men’s sentences were announced that she called out to the judge, Wendy Joseph QC: “Merry Christmas and a happy new year.”</p> <p>She said that the family would now redouble its efforts to gain justice for their other two sons’ killings.</p> <p>Bello-Monerville, 38, had been at his home with his brother, Jonathan, 26, in East Barnet on the evening of 18 June 2019. Harewood, Rehman and Appiageyi travelled to the area, armed with two knives and a hammer, planning to rob him. When the two brothers left the flat to buy something from a shop the three men ransacked Bello-Monerville’s flat.</p> <p>In her sentencing remarks the judge said Bello-Monerville had three jobs including one as a barber but had fallen into debt and had begun to deal cannabis at his home. This news had reached the three men. There was at least £7,000 of cannabis and nearly £1,500 cash at Bello-Monerville’s home on the night of his murder.</p> <p>Police were called and Jonathan called another brother, Taiye, who was living nearby, to come and help.</p> <p>As David and his brothers waited outside for the police the three men ran out of the flat, intending to flee the scene. The brothers managed to restrain Rehman who called out for help from Harewood and Appiageyi. Harewood then stabbed David five times in the back. He died later in hospital.</p> <p>John and Linda Burke-Monerville previously told the Guardian the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/16/this-time-we-need-justice-parents-of-three-sons-killed-in-london-speak-out"">loss of three of their seven children</a> felt like “a terrible dream” and described their emotions as a “multiplicity of grief”.</p> <p>In February 2013, Joseph was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/16/police-plea-families-joseph-burke-monerville-murder"">killed</a> as he sat in a car in Hackney, east London, with his twin, Jonathan, and older brother David. Jonathan and David were injured in the shooting. A trial of three men suspected of his murder collapsed in 2015. A coroner ruled that Joseph had been unlawfully killed.</p> <p>After sentencing, Linda Burke-Monerville said: “Justice has been done for one of my sons … Our family has found new faith in the police. The police need to fish the killers of our other two sons in now. Those killers are living ghosts. They will never know peace until justice is done. Those two killings cannot go unpunished. Their consciences will be pricking them. They cannot hide forever.”</p> <p>In a statement read out in court earlier she said: “My son was a hard working man, he was a wonderful human being and a wonderful son. He looked after us all. I am truly broken. A mother cannot bury her son. During the trial David should have celebrated his fortieth birthday. It should have been a joyous occasion. My heart was ripped out just like that.”",False,pillar/news,News,['honor killing']

I can’t speak for everybody, but I know that guys were trying to text family just in case, you know? It was that kind of situation.”</p> <p>Conley said he felt something like an explosion when the plane hit the flock of birds and started to lose altitude. Some players and staff saw flames.</p> <p>“Everybody’s just quiet,” said Conley. “It took the pilots probably five to 10 minutes, probably about 10 minutes, to go through everything, go through their checks and get back to us and let us know what was going on. Because it was obvious that something was really wrong with the plane.</p> <p>“It felt like the plane was breaking apart in midair. For five or 10 minutes, it felt like complete helplessness. We’re thankful it wasn’t as serious as it could have been, but it was scary.”</p> <p>Jazz guard Jordan Clarkson praised the calm of the pilots during the incident, and said the team would support each other in the coming days.</p> <p>“It’s definitely something, an experience, that we’re happy to be able to tell,” Clarkson said. “A lot of us really came to a point ... at least 30 seconds in that flight, everybody came to the point where it was like, ‘Man, it might be over for us.’ It’s sad to say that. I don’t play with death or anything like that.</p> <p>“It’s just something that we’ve got to push through and come together and keep going, stay strong, support each other. How much time we’ve got to take off, or talking to our mental health people or whatever it is, that’s a serious situation if you’ve never been faced with life and death.”</p> <p>One player who may be particularly affected is two-time All Star Donovan Mitchell, who had spoken of his fear of flying even before Tuesday. He did not travel to Wednesday’s game due to “personal reasons”.

The job was relevant to Carter’s interests as a graduate student in the primate studies group at the University of Oklahoma, and could help pay for school. It was also mostly hands-off; the caretakers, psychologist Maurice Temerlin and his wife, Jane, relayed instructions via note left on the kitchen counter, save for one hard rule: no physical contact with Lucy, their 11-year-old chimp.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/14/primatologist-jane-goodall-tarzan-married-the-wrong-jane"">Primatologist Jane Goodall: ‘Tarzan married the wrong Jane’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lucy had other plans. The chimp, raised as the Temerlins’ “daughter” as a part of a foolhardy, 60s zeitgeist experiment on the limits of nature versus nurture, immediately challenged Carter’s ability to hold the boundary. “She was formidable,” Carter recalls in an expansive, disarming interview that forms the backbone of Lucy the Human Chimp, a new HBO Max documentary on the primate used as an idealistic science experiment and the caretaker who stood with her to extraordinary ends.</p> <p>A “very precise” signer with a 120-word vocabulary in American sign language, Lucy was “very arrogant, very condescending” about Carter’s inability to understand her. One day, Lucy motioned to Carter that she wanted to groom her. In a tense moment recreated in the film, Carter dropped the touch boundary. When Lucy asked for grooming in return, Carter reached her fingers through the chain-link cage. It was “a very special moment for me,” she recalls in the film, “and has nothing to do with theories of psychology or language or anything. It was our moment.”</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jL7u5BznRo""                                                                        >  <iframe height=""259"" width=""460"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3jL7u5BznRo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This foundational moment of intimacy anchors Lucy the Human Chimp, a deceptively moving, sensitive first-person account of an intense, unusual inter-species bond. The 79-minute film breezes from Carter’s weird college job to a story of tragically misguided idealism and, ultimately, a portrait of a singular friendship – a testament to loyalty and the fuzziness of boundaries between our closest animal cousins and ourselves.</p> <p>In 1977, the Temerlins decided Lucy, despite only having ever known humans, should live as a free chimpanzee in an African nature preserve. Carter accompanied the Temerlins to the Gambia on what was supposed to be a three-week trip to help Lucy adjust to her new home. She never went back; Lucy, extremely depressed by the upheaval and disappearance of her human parents, unable to forage and unwilling to ditch her human diet for leaves, needed her friend. Carter extended her trip by a couple of weeks, then a couple of months, then moved to an uninhabited island in the Gambia River with Lucy and two other chimps unable to survive in the wild without help. She stayed on the island, with her family of eventually 10 rehabilitated chimpanzees and without other humans, for over six years.</p> <p>“They got on as beings, and that’s clear,” the film’s director, Alex Parkinson, told the Guardian. “That’s the same as all the chimpanzees on the island – they all got on as one family. And it’s such an extraordinary thought that Janis is probably the only person who’s done this in the whole world.”</p> <p>Underlying this extraordinary bond was scientific idealism gone awry. The first third of the film replays, through the Temerlins’ home videos and archival news footage, Lucy’s mini-celebrity status as boundary-pushing experiment in the 1960s. She was born in 1964 in an American roadside zoo, and was taken from her sedated mother at two days old to be raised by the Temerlins as a test of natural instincts’ malleability, in line with the brash, pioneering exploits of the decade. At the time, the field of primatology was in vogue as an empirical – and photogenic – inquiry into questions of evolution and cognition. Pioneering primatologists such as Jane Goodall made headlines and inspired careers; primates with limited ability to communicate via sign language covered magazines. Lucy herself, once in the +</p> <p>36Gambia, was the subject of an episode of Mutual of Omaha’s Wild Kingdom, a Sunday primetime staple.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""2a0f60bf3a2e1795c55a218e557b8603ce074793""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/2a0f60bf3a2e1795c55a218e557b8603ce074793/0_129_1920_1152/1000.jpg"" alt=""Janis Carter and Lucy Temerlin"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">To no one’s surprise, Lucy’s captivity became increasingly untenable with age.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: HBO Max</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Temerlins’ experiment – raising Lucy as close to human as possible – was part of this “general exploration of what it means to be human, and what are the boundaries of our capabilities”, said Parkinson. “What is that dividing line between animal and human? On paper, back then, it makes kind of sense,” he said of Lucy’s adoption. “But obviously now, looking back on it with today’s lens, it’s completely wrong and immoral and doesn’t happen any more, and rightly so.”</p> <p>The early days were TV-special cutesy – excerpts of the Temerlins’ home videos collected in Lucy the Human Chimp show Lucy in a diaper, cuddling her parents, eating oatmeal with a spoon, traipsing about the living room. “We wondered how chimp she would turn out to be, or how human?” Maurice Temerlin’s journal entry reads in voiceover. The tragedy is barely concealed – to no one’s surprise, Lucy’s captivity became increasingly untenable with age. The “loving family home”, Jane Temerlin laments in voiceover, became “impossible for her to live in as an adult”. (Jane was interviewed remotely for the film; Maurice Temerlin died in 1988).</p> <p>Parkinson believes, however, that the Temerlins “best intentions are borne out by the fact of how they viewed Lucy as their daughter. They genuinely loved her as their daughter. And they tried to do right by her and put her life right subsequently.”</p> <p>“It took a lot of persuading for her to talk about it,” Parkinson said of a remote interview with Jane, as it’s “an extremely emotional subject” for both her and Carter. “I think it profoundly affected them in good and bad ways. And it’s a kind of thing they haven’t really absorbed, they haven’t really gone into great detail with it within themselves since it happened.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""b684b5575f8656be4eba11f50baa0f9ec9e127e0""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/b684b5575f8656be4eba11f50baa0f9ec9e127e0/0_270_1860_1116/1000.jpg"" alt=""Janis Carter, Lucy Temerlin from Lucy the Human Chimp"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Janis with Lucy: ‘I think it profoundly affected them in good and bad ways.’</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: HBO Max</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Temerlins and Carter wanted Lucy to be “independent, free, to have choice,” Carter recalls in the film, but it was tough, almost unfathomable going. The film’s final half dramatically recreates Carter’s time on the island (played by Lorna Nickson Brown), which she only left, by boat, every few weeks for supplies. (The reliance on dramatic recreations and Carter’s interview became necessary, according to Parkinson, once Covid lockdowns precluded further interviews with experts, academics and other figures in Carter’s life.) Carter had no camping and minimal outdoor experience; she once found a rat decomposing in the water supply she’d used for days. The chimps were dependent on her leadership for food and emotional support. Frightened and confused, they slept above her mosquito net canopy during the early months, fearfully defecating on her bed at the unfamiliar jungle sounds.</p> <p>The group adjusted, survived, melded as a family untethered from human measures of the passage of time. “I don’t know if I ever became a chimp, so to speak,” Carter says in the film. “But I do think that our personalities and our cultural tendencies all met together at some point and we were just who we were.” Carter only left when a male chimp, an offspring-like figure, attacked her as an assertion of primal dominance. She set up shop across the river, and later returned one more time to visit Lucy, who embraced her tightly, a moment captured in an iconic, tender photograph. Weeks later, a search party found Lucy’s scattered remains on the island, cause of death unknown.</p> <p>Carter stayed in the Gambia, working in chimpanzee rehabilitation as the island’s population bloomed to over 100 chimps. At the film’s close, she recalls the deep feeling of inner peace and interconnectedness that coursed through her years on the island, sacred moments recalled by the beauty of each sunset. “How often do you get a chance to live like that today?” she asks. Then, mirroring many a clip of Lucy, she covers her eyes with her hands.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lucy the Human Chimp is available on HBO Max in the US and on Channel 4 in the UK</p></li> </ul",False,pillar/arts,Arts,['woman+murder']

Hacked emails <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/20/missing-siberian-man-oligarchs-at-war-in-london"" title="""">revealed that the campaign</a> was in fact being orchestrated by people with close links to the Kremlin who had an ulterior motive: to trigger an investigation by the UK’s National Crime Agency into the London-based daughter and son-in-law of the mining magnate, Alexander Shchukin. Winning support for the investigation in Westminster was a key part of the plan.</p> <p>Now the son-in-law, Ildar Uzbekov, is demanding an apology from those who were sucked into the campaign, which he suspects has been waged on behalf of one of several Russian oligarchs vying for control of Shchukin’s prize asset – a highly profitable mine owned by his family trust in Cyprus.</p> <p>Uzbekov, whose wife, Elena, runs an art gallery in Mayfair, has chosen to go on the offensive after two men who knew Lazarevich and had no links to Shchukin or his family were last month charged with the murder. “I am writing to those parliamentarians and all those individuals who were associated with the campaign against me demanding an apology,” Uzbekov told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>It is a gambit that could potentially embarrass Westminster.

But the film was pulled before it was screened after Uzbekov sued for libel. In a darkly ironic example of life imitating art, a putative guest list for the premiere reveals that organisers had intended to invite the star of <em>McMafia</em>, James Norton, and the author of the book on which the BBC crime drama is based, Misha Glenny.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat peer Lord Razzall hosted a dinner in parliament at which a 31-page dossier reiterating the film’s central claims was distributed. And Tory peer Lord Bellingham wrote to the then security minister, Ben Wallace, raising concerns about alleged human rights abuses and money laundering after a talk from the campaign’s organisers.</p> <p>Using data protection legislation, Uzbekov applied for “subject access requests” against both Razzall and Bellingham to see what contact they may have had with the campaign, which his lawyers said was being waged maliciously “by certain persons of influence within the Russian Federation to damage his reputation and cause him serious harm”. Both peers said that they had never discussed Uzbekov and were interested only in securing justice for Lazarevich’s family and encouraging cooperation with Russian prosecutors.</p> <p>“It has now emerged that the person who was alleged to have been disappeared by my father-in-law was actually murdered in a parochial dispute between neighbouring gangs in Russia,” Uzbekov said. “Those who have launched and participated in the campaign ought to have known that. We deserve to have our name cleared and all investigations by parliamentarians – and other British institutions – should be called off immediately and an apology issued.”</p> <p>Since the campaign against him began, Uzbekov has had his British bank accounts closed and has had to travel with an extensive security detail.

Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “When everybody comes back from mixing over Christmas, we anticipate that most of our bubbles will be under pressure. So you’ll probably be testing most of the school community when we come back in that first and second week. You are going to need huge numbers of staff, and they’re bringing this in with no resources at all. It’s just so ill thought through.”</p> <p>Sam Henson, director of policy and information at the National Governance Association, warned that headteachers could end up working on Christmas Day to put plans in place. He told the BBC that the plans put a “huge degree of pressure” on school leaders: “We’ve ended up in a situation where the public are led to believe schools have been told they have to do this and they’re being resourced to do this. We need to get the facts clear.”</p> <p>The Department for Education said that it knew the task of mass testing was challenging, and thanked school staff for their efforts to deliver it.</p> <p>Meanwhile, new data obtained by the <em>Observer</em> shows students in their final year of GCSEs have been unable to attend school every day this academic year in two-thirds of English state schools, with pupils in deprived areas hit the hardest. A school attendance gap is opening up between the richest and poorest students due to the pandemic, the survey of more than 4,300 secondary school teachers suggests.</p> <p>While at most private schools (51%) no year 11 students has been forced to self-isolate and miss school this year, the same can only be said for year 11 pupils at 33% of state schools.</p> <p>The data shows GCSE pupils attending schools in deprived areas of the country are the most likely to have been forced to take time off: 57% of teachers at schools in the most deprived areas said that, at some point this term, they have had to either send the whole of year 11 home or close at least one year 11 class or “bubble”. Only a third of teachers working in private schools reported needing to take such measures.</p> <p>The survey, by survey website TeacherTapp, also found regional differences in the amount of schooling that GCSE students have been missing. Just one in five teachers in the north-west have taught all of their year 11 pupils face-to-face every day since September, compared with about half of teachers in the south-west and the east of England.</p> <p>Co-founder of TeacherTapp, Laura McInerney, said it would be ridiculous to think these differences would not have an effect on outcomes for pupils. For example, she said, in about 40% of schools in the north-west of England, the entire GCSE year group had had to isolate at home at some point over the past term.</p> <p>“Compare this to private schools, where only 20% of schools have isolated all their GCSE students, and it adds up to a significant difference in disruption and teaching time suffered by different pupils. Given that private schools more speedily shifted their curriculum online during the spring lockdown, due to having better access to technology, state school pupils are really going to have their work cut out for them to catch up.”",False,pillar/news,News,"['forced marriage', 'forced abortion']"

So a real onus exists on the media to act sensitively.”</p> <p>In the survey, 93% of families said they did not understand how to make an official complaint about the press. In one case, a national newspaper door-stepped a teenage family member when no adults were at home. “He was petrified my sister’s killer would come for him.

Further excavation revealed evidence of a big party, including large ovens and other traces of feasts and celebration.</p> <p>“The offerings likely were part of much larger feasts and gatherings, sponsored by the state,” said Valdez. “The state befriended the local people with food and drink, cementing political alliances, whilst placing offerings allowed the Inca to claim the land as theirs.”</p> <p>Excavation at Tambo Viejo started in 2018 and has found a large plaza, an Inca <em>ushnu </em>(a symbolic or religious structure), and that an important road from the Nazca Valley stopped at the settlement.</p> <p>When the conquistadors arrived in the Inca empire, they observed that the native people worshipped a variety of deities that were said to govern aspects of life including the sun, rain and rivers. </p> <p>Although human sacrifice was part of appeasing these deities, llamas were the preferred offering. Bernabé Cobo, a colonial-period Spanish chronicler, wrote that brown llamas were sacrificed to the creator god, Viracocha, and white llamas to the sun.</p> <p>The rituals would happen at key times of the year: in October, 100 llamas would be sacrificed to promote rain, and in February another 100 were sacrificed to stop it.</p> <p>The Tambo Viejo discovery, published in the journal Antiquity<em>, </em>gives new insight into the rituals. The llamas were decorated with valuable bracelets and string and buried alive alongside decorated guinea pigs. Their graves were marked with tropical feathers, perhaps to further cement the Incas’ new authority over the land.</p> <p>The archaeologists wrote in their research: “Through these ceremonies, the Inca created new orders, new understandings and meanings that helped to legitimise and justify their actions to both the conquerors and the conquered.”",False,pillar/news,News,['honor killing']

If respected and treated as equals, they have the potential to transform the continent’s security and prosperity. This matters because every penny invested in girls’ education, healthcare and social protection benefits society many times over, while failure to invest in girls results in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jun/28/child-marriage-cost-4tn-by-2030-researchers-warn-world-bank-icrw"">monumental socioeconomic losses</a>.</p> <p>Child marriage alone has resulted in human capital and revenue losses equivalent to three times the entire flow of international aid into the continent.

As if that were not enough, the Covid-19 pandemic has <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/sep/07/why-covid-school-closures-are-making-girls-marry-early"">exacerbated</a> the abuse, violence and exploitation suffered by millions of African girls.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/nov/21/african-governments-failing-girls-on-equality-report-finds"">African governments failing girls on equality, report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there is cause for optimism. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the <a href=""https://www.un.org/en/africa/osaa/pdf/au/afr_charter_rights_welfare_child_africa_1990.pdf"">African charter on the rights and welfare of the child</a>, a ground-breaking regional treaty that has strong support across the continent. Only six of the 55 African Union member states have yet to ratify the charter, and many of its provisions have been adopted into the domestic laws of African nations. There has been progress on a wide range of indicators – infant mortality, child malnutrition, female genital mutilation and child marriage rates have all fallen in the past three decades. Measles immunisation, birth registration and secondary school enrolment (for both boys and girls) have all risen.</p> <p>The African Child Policy Forum’s Girl-Friendliness Index measures the progress of 52 African governments towards realising the rights of girls. Mauritius, Tunisia, South Africa, Seychelles, Algeria, Cape Verde and Namibia all score relatively highly for having advanced the rights of their girls and rank in the “most girl-friendly” category. However, it is no surprise that countries with the highest levels of poverty, conflict and political instability, such as South Sudan, Chad, Eritrea, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Niger, Central African Republic and Comoros, have the lowest scores and are thus rated “least girl-friendly”.</p> <p>It is significant that some underresourced African countries – including Lesotho and Gabon – performed reasonably well, while others with a relatively high GDP – such as Equatorial Guinea and Botswana – were ranked lower. This suggests that political will and accountability are just as important as increasing budgets for girls’ programmes.</p> <p>We urgently have to break the cycle of gender-based discrimination and inequality. Girls are key drivers of transformation, and investing in them will trigger a chain reaction that ultimately leads towards a peaceful and prosperous Africa. To achieve this, governments must take urgent action on a number of fronts, starting with passing girl-friendly laws and repealing discriminatory ones. Investment in education should rise to at least 4% of GDP, in health to at least 15% and social protection to 6.4%, in line with International Labour Organization recommendations. This must go hand in hand with increased government commitment to eliminating violence against girls and giving them the space to voice their opinions.</p> <p>The fact that some African governments have made advancements towards realising girls’ rights and improving their wellbeing proves that given the political will, advances are possible. I applaud those countries that have risen to the top of the table and urge others to follow their example. But to the many who are shirking their responsibility to transform Africa into a continent where girls feel safe, respected and valued, we can no longer tolerate what is entirely unacceptable. Things must change, and they must change quickly.</p> <p>• Graça Machel is chair of the International Board of Trustees, African Child Policy Forum (ACPF)",False,pillar/news,News,['gender-based violence']

In the final months of last season, Taylor Townsend announced she is pregnant and will give birth in March.</p> <p>Some female players who are mothers would rather their tennis was front and centre in their profession and so her case is to be noted simply because it is a clear reflection of a recent cultural change in women’s tennis. In short, motherhood is becoming a normal career option in the sport for those who wish to take it.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jan/06/is-this-still-the-first-set-rustiness-and-heat-test-women-in-abu-dhabi"">\'Is this still the first set?\' Abu Dhabi heat tests WTA\'s tennis stars on return</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I think that 15 years ago if you were pregnant and you had a kid, it was over,” says Townsend. “The whole dynamic has just changed and I think the sport has evolved and realised that this is part of a woman’s life. This is part of what comes with being a woman. Women get pregnant, they have kids, but it doesn’t stop what you’re doing. And it doesn’t stop the path that you want to be on.”</p> <p>When Townsend announced the news in October, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tv/CGUo8dSgVgR/?igshid=1fscnyxx8o81r"" title="""">she did so in style</a>. In a social media video the American described in chronological order some of the many instances where people have doubted her with their toxic words and insisted she will not be perturbed by her next challenge. Her first example was most shocking: at only four years old she was told to quit tennis. “I was told ‘you’re too fat’, ‘you can’t move’, ‘you need to stop’, ‘she’s not going to make it’, ‘she’s too big’. I got all of that kind of dumb shit. That’s what I’ve heard since I started playing.”</p> <p>This has been a constant theme in Townsend’s career, particularly since 2012 when, despite being junior world No 1, the United States Tennis Association asked her to withdraw from the junior US Open claiming her fitness was insufficient. Even at the US Open last year, while she was pregnant, the comments endured. “I stopped listening to that and was like: ‘I need to be happy with who I am. I have to be OK with me,’” she says. “You’re never gonna look like them, that’s fine. But that’s not stopping me from going out and whooping ass. Whatever the thing that you say is holding me back, I can use that as a way to propel me to move forward.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""5db94b9642b69dd98b1369e73643b0fcd1b7102f""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/5db94b9642b69dd98b1369e73643b0fcd1b7102f/0_236_5472_3283/1000.jpg"" alt=""Taylor Townsend celebrates her victory against Simona Halep at the 2019 US Open."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Taylor Townsend celebrates her victory against Simona Halep at the 2019 US Open.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Tim Clayton/Corbis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The obstacles Townsend has faced have only toughened her skin and fuelled her drive. “I’m in a cool space because the things I went through as a kid, starting out, I will never allow that to happen to my child. It has given me an opportunity to learn from the things I went through and to be able to shape and change the path for my child. Because I’ll fight someone if they try to tell my four-year-old that they can’t do something. It’s just insane. Those types of people won’t be around.”</p> <p>Townsend recently revealed she is in a financial dispute with her mother over endorsement funds and says this has had a significant effect on how she carries herself. Her circle is smaller. She is not prepared to trust without being certain it will be reciprocated with trustworthiness. “I’ve gone through a sifting-out process and really got rid of all the garbage. Now I’m in the place that I’m pregnant, I’m having a kid, I’m not playing right now.

At a time when most players spend their time running away from the net, it was perhaps the greatest net-rushing performance of this generation. She approached the net more than 100 times; in the final set she essentially attempted to serve and volley on every first and second serve.</p> <p>She describes the moment as a “pivotal point” in her career that gave her the confidence to know she really can beat top players.

Rejecting conventional narrative structures, its story takes some decoding, and may well defy comprehension, but its striking visual language, with vibrant colours, sparse compositions and free-associative editing, casts quite a spell.</p> <p>Our protagonist is a bearded, long-haired young vagrant named Pinky (Luis Felipe Lozano), whom we first find shooting a man, stealing a motorbike, then getting high in an abandoned warehouse. It transpires he has recently left a cult and has killed its leader. We never see the cult in question, but in voiceover we learn of the hold its leader had on Pinky and other outcasts: “We had been miraculously saved from a world that had always seen us as worthless.” </p> <p>Fragments of Pinky’s experience are presented with little distinction between real and imagined. He spends time at a counterfeit T-shirt printing workshop. He recounts the tale of a beggar addict who believes they’re in a parallel world underground. He strips copper wire from buildings. He has a bewildering encounter with a man (who may be an incarnation of the cult leader) in a forest, where it is unclear who is going to kill whom.</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBeXZ0x6g4w""                                                                        >  <iframe height=""259"" width=""460"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XBeXZ0x6g4w?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There are echoes here of Chilean auteur Alejandro Jodorowsky in the disorienting stew of metaphor and mysticism, and the sheer logic-defying strangeness of it all.

As new insights tumbled in, Morrison apparently knew nothing about an alleged rape in the ministerial wing, while a number of people in close proximity to him knew everything.

Many women suppressed a sigh and rolled their eyes.</p> <p>While he was still battling Higgins, the second tsunami rolled in – the inexpressibly sad story of a woman and a (categorically denied) allegation of rape from 30 years ago levelled at the first law officer of the land; a dead woman speaking through an <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/mar/01/she-was-a-very-credible-person-says-friend-of-woman-who-claims-minister-raped-her-in-1988"">unsworn statement and the ardent testimony of her friends</a>, testimony the prime minister didn’t read before forwarding to the Australian federal police (who don’t deal with rape allegations committed in state jurisdictions).</p> <p>A lot of women I know aren’t watching current events obsessively because they want to know all the details, all the minutiae.</p> <p>They are watching for one purpose.</p> <p>They want to know if anything can, or will, change.</p> <p>They want to know if this government is prepared to make things better.</p> <p>If that’s the test, and for many people it is, then the government gives every appearance at the moment of failing it.</p> <p>Morrison and most of the people around him can’t seem to get the tone right.

It was 26 September 1976, the day after his birthday. He remembers the shootout, the bright flashes of gunfire and the sight of his father lying on the ground, mortally wounded, outside their home in a suburb of Buenos Aires, Argentina, with his mother lying beside him. Then Larrabeiti remembers being taken away by armed police, along with his 18-month-old sister, Victoria Eva.</p> <p>The two children became prisoners. At first, they were held in a grimy car repair garage that had been turned into a clandestine torture centre. That was in another part of Buenos Aires, the city that their parents had moved to in June 1973, joining thousands of leftwing militants and former guerrillas fleeing a military coup in their native Uruguay. The following month, in October 1976, Anatole and Victoria Eva were taken to Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, and held at the military intelligence headquarters. A few days before Christmas, they were flown to a third country, Chile, in a small aircraft that climbed high above the Andes. Larrabeiti remembers looking down on snowy peaks from the plane.</p> <p>Young children do not usually make epic journeys through three countries in as many months without parents or relatives. The closest thing they had to family was a jailer known as Aunt Mónica. It was probably Aunt Mónica who abandoned them in a large square, the Plaza O’Higgins, in the Chilean port city of Valparaíso, on 22 December 1976. Witnesses recall two young, well-dressed children stepping out of a black car with tinted windows. Larrabeiti wandered around the square, hand-in-hand with his sister, until the owner of a merry-go-round ride spotted them. He invited them to sit on the ride, expecting some panicked parents to appear, looking for their lost children. But nobody came, so he called the local police.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/sep/18/operation-condor-the-cold-war-conspiracy-that-terrorised-south-america-podcast"">Operation Condor: the cold war conspiracy that terrorised South America – podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No one could understand how the two children, whose accents marked them as foreign, had got here. It was as if they had dropped from the sky. Anatole was too young to make sense of what had happened. How does a four-year-old who finds himself in Chile explain that he does not know where he is, that he lives in Argentina, but is really Uruguayan? All he knew was that he was in a strange place, where people spoke his language in a different way.</p> <p>The next day, the children were taken to an orphanage, and from there they were sent on to separate foster homes. After a few months, they had a stroke of luck. A dental surgeon and his wife wanted to adopt, and when the magistrate in charge of the children asked the surgeon which sibling he wanted, he said both. “He said that we had to come together, because we were brother and sister,” Larrabeiti told me when we met earlier this year in Chile’s capital, Santiago.</p> <p>Today, he is a trim, smartly suited 47-year-old public prosecutor with hazel eyes and a shaven head. “I have decided to live without hate,” he said. “But I want people to know.”</p> <p>What Larrabeiti wants people to know is that his family were victims of one of the 20th century’s most sinister international state terror networks. It was called Operation Condor, after the broad-winged vulture that soars above the Andes, and it joined eight South American military dictatorships – Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Bolivia, Paraguay, Brazil, Peru and Ecuador – into a single network that covered four-fifths of the continent.</p> <p>It has taken decades to fully expose this system, which enabled governments to send death squads on to each other’s territory to kidnap, murder and torture enemies – real or suspected – among their emigrant and exile communities. Condor effectively integrated and expanded the state terror unleashed across South America during the cold war, after successive rightwing military coups, often encouraged by the US, erased democracy across the continent. Condor was the most complex and sophisticated element of a broad phenomenon in which tens of thousands of people across South America were murdered or disappeared by military governments in the 1970s and 80s.</p> <p>Most Condor victims disappeared for ever. Hundreds were secretly disposed of – some of them tossed into the sea from planes or helicopters after being tied up, shackled to concrete blocks or drugged so that they could barely move. Larrabeiti’s mother, Victoria, who was last seen in an Argentinian torture centre in 1976, is one of them. His father, Mario, who was a leftwing militant, probably died in the shootout when they were snatched by the police. Enough victims have survived, however, to tell stories that, when matched against a growing volume of declassified documents, amount to a single, ghastly tale.</p> <p>In the past two decades, Larrabeiti’s story has been told and retold in half a dozen courts and tribunals around the world. In the absence of a fully formed global criminal justice system, the perpetrators of Condor are being taken to court through a piecemeal process. “The trouble with borders is that it is easier to cross them to kill someone than it is to pursue a crime,” says Carlos Castresana, a prosecutor who has pursued Condor cases and the dictators behind them in Spain. Those seeking justice have had to rely on a judicial spider’s web of national laws, international treaties and rulings by human rights tribunals. The individuals they pursue are often decrepit and unrepentant old men, but a tenacious network of survivors, lawyers, investigators and academics, rather like the postwar <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/aug/31/the-last-nazi-hunters"" title="""">Nazi-hunters</a>, has taken up the challenge of ensuring that such international state terror does not go untried.</p> <p>The process is painfully slow. The first major criminal investigation focusing on Condor – with victims and defendants from seven countries – began in Rome more than 20 years ago. It still has not ended. On a sweltering day in July 2019, a judge in the Rome case <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/08/italian-court-jails-24-over-south-american-operation-condor"" title="""">handed life sentences</a> to a former president of Peru, a Uruguayan foreign minister, a Chilean military intelligence chief and 21 others for their role in a coordinated campaign of extermination and torture. The defendants are appealing, and a final verdict is due within a year.</p> <p>Much of what we now know about Condor has been unearthed or pieced together in Rome, Buenos Aires and in dozens of court cases – large and small – in other countries. Further evidence comes from US intelligence papers dealing with Argentina that were declassified on the orders of Barack Obama. In 2019, the US completed its <a href=""https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/argentina-dirty-wars/"" title="""">handover</a> of 47,000 pages to Argentina. These documents show how much the US and European governments knew about what was happening across South America, and how little they cared.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>When he was seven, Anatole Larrabeiti discovered his true identity, thanks to his tenacious paternal grandmother, Angélica, who tracked the siblings down. Stories had appeared in the Chilean press when they vanished in 1976, though headlines claimed they were abandoned by unidentified “red terrorist parents”. Over the next few years, word of the missing children’s whereabouts spread from one humanitarian organisation to another, before eventually reaching the Brazilian human rights group Clamor, which had activists in Valparaíso, the city in Chile where Larrabeiti and his sister were living. After a tipoff, the activists secretly photographed the children on their way to school and sent pictures to Angélica. She immediately recognised her grandchildren. “My sister was a replica of my mother as a child,” explained Larrabeiti. “And I have her lips.”</p> <p>By agreement with their biological grandparents, the children remained with their adopted parents in Chile. When Victoria Eva turned nine, she was told about her true identity, and the children started to make family visits to Uruguay. “They were good parents,” said Larrabeiti, of the couple who adopted them. “They kept the links with Uruguay and we had psychological support, which I needed when I became a very angry adolescent.”</p> <p>The crimes committed by Latin America’s military regimes during the cold war continue to haunt the continent. Only a perverse combination of power and paranoia can explain why these regimes awarded themselves the right not just to murder and torture, but also to steal children such as the Larrabeitis. The men perpetrating such crimes saw themselves as warriors in a messianic, frontierless war against the spread of armed revolution across Latin America.</p> <p>Their fantasies were overblown, but not entirely baseless. In 1965, the Argentinian revolutionary Ernesto “Che” Guevara had waved an emotional goodbye to his comrade-in-arms Fidel Castro, leaving Cuba. He vowed to initiate a new phase of revolutionary activity, extending guerrilla warfare across Latin America. Che was killed while carrying out his mission in Bolivia in 1967, but the US by then viewed revolution in Latin America as an existential threat – recalling how Russian nuclear weapons had reached Cuban soil during the 1962 missile crisis. In a bid to strengthen anti-communist forces, the US pumped money and weapons to armed forces across the region, vastly increasing the power of the military within these states and eventually, as the American journalist John Dinges has written, ending up in an “intimate embrace with mass murderers running torture camps, body dumps, and crematoriums”. In the 70s, as rightwing military coups and state terror swept the continent, an attempt at coordinating an armed response was made via a loose network known as the Revolutionary Coordinating Junta (JCR). Formed by groups from Chile, Uruguay, Argentina and Bolivia in 1973, the JCR had grandiose plans to pursue Che’s continental uprising, but lacked funds, friends and firepower. Meanwhile, South America’s military regimes began to collaborate more closely, initially striking bilateral agreements that allowed operatives to carry out their work on foreign soil.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""34428f1a0808327c74b857d3dd07a0bad31073c5""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/34428f1a0808327c74b857d3dd07a0bad31073c5/0_0_2048_1462/1000.jpg"" alt=""Argentine special forces in operation in Buenos Aires in 1982."" width=""1000"" height=""714"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Argentine special forces in operation in Buenos Aires in 1982.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Daniel García/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aurora Meloni, a Uruguayan who had gone into exile in Argentina with her husband, Daniel Banfi, and two young daughters, was one of the first to suspect that South America’s violent right was plotting an international network of terror and rendition. At 3am on 13 September 1974, Meloni and Banfi were at home in a suburb of Buenos Aires when about half a dozen armed men burst through their door. Meloni, then aged 23, immediately recognised one of them as the notorious Uruguayan police inspector Hugo Campos Hermida. Back in Uruguay, Hermida had once questioned Meloni and Banfi – then students of literature and history respectively – after they had taken part in a demonstration back home in support of the leftwing Tupamaro guerrilla movement, to which Banfi belonged. “I remembered how he [Hermida] had hit me,” Meloni told me. “He was very aggressive.”</p> <p>Meloni could not understand why Hermida was working freely in a foreign country. At that time, Argentina was still a democracy, with rule of law. (The military takeover came later, in March 1976.) Foreign policemen had no right to act there. After their apartment had been ransacked for clues as to the whereabouts of other exiled Tupamaros, Hermida took Banfi away. Aurora assumed she would soon discover which police station or jail he had been taken to, but there was silence.</p> <p>In September 1974, this was still a bizarre event. “We had never heard of people disappearing in Argentina before. I was sure I would find him,” Meloni told me. Eventually she called a press conference. How could someone vanish like that? The answer came five weeks later, when three bodies bearing torture scars were discovered by police 75 miles away. Car headlights and a group of men had been seen in a remote spot at night, and pile of fresh earth had been left behind. Daniel Banfi was one of three murdered Uruguayans found in the hastily dug grave.</p> <p>The following month, Meloni left Argentina, and eventually moved to Italy, where, since her father was Italian, she had dual nationality. She returned to Uruguay for three spells over the next 25 years, seeking justice. But, just as in Chile and Argentina, the price of ending dictatorship in Uruguay in 1985 was an amnesty, which ruled that state representatives could not be charged with crimes committed during the regime’s 12 years in power. It seemed nothing could be done.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>It wasn’t until the end of the century that cracks in the legal status quo began to appear. In the late 90s, a Spanish judge named Baltasar Garzón began testing a previously ignored law that obliged Spain to pursue any alleged human rights abusers anywhere in the world, if their own countries refused to try them. Garzón and a group of progressive prosecutors opened investigations for genocide and terrorism against Argentina’s former military junta and Pinochet’s regime, and “a criminal conspiracy” between them.</p> <p>Since the accused did not live in Spain, Garzón’s quest was viewed as quixotic. “People laughed at us,” the Spanish prosecutor who brought these cases, Carlos Castresana, told me in Madrid recently. On 16 October 1998, however, Pinochet was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/1998/oct/18/pinochet.chile"" title="""">arrested</a> by police at a London clinic after a minor hernia operation. He was a frequent visitor to the city, taking tea at Fortnum &amp; Mason and popping in on his old friend and ally Margaret Thatcher.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""3eb26f133549804b525402f499b02c277b43dea1""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/3eb26f133549804b525402f499b02c277b43dea1/0_0_1571_1650/952.jpg"" alt=""Augusto Pinochet after his arrest in London in 1998."" width=""952"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Augusto Pinochet after his arrest in London in 1998.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Amid the headlines and the flurry of paperwork sent to London over the following days, few people noticed that the initial warrant for Pinochet’s arrest was based on a Condor case. It named a Chilean victim who disappeared in Argentina, Edgardo Enríquez, and stated that “there is evidence of a coordinated plan, known as Operation Condor, in which several countries took part”.</p> <p>Pinochet was held for 17 months while Britain’s law lords twice approved extradition to Spain. Labour party home secretary Jack Straw stymied the extradition, instead sending Pinochet home to Chile on health grounds. On his return, the former dictator made a mockery of that justification by stepping out of his wheelchair to wave joyfully at supporters. Yet something major had changed, as prosecutors, judges and activists realised that South America’s dictators and their henchmen were no longer untouchable.</p> <p>In 1999, inspired by Garzón, Aurora Meloni brought a murder case in Italy against Uruguayan security officials who were suspected of killing Banfi and others. Families of other Condor victims with Italian citizenship joined Meloni, and the case broadened to cover Condor crimes in several countries. From her home in Milan, Meloni – now aged 69 – has kept the case alive ever since. “It has taken a long time,” she told me. After last year’s sentencing in Rome, the plaintiffs were delighted, but Meloni points out that until we know the outcome of the appeals, the story isn’t over.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>When Daniel Banfi was murdered in late 1974, Condor did not yet formally exist. His death can be seen as a precursor, or trial run. Hermida Campos was one of a handful of Uruguayan security officials who were secretly testing ways of hunting down exiles with their Argentinian counterparts.</p> <p>Another of those preparing the rendition programme with Argentina, which would later be absorbed into Condor, was the Uruguayan navy lieutenant Jorge Tróccoli. Now a grey, jowly 73-year-old, Tróccoli was the only defendant present at the Rome trial. He had moved to Italy and was arrested in Salerno, near Naples, in 2007. In the 90s, Tróccoli wrote two semi-autobiographical novels about how Uruguay’s military had embraced torture, murder and repression. In <em>La Hora del Depredador</em> (The Predator’s Hour), a torturer who appears to act as a proxy for the author (though Tróccoli insists this is fiction) declares: “When this is over, we will have to make peace. And that won’t happen if we use methods like this … What’s more, you will begin to feel bad about it as the years go by.” Yet, in court, Tróccoli showed no remorse, claiming innocence. “He sat beside me one day,” Meloni told me. “He was angry, not ashamed.”</p> <p>Most of what we know about Operation Condor only emerged years after it was over. Formal coordinating offices existed in several countries, and the network generated considerable paperwork as documents and encrypted cables were sent back and forth over a dedicated communications network called Condortel. But at the time the victims did not understand the scale of the international conspiracy.</p> <p>For more than a decade, public knowledge of Operation Condor was largely limited to an obscure FBI note quoted in a book, published in 1980, by John Dinges and fellow journalist Saul Landau. They were investigating the murders of a former Chilean ambassador and his American assistant, who were killed in Washington DC in 1976 by Pinochet’s agents. In a cable sent shortly after the killings, an FBI officer wrote: “Operation Condor is the code name for the collection, exchange and storage of intelligence data concerning leftists, communists and Marxists which was recently established between the cooperating services in South America.” The note went on to mention “a more secret phase” of Condor, which “involves the formation of special teams from member countries who are to travel anywhere in the world to carry out sanctions, [including] assassinations”.</p> <p>Beyond that, relatively little was known. It was in Paraguay where the first major breakthrough took place. In 1992, a young magistrate, José Agustín Fernández, received a tipoff on the whereabouts of the secret police archive of the country’s former strongman Gen Alfredo Stroessner, who grabbed power in 1954 and stayed until 1989. At dawn, three days before Christmas, Fernández made a surprise visit to a police station outside the capital city, Asunción. With a caravan of television cameras as company, but armed only with a warrant signed in his own hand, the magistrate forced Paraguay’s once-untouchable police to hand over the documents. “The journalists had to lend us a truck to take it all back to the court house,” Fernández told me. “Perhaps the most shocking thing were the photographs. They included people who were disappeared by Condor.”</p> <p>Fernández’s haul became known as the Archive of Terror. Here, buried among half a million sheets of paper detailing three decades of domestic repression under Stroessner, was the story of how Operation Condor was created, and by whom. It was not what Fernández had originally sought, and he was shocked. “We had heard the stories about it, but here was written proof,” he told me.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""c89e1a970116ba3097bd36002ce80609fe1bbe24""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/c89e1a970116ba3097bd36002ce80609fe1bbe24/0_0_4464_3383/1000.jpg"" alt=""The “Archives of Terror”, papers relating to Operation Condor, seized in Paraguay in 1992."" width=""1000"" height=""758"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The “Archives of Terror”, papers relating to Operation Condor, seized in Paraguay in 1992.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Norberto Duarte/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The documents established that Condor was formally created in November 1975, when Pinochet’s spy chief, Manuel Contreras, invited 50 intelligence officers from Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil to the Army War Academy on La Alameda, Santiago’s central avenue. Pinochet welcomed them in person. “Subversion has developed a leadership structure that is intercontinental, continental, regional and sub-regional,” Contreras told them, referring to organised resistance from opponents of the continent’s military regimes. He proposed a sophisticated network linked by “telex, microfilm, computers, cryptography” to track down and eliminate enemies.</p> <p>The club, with the first five countries as members, came into existence on 28 November. Brazil joined the next year, while Peru and Ecuador joined in 1978. At its height, Condor covered 10% of the world’s populated land mass, and formed what Francesca Lessa of Oxford University calls “a borderless area of terror and impunity”.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The Archive of Terror documents were revealing, but they were largely dry, bureaucratic records. Behind them lay a reality of the kidnap, torture, rape and murder of at least 763 people, according <a href=""https://sites.google.com/view/operationcondorjustice/database?authuser=0"" title="""">to a database that Lessa is building</a>. Yet it was only after the archive was found – and especially after Condor was named in Garzón’s Pinochet case – that the disconnected stories of the victims began to cohere into a bigger story.</p> <p>Laura Elgueta lives in a small house in La Reina, a tranquil suburb of Santiago where purple jacaranda trees blossom. She is one of Condor’s survivors. Her friend Odette Magnet – whose 27-year-old sister, María Cecilia, disappeared in Argentina in 1976 – lives a five-minute walk away. “When I was looking for somewhere to move to, I wanted to live near her,” Magnet explained as we made the walk to Elgueta’s home. Together, the two women have long shouldered the burden of explaining Condor to Chileans at human rights conferences and in the media.</p> <p>Although Condor operatives hunted down targets in all member states, their work focused on Argentina in particular, which was a refuge for exiles escaping military dictatorships across the continent before it, too, fell under military control. Condor squads dispatched to Argentina from Uruguay and Chile used a series of makeshift jails and torture centres provided by their hosts. The first was the abandoned car repair garage, Automotores Orletti, where Anatole Larrabeiti was held and his mother Victoria was last seen alive. Larrabeiti still recalls seeing a jar of glittering metal in the garage, in which victims’ wedding rings were kept.</p> <p>Later, Condor victims were taken to Club Atlético, a codename for the basement of a police warehouse in Buenos Aires. This is where a blindfolded, 18-year-old Laura Elgueta arrived in July 1977 with her sister-in-law, Sonia, after armed Chileans and Argentinians snatched them from her home nearby. At the time, Elgueta’s Chilean family – part of which was now exiled in Argentina – was still searching for her activist brother, Kiko, who had disappeared in Buenos Aires the previous July. “We knew he had been kidnapped, but that was all,” Elgueta told me.</p> <p>In the car, the sexual, physical and verbal abuse began. It continued at Club Atlético – where the women were stripped, handcuffed, hooded and given their numbers, K52 and K53. “Whoever walked past would insult you, or beat you, or throw you to the ground,” Elgueta recalled. They could hear fellow prisoners walking in chains. The Chilean torturers made no attempt to disguise their nationality, and Elgueta and Sonia’s interrogation focused solely on Chile’s exile community in Argentina. The women were taken to the torture room by turns. Beatings, more sexual abuse and electric shocks followed. “They’d say: ‘Now the party can really start.’ Despite all we know and have read, you cannot imagine what human beings are capable of. It was a house of horrors,” Elgueta told me. “When my sister-in-law came out of one session, they had given her such strong electric shocks that she was still trembling.”</p> <p>After eight hours, Elgueta and her sister-in-law were released. Their torturers had realised the two women knew nothing about Pinochet’s political or armed opponents. “As I left, the one [torturer] who had decided I was his girlfriend was there shouting: ‘Don’t take her away. I want to be with my girl!’” Elgueta was still blindfolded when she was driven away and dumped on a street corner near her home.</p>  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive element--supporting"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/09/archive-zip/giv-3902VbqsWJQfnwvq/"" data-alt=""cross-border human rights abuses in south america 1969-81""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/09/archive-zip/giv-3902VbqsWJQfnwvq/"">cross-border human rights abuses in south america 1969-81</a> </figure>  <p>Although Elgueta and Magnet had campaigned for Operation Condor to be investigated in Chile for years, they say that the media and politicians there only became interested after Pinochet was arrested in London. “Countries did not want to recognise that they had allowed armed units from other countries to operate on their territory,” Elgueta told me. “The ignorance about Condor here was incredible.”</p> <p>Awareness of Condor is now more widespread, and many deaths are finally being investigated by the courts, but that does not mean all Chileans think it was a bad idea. In fact, just as in Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, a small but significant part of Chilean society defends the dictatorship and its enforcers.</p> <p>One March afternoon in Santiago, I walked to La Alameda, the broad main avenue, which is officially called Avenida Libertador Bernardo O’Higgins, where daily battles were raging between rock-throwing protesters and teargas-armed police. Protests demanding reforms to the neoliberal state and constitution imposed by Pinochet had rumbled on since October 2019, reflecting broad anger at hangovers from that era – including allegations of police abuse under the conservative government of billionaire president Sebastián Piñera – the country’s fifth-richest man, whose brother served as a minister under Pinochet. Alleged victims, many of whom were demonstrators, talk of torture, rape, killings and attempted killings. “We never thought we would have to come back to Chile under these circumstances,” declared José Miguel Vivanco, of Human Rights Watch, when it presented <a href=""https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2020/country-chapters/chile#006f39"" title="""">a report</a> that counted injuries to more than 11,000 people in protests up to November 2019. “We thought this was history.”</p> <p>On the avenue, an empty teargas canister lying among freshly-hurled stones bore, by coincidence, the name “Condor” – a company that has long supplied the Chilean army and police. Protesters claimed these were being shot directly at people’s faces, helping account for more than 400 eye injuries. Piñera at first condemned protesters as being “at war against all good Chileans”, but has since ordered investigations and replaced his interior minister Andrés Chadwick (a former Pinochet supporter and cousin of Piñera), who was then punished by parliament with a ban from holding public office for five years. A referendum on constitutional change, which had been postponed because of Covid-19, is now scheduled for 25 October.</p> <p>On the outskirts of the city, Magnet took me to <a href=""https://santiagochile.com/villa-grimaldi/"" title="""">Villa Grimaldi</a>, a detention centre in a former restaurant complex where victims were sometimes locked for days inside tiny wooden boxes. It is now a museum that includes drawings by the English doctor Sheila Cassidy, who was tortured there after treating a wounded leader of the armed opposition to Pinochet. Cassidy later <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO8SD1HxtbM"" title="""">told of</a> how women prisoners were given electric shocks to the vagina and raped, including by dogs. On display at Villa Grimaldi is one of the concrete beams to which victims were tied before they were taken to be dropped into the sea from helicopters.</p> <p>Magnet and I looked for her sister María Cecilia’s name among the 188 small ceramic plaques set down beside rose bushes to commemorate each of Pinochet’s female victims. Magnet’s sister had been an active part of the exiled opposition. “Sometimes I wish she hadn’t been so brave, and had fled from Argentina before this happened, as others did,” said Magnet. Eventually we found María Cecilia’s plaque, beside a bush of pale yellow roses.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Although many of the men who carried out Operation Condor were alumni of the US army’s School of the Americas – a training camp in Panama for military from allied regimes across the continent – this was not a US-led operation. Recent revelations, however, show just how much western intelligence services knew about Condor.</p> <p>Shortly before I travelled to Chile in March, startling news emerged about a Swiss company that had, for decades, supplied cryptography machines to military, police and spy agencies around the world. The company, the Washington Post <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/national-security/cia-crypto-encryption-machines-espionage/"" title="""">revealed</a>, had been secretly owned by the CIA and West Germany’s BND intelligence service. Any messages sent via its cryptography machines could, unbeknownst to the users, be read by the US and West Germany. Among the company’s clients were the regimes in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Uruguay. As the Washington Post put it, the CIA “was, in effect, supplying rigged communications gear to some of South America’s most brutal regimes and, as a result, in [a] unique position to know the extent of their atrocities”.</p> <p>The new information about the rigged cryptography machines follows the revelations, from a declassified document handed to Argentina by the US last year, that West German, British and French intelligence services even explored the possibility of copying at least part of the Condor method in Europe. A heavily redacted <a href=""https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5817674/National-Security-Archive-Doc-13-CIA.pdf"" title="""">CIA cable</a> from September 1977 is headed: “Visit of representatives of West German, French and British intelligence services to Argentina to discuss methods for establishment of an anti-subversive organization similar to Condor”. The visit coincided with cross-frontier terror campaigns by Germany’s Baader-Meinhof gang, Italy’s Red Brigades and the Irish Republican Army. According to the cable, the visitors explained that “the terrorist/subversive threat had reached such dangerous levels in Europe that they believed it best if they pooled their intelligence resources in a cooperative organization such as Condor”.</p> <p>There is no evidence that this plan went any further, but we know that by that point, Condor countries were planning a Europe-wide assassination campaign. Chile had already independently carried out attacks in Europe, including an assassination attempt in Rome, in October 1975, on the exiled Chilean politician Bernardo Leighton. Now Condor teams were to kill people of any nationality living in Europe who they deemed terrorist leaders – though “non-terrorists also were reportedly candidates”, a CIA report from May 1977 reveals. The report states that “leaders of Amnesty Internation[al] were mentioned as targets”.</p> <p>Fortunately for those on the hit list, the blustering nationalism of generals in different Latin American countries, who had spent much of their careers preparing to fight each other – rather than “subversives” at home – came to a head in 1978, when Chile and Argentina fell out over their maritime frontiers in the Beagle Channel. The quarrelling made military cooperation between them impossible, and eventually provoked the collapse of the wider Condor network, putting paid to the campaign in Europe. Just a few years later, Chile would secretly assist Britain in the Falklands war, which would, in turn, lead to the fall of Argentina’s military junta in 1983.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The dictatorships fell, one by one, during the 80s. In the wake of these upheavals, attempts to prosecute human rights abusers in Condor countries were either nonexistent, or easily stalled, amid widespread fear that the military would rebel and reimpose dictatorship. Argentina’s former junta leaders were tried and found guilty of human rights abuses in 1985, but soon pardoned – and an amnesty law introduced. In Uruguay, an amnesty was approved in 1986, hours before Condor officers and others were due in court for the first time. It seemed that some of the most heinous crimes of the 20th century were destined to go unpunished.</p> <p>That began to change with Pinochet’s arrest in London. “It was Garzón who woke the world up to this,” Laura Elgueta told me. As Pinochet’s arrest highlighted, amnesty laws did not provide universal protection, and Condor was a weak spot. In retrospect, those who expected lifelong impunity for their involvement in Condor made three key mistakes. First of all, they stole children, a crime that even amnesties did not cover. Second, they wrongly assumed that amnesties would cover crimes committed on foreign soil. Finally, they hid their killings by making victims disappear – thereby turning those crimes into ongoing, unresolved kidnappings, which, unlike a murder where a body is found, cannot be covered by a statute of limitations or an amnesty for past events. These errors allowed a bold group of prosecutors and judges to bypass amnesty laws in a handful of carefully selected cases. These, in turn, revealed such ghastly truths that some governments were shamed into voiding the amnesty laws.</p> <p>In Argentina, the trial of one of Elgueta’s Chilean kidnappers, for a separate assassination in 1974, produced a 2001 court ruling that statutes of limitations did not apply to crimes against humanity – which include torture, murder and kidnapping. As these were crimes routinely committed by a military regime that had “disappeared” more than 20,000 of its citizens during the so-called dirty war, this ruling undermined the Argentinian amnesty laws, and they were <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3146379.stm"" title="""">annulled</a> in 2003. Uruguay’s amnesty law, meanwhile, was voided in 2011 at the behest of the Inter-American court of human rights in Costa Rica, after it had investigated the case of a kidnapped baby who had been held with Anatole Larrabeiti and his sister at the military intelligence headquarters in Montevideo.</p> <p>Chile’s amnesty law still stands but, by 2002, a series of court decisions had left it almost toothless, declaring that it could not be applied to operations abroad, forced disappearances or cases with child victims. Of the major Condor countries, only Brazil conserves its amnesty law intact, and it remains the country where least progress has been made in pursuing crimes committed by its military dictatorship.</p> <p>By 2011, with most amnesties cancelled or deemed largely inapplicable, Condor cases could finally be investigated more freely – and information began to flow between investigators in multiple countries. Two long-running cases – the one instigated by Aurora Meloni in Italy, along with another in Argentina – have come to sentencing in the past five years. In 2016, the trial in Argentina, which centred on 109 Condor victims from six countries, ended with 15 prison sentences – including for former junta president Reynaldo Bignone, who was then 87. Seven other accused men died during the three-year trial. The sentence was the first to recognise “a transnational, illegal conspiracy … dedicated to persecuting, kidnapping, forcefully repatriating, torturing and murdering political activists.” Argentina, it added, had become “a hunting ground”.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""efecb35d379ded698743acf37e27e4b5f90a09d4""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/efecb35d379ded698743acf37e27e4b5f90a09d4/0_0_4096_2969/1000.jpg"" alt=""Former Argentinian junta president Reynaldo Bignone (right) and former general Santiago Riveros (centre) at their trial for crimes against humanity in 2012."" width=""1000"" height=""725"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Former Argentinian junta president Reynaldo Bignone (right) and former general Santiago Riveros (centre) at their trial for crimes against humanity in 2012.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Leo la Valle/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Rome case extended the investigation to suspects from Peru, Bolivia and Chile. As in Argentina, it required unprecedented – if sluggish and sometimes failed – collaboration between countries, but the conclusion was the same: Condor was an illegal international network of state terror. Both sentences provided not only justice but, in their detailed investigation and description of what had happened, a telling of history as well.</p> <p>Thanks also to dozens of smaller cases across eight countries, many Condor victims have had their day in court. Francesca Lessa <a href=""https://sites.google.com/view/operationcondorjustice/database?authuser=0"" title="""">has counted</a> a total of 469 Condor victims during its most coordinated phase, between 1976 and 1978, and a further 296 in the years of more bilateral operations immediately prior to and after the main Condor period. They include 23 cases involving children, and at least 370 murders. Almost 60% of those cases have gone through court, or are in the process of doing so – with 94 people handed jail sentences (though often to men who can’t be extradited from their home countries to serve them).</p> <p>By the standards of human rights investigations, where progress is often slow and halting, that is good work. Yet given the enormity of the crimes, it is hard to feel that justice has truly been served. Only a few dozen people – mostly elderly men who are already in jail – have been found guilty. Many others, such as Campos Hermida, died without having to justify their actions. No one has begged forgiveness or revealed where bodies are buried. “Nobody here has confessed,” said Uruguayan prosecutor Mirtha Guianze, whose country has the most victims but only a handful of convictions.</p> <p>Fear of rightwing extremist violence still stalks South America, especially among survivors. Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro’s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/30/brazil-bolsonaro-regime-military-dictatorship"" title="""">defence of his county’s dictatorship</a> is especially worrying. The idea that a network similar to Condor might one day reappear is not fanciful. The best shield against that is to ensure perpetrators of state terrorism go to jail, even if that takes decades. “It would be presumptuous to claim that tyranny will stop because of this,” Pablo Ouviña, the prosecutor who led the Buenos Aires trial, told me. “What we can show, however, is that if it does reappear, it will be probably be tried in court later on.” That is the gift victims of Operation Condor can leave for future generations.</p> <p>Anatole Larrabeiti is nearing the end of his personal judicial marathon. “It has been continuous over almost my whole adult life,” he said. He and his sister first took their case to a civil court in Argentina in 1996, as a way of determining the truth of what had happened to them and receiving compensation. After two decades of fruitless attempts to find redress, and constant rebuffs from Argentinian courts, in 2019 their case was taken up by the Inter-American court of human rights – which can call on states to pay compensation and change laws. “I’m pretty sure we will win,” Larrabeiti said. The court’s decision could oblige Argentina to change the way it handles cases like this, and set precedent for other countries. It may also mean that Larrabeiti and his sister finally receive compensation. But that is not what matters most to him. “Up to now, the task of finding evidence has too often been on us. We want that changed,” he said.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/14/roberto-kozak-chile-latin-america-schindler"">Latin America’s Schindler: a forgotten hero of the 20th century</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As we finished talking, Larrabeiti admitted that he had felt his voice cracking while he delved through his memories, thinking of his parents or the other stolen children. “Did you notice? It was in my throat,” he said. “My sister was very young, and unlike me she has no concrete memories of our parents, but that does not mean there are no emotional scars.” Justice in court is important for preventing a repeat of the past, he believes, but so too is memory. “We can contribute to that,” he said.</p> <p>Anatole himself has chosen to live without bitterness, swallowing down the rage that he once felt – even towards his biological parents and the dangers to which they exposed the family. “I was furious. Why did they have children? Then I realised – it was an act of faith,” he told me. “Just as it is an act of faith to talk about it now, even though people may think it impossible that something like this could ever have happened.” </p> <p>• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=""https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread"" title="""">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email"" title="""">here</a>.",False,pillar/news,News,"['rape', 'gang-rape']"

The West Midlands trust is due to appear at Dudley magistrates court on Wednesday over alleged lapses in safety and patient care at Russells Hall hospital in the town.</p> <p>The CQC claims the hospital breached its duty under regulations 12 and 22 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014 to ensure patients receive safe care and treatment and are protected from avoidable harm.</p> <p>It is only the fifth time the regulator has prosecuted an NHS trust and the second time it has laid charges against an acute hospital.

The second case involves the death of Kaysie-Jane Bland, who was left with serious and permanent injuries and profoundly disabled as a result of being starved of oxygen during her birth at Wordsley hospital. She had cerebral palsy and was unable to walk, speak or sit by herself. In 2010 her mother, Jane Robinson, won a legal action for damages against the trust.</p> <p>The trust did not say how it would plead. In a statement it said: “It would be inappropriate for the trust to comment on the CQC prosecution while court proceedings are active.

His impactful debut album Ready to Die was followed by Life After Death, released 16 days after he was killed aged 24, in a still-unsolved, drive-by shooting. Yet while there have been several filmic attempts to capture this legascy –– including <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/may/24/2pac.popandrock"">Nick Broomfield’s 2002 documentary Biggie &amp; Tupac</a> and the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/13/notorious-big-biopic-film-review"">2009 biopic Notorious</a> –– this Netflix release is the first to successfully sidestep the quicksand of murder mystery, and focus instead on what Wallace accomplished in life.</p> <p>Clearly redressing that balance was the motivation of at least two executive producers, including Wallace’s label boss and friend, Sean “Diddy” Combs, who early on declares: “This story doesn’t have to have a tragic ending.” It’s the contribution of Wallace’s mother, though, that’s particularly significant. Firstly in the form of family photos and stories illustrating a childhood spent between their Brooklyn neighbourhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant and her family’s home in Trelawny, Jamaica. There, young Wallace’s favourite uncle exposed him to sound system culture, while back in Brooklyn a jazz musician neighbour played him Max Roach and Clifford Brown. So that by the time a 17-year-old Biggie triumphed in the now-legendary rap battle on Bedford and Quincy, he was already “rhyming in a way that exudes all the finer qualities of a bebop drum solo”.</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRj2NxkM84U""                                                                        >  <iframe height=""259"" width=""460"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fRj2NxkM84U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>More subtly though, Ms Wallace’s involvement gives permission for loyal associates to open up about the “gangster” part of “gangster rapper”.

Reggiani, called the “Black Widow” by the Italian media during her trial, was released from prison in 2016 after serving 17 years of her 29-year sentence.

Zarif’s remarks followed the presence of two US B-52 bombers in the region earlier this week, and an aircraft carrier redeployed to the Indian Ocean.</p> <p>“Instead of fighting Covid in US, @realDonaldTrump &amp; cohorts waste billions to fly B52s &amp; send armadas to OUR region,” Zarif said in a tweet. “Intelligence from Iraq indicate plot to FABRICATE pretext for war. Iran doesn’t seek war but will OPENLY &amp; DIRECTLY defend its people, security &amp; vital interests.”</p> <p>Throughout Trump’s time in office, Iraq has been a theatre for both direct and proxy clashes between Tehran and Washington. One year ago on Sunday, a US drone assassinated the powerful Iranian general, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/baghdad-airport-iraq-attack-deaths-iran-us-tensions"">Qassem Suleimani</a>, outside Baghdad airport and Iran then launched up to 30 ballistic missiles at US bases in central Iraq and the northern city of Erbil. The flashpoints drew the two sides closer to an extended confrontation than at any time in recent decades.</p> <p>Hossein Dehghan, an adviser to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, joined in the warnings: “I saw on the news that the Americans are on alert for fear of the revenge (over Suleimani’s killing) and have flown two B-52 bombers over the Persian Gulf.</p> <p>“All their military bases in the region are covered by our missiles. I advise the White House evictee (Trump) not to turn the New Year into mourning for Americans,” he said.</p> <p>The top commander of the<strong> </strong>paramilitary Revolutionary Guards added that Iran was fully prepared to respond. “Today, we have no problem, concern or apprehension toward encountering any powers. We will give our final words to our enemies on the battlefield,” Gen Hossein Salami said at a ceremony at Tehran University for the anniversary of Suleimani’s death.</p> <p>Suleimani’s replacement, Brig Gen Esmail Ghaani, warned at the ceremony that “freedom seekers” within the US could retaliate for the attack, telling the US that “inside your own home, there might be those who want to respond to the crime that you committed”.</p> <p>In the year since Suleimani’s death, a series of rocket attacks against Baghdad’s Green Zone, where the US embassy is located, have drawn bellicose threats from Trump and the outgoing secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/20/us-claims-it-is-still-part-of-nuclear-deal-in-attempt-to-resume-iran-sanctions"">who has spearheaded attempts to topple the Iranian regime</a> through a so-called “maximum pressure” policy of sanctions.</p> <p>Over the past decade, nearly all rocket attacks into the Green Zone have been carried out by Iranian-allied militia groups. As Trump’s term has neared its end, the attacks have taken on greater meaning. The proxies are determined to create an impression of resilience and defiance, and Trump wishes to avoid appearing to leave office under fire.</p> <p>Iraqi militias are also enmeshed in a power struggle with the Iraqi prime minister, Mustafa al-Kadhimi, a US ally, whom Trump officials have leaned on to crack down on leaders of the militia groups. Iraqi forces have at times detained rocket crews, but have not secured convictions, preferring to avoid directly opposing their powerful neighbour, which holds significant sway over events in Iraq.</p> <p>Officials in Baghdad are concerned that militia groups may attempt to mark the first anniversary of Suleimani’s death and that of a second Iranian allied military leader, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was killed in the same strike. “Messages have been delivered to them,” said an official close to the Iraqi president, Barham Salih. “They are being watched very closely.”</p> <p>A US official briefed reporters in Washington earlier this week that preparations for a militia strike had been observed in Iraq. In the days before Christmas, Trump appeared to put Iraqi militias on notice. “Some friendly health advice to Iran: If one American is killed, I will hold Iran responsible. Think it over,” he wrote on 23 December.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Pentagon said on Thursday it would withdraw the aircraft carrier Nimitz and its support ships from the coast of the Horn of Africa, where it had been stationed after being ordered back to the region late last year. The announcement was seen as a conciliatory sign from Washington.</p> <p>But in another development likely to increase tensions in the region Iran on Friday told the United Nations nuclear watchdog that it plans to enrich uranium to up to 20% purity, a level it achieved before its 2015 accord. </p> <p>The move is the latest of several recent announcements by Iran to the International Atomic Energy Agency that it plans to further breach the deal, which it started violating in 2019 in retaliation for Washington’s withdrawal from the agreement and the reimposition of US sanctions against Tehran.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting: </em><em>agencies.</em",False,pillar/news,News,['honor killing']

She said that the investigation would cover “every aspect” of the events of 6 January and look at “everyone who was involved”.</p> <p>But she reserved her most pointed words for Trump. “People will want to know what the president was doing,” she said. “They will want to know whether the tweet that he sent out calling Vice-President Mike Pence a coward while the attack was underway was a premeditated attempt to provoke violence.”</p> <p>Cheney’s evoking of possible criminal action against the former president comes just two days before the start of his impeachment trial in the US senate for “incitement of insurrection”. Though she will not be participating as a juror at the trial – that role is performed by senators – her comments signaled the turmoil that the impending proceedings are causing in her party.</p> <p>Last week <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/liz-cheney-republican-conference-chairwoman-vote/"">she survived</a> an attempt by fellow House Republicans to remove her from her leadership position in protest at her support of Trump’s impeachment. On Saturday, the Republican party in her home state of Wyoming <a href=""https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/06/wyoming-gop-censure-liz-cheney-466561"">voted to censure her</a>, calling for her immediate resignation.</p> <p>Cheney said Sunday she would not step down. “The oath I took to the constitution compelled me to vote for impeachment – it does not bend to partisanship or political pressure, and I will stand by that.”</p> <p>But the swirl of criticism around her, coupled with her sharp reference to possible criminal consequences for Trump, point to how the former president continues to roil the Republican party, to the extent of threatening to tear it apart.</p> <p>On Tuesday, he will make US history by becoming the first sitting or former president to be subjected to an impeachment trial for a second time.</p> <p>Ahead of the historic proceedings, prominent Democrats took to the Sunday political shows and spoke with passion about why Trump deserved to be convicted for his role in allegedly inciting the 6 January assault. Ayanna Pressley, a congresswoman from Massachusetts, called on senators to “honor their oath and hold Trump accountable and bar him from ever holding office again”.</p> <p>Speaking on CNN’s State of the Union, she recalled the “harrowing and traumatic” assault on the Capitol and placed it in personal and historical context. “As a black woman, to be barricaded in my office, on the ground, in the dark – that terror is familiar in a deep and ancestral way for me.”</p> <p>She said she was haunted by the image of black staff in the Capitol building cleaning up the mess caused by the white supremacist insurrection. “That is a metaphor for America. We have been cleaning up for white supremacist mobs for generations – and it must end,” she said.</p> <p>By contrast, there was little sign among Republican senators of any substantial appetite to convict. Should all 50 Democratic senators vote to do so, they would still need to be joined by 17 Republican senators to reach the two-thirds majority required by the constitution.</p> <p>Rand Paul, the Republican senator from Kentucky, said Tuesday’s trial was an attempt to criminalise political speech. Speaking on Fox News Sunday, he said: “Are we going to impeach and potentially criminally prosecute people for political speech when they say ‘Get up and fight for your country, let your voices be heard’?”</p> <p>The Republican senator from Louisiana, Bill Cassidy, told NBC News’s Meet the Press that the trial had been rushed. “There was no process. If it happened in the Soviet Union you would call it a show trial.”</p> <p>Pat Toomey, the Republican senator from Pennsylvania who has been critical of Trump, told CNN that he thought it “very unlikely” that the former president would be convicted.

Biden has not said whether he supports expanding the court, also known as “court packing.” </p> <p>During his presidency, Trump appointed three justices to the court, among them was a seat that Republicans had blocked his predecessor, Barack Obama, from filling. Despite arguing in 2016 that the seat should be filled by winner of the year’s presidential election, Republicans rushed to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated by death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg just weeks before the 2020 election. </p> <p>The result was one of the most ideologically conservative courts in modern times.</p> <p>The executive order directs the commission to complete its report within 180 days of its first meeting.

Turnover in the industry is high, and the vast majority of officers aren’t represented by a union.</p> <p>But there are more security officers working in California than in any other state, <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/ooh/protective-service/security-guards.htm"">according</a> to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. More than 580,000 people in the state hold an active security officer license, according to the state’s bureau of security and investigative services. With a wide range of responsibilities, their ages range from those fresh out of high school to senior citizens.</p> <p>California’s state health department has issued workplace regulations related to Covid-19, but in the security field, they are often applied inconsistently based on the size and individual will of a company that contracts security officers, security guards say.</p> <p>Dr Anthony Iton, a public health expert who has run departments in California and Connecticut, said security officers could benefit from “a societal stamp of approval”.</p> <p>“The acknowledgment strengthens their argument for hazard pay and investments to make their workplaces safer,” Iton said. “It also raises their status as a critical element of our society. They are heroes just like healthcare workers are heroes.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""1b0b70431216b359e10072c43a4f25d668140b0e""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/1b0b70431216b359e10072c43a4f25d668140b0e/0_0_3500_2335/1000.jpg"" alt=""Robert Branch, 60, a security professional for Allied Universal, in Downtown Los Angeles."" width=""1000"" height=""667"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Robert Branch, 60, a security professional for Allied Universal, in Downtown Los Angeles.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Philip Cheung/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>•••</p> <p>“I don’t see anyone raising the flag for us,” said Regina McMillian, a 58-year-old guard who has been working in the industry for four decades and is a member of the SEIU-USWW bargaining committee and is a shop steward who files grievances on behalf of union members. “It’s like we’re dead to the public. But that’s why we need to take a stand: because we’re very much alive.”</p> <p>McMillian monitors patients on psychiatric and medical holds at a northern California hospital. With decades of experience as a guard she can “do the job with her eyes closed”, she said, but the pandemic has contributed to higher turnover and anxiety among officers who are new to working in hospitals, especially those in the emergency department.</p> <p>Since<strong> </strong>the beginning of the pandemic, McMillian said, officers told her they would have to use their vacation days or file worker’s compensation and disability claims to get time off if they contracted Covid. She learned that hospital and security agencies across the state were slow to recognize that typical tasks for officers now carried more risk and to address the concerns of officers who interact with people who may be infected. “The adrenaline is flowing more for the officers and the mood has become, ‘Damn I don’t wanna catch Covid. Should I find another job?’” she said.</p> <p>McMillian recently got vaccinated through the vaccination program of the hospital she works at. She hopes her peers working in different settings will get the same opportunity. “It was offered to me and I took it,” McMillian said. “But I feel that all security officers – union or otherwise – should be offered the injection.”</p> <p>Representatives for the field said they are working to get guards access to vaccines, just as they are continuing to battle for access to protective gear, as well as “hero pay” – the financial compensation cities throughout California have approved for grocery workers.</p> <p>Neither the union for security officers nor any security trade associations are currently represented on the state’s Community Vaccine Advisory <a href=""https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-311.aspx"">Committee</a>, the group that helps guide <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/16/california-coronavirus-vaccine-equity-racial-justice"">equity</a> efforts in California’s vaccine distribution.

Exploring six different facets of human experience – adolescence, sexuality, gender, relationships, identity and race – the book will draw on Bergdorf’s own experiences, including growing up in a mixed-race family, going to an all-boys school and starting her transition at the age of 24. In it, she will argue that transition is an experience every person faces in every phase in life, “and that only by recognising this can we understand times of change”.</p> <p>Bergdorf told the Guardian that she envisaged the book as “a manifesto for how I see society changing for the better, bringing us all closer”. The trans experience, she said, is “thought of by a lot of people as this far-off idea that isn’t that relatable. I wanted to drive home the fact that we all transition in one way or another. None of us stays the same. We’re all on a journey, and a transition with regards to gender is just one of many we all experience as human beings.”</p> <p>The book will explore the history of gender throughout the world, including Polynesian, Indian and Native American cultures that recognised more than two genders before the colonial era. “I’ve gone into the depths of where gender came from, because it hasn’t always existed in [the way] we think about gender today,” said Bergdorf. “What it’s like to be a cisgender woman today is not what it was in the middle ages, or the 1950s, or even the 1980s.”</p> <p>The book will also take in current discussions around gender and sexuality, “because even though it looks like we’re living in a progressive society, how progressive is it when we’re still fighting against conversion therapy, and Boris Johnson is trying to wind back trans rights?” she said.</p> <p>The deal’s announcement comes after Black Lives Matter protests have forced a global reckoning on race, with the newly formed <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/15/black-writers-guild-calls-for-sweeping-change-in-uk-publishing"">Black Writers’ Guild</a> renewing calls for sweeping change in the overwhelmingly white UK publishing industry. But Bergdorf’s deal was actually struck last year, when she presented an 80,000-word proposal for the first time. It was an “incredible” feeling, she said, to have 11 publishers bidding to publish it, and she was “blown away” by Bloomsbury’s associate publisher Alexis Kirschbaum, who eventually acquired it in what the publisher said was likely to be the biggest book deal for a black, trans woman. Kirschbaum praised Bergdorf for having “a point of view that is exceptionally wise and humane, and the life experience to back it up”.</p> <p>As a model and an outspoken activist, who was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/sep/04/munroe-bergdorf-on-the-loreal-racism-row-it-puzzles-me-that-my-views-are-considered-extreme"">hired and fired by L’Oréal in the space of a week</a> in 2017 over comments she made in response to violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, Bergdorf said she felt that, until now, “my intelligence has been undermined, and I’ve been underestimated a lot in a lot of different instances”.</p> <p>“I’m looking forward to sharing a piece of work where people can actually read what I’m about firsthand, instead of seeing me when I pop up in the papers every now and again,” she said. “If I can change people’s minds about how they view people who aren’t like them, and how they view human difference, than that is a job done.”</p> <p>Gen Z, she said, “take a much more fluid approach to gender and sexuality … and I think that that’s where we need to go. We need to stop labeling ourselves with archaic definitions of humanity because we’re not simple. Humans are complex and you can’t label everything and you can’t label everybody else either. I feel like we need to widen how we see ourselves, and widen how we see each other, because then you realise that we all want the same thing.”</p> <p>Bergdorf has spoken out recently about fellow Bloomsbury author JK Rowling, whose recent comments about transgender rights Bergdorf described as transphobic. She also referred the UK peer Emma Nicholson to the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CBrF5cngoUu/"">Parliamentary Standards Conduct Commissioner</a>, for her posts on social media about the trans community.</p> <p>“It’s such a shame, especially with these gender critical feminists like JK Rowling and Baroness Nicholson,” she said. “I think if they actually sat down with me and communicated in a respectful way instead of posting things about our community that are detrimental to the mental health, physical wellbeing and emotional wellbeing of trans people, they would see that trans people want what’s best for cisgender women, too. One group of society’s rights isn’t to the detriment of anybody else’s – equal rights are equal rights.

He then recorded himself raping them, sometimes for hours at a time.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/25/friends-flatmates-reynhard-sinaga"">‘I thought, OK, he goes for drunk guys’: friends and flatmates on the Reynhard Sinaga they knew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/06/reynhard-sinaga-jailed-life-drugging-raping-men-manchester"">convicted earlier this month</a> of drugging and assaulting 48 men between 1 January 2015 and 2 June 2017. But detectives from Greater Manchester police (GMP) think he may have begun raping men in 2005.</p> <p>They have found photos, videos and “trophy items” that suggest he attacked 195 men between 2005 and 2017.</p> <p>One of Sinaga’s former flatmates, between 2013-2015, told the Guardian that he now believes Sinaga may have been raping men while they lived together.</p> <p>In an exclusive interview with the Guardian’s Weekend magazine, the 27-year-old said he met one potential victim in 2014. He remembers a young man knocked on the door to say he had woken up in the flat and wanted to know if he had been raped.</p> <p>The flatmate did not report it to the police at the time but now says he will help any victims he met by giving evidence for them in court.</p> <p>Sinaga had no criminal record and had never been suspected of any crimes until 2 June 2017, when his final victim woke up mid-assault and beat him up so badly that he was taken to hospital.</p> <p>In an account confirmed by GMP, the flatmate also remembered Sinaga twice calling 999 – once when a man he brought home turned violent, and oncein February 2015, to ask for help evicting said flatmate.</p> <p>In the first instance, the flatmate recalled Sinaga bringing home a “giant, terrifying-looking man” who ended up starting a fight shortly after Sinaga took him into his bedroom.</p> <p>A spokesman for GMP said: “Police were called to the flat to reports of a disturbance and yes it does appear that Sinaga did not want to take any action with regards to arrests or charges.</p> <p>“The man was asked to leave and was arrested for being drunk and disorderly but this was based on his behaviour outside the building a short time later rather than the disturbance with Sinaga. There is no evidence to link this man to Sinaga as a potential victim and the man has no memory of the disturbance.”</p> <p>On another occasion the flatmate remembered breaking up a fight between Sinaga and another “very drunk” young man . “I think he thought Rey had tried to touch him and he didn’t really know why he was there,” the flatmate claimed, saying he found the man in their hallway in his boxer shorts.</p> <p>Sinaga also called 999 on 20 February 2015 after the flatmate refused to move out. He was advised it was a “civil matter”, said the GMP spokesman.</p> <p>The Guardian understands at least 30 new complainants have come forward since Sinaga was sentenced to life and told he will serve a minimum of 30 years before being considered for parole.</p> <p>After his arrest in June 2017, police examined Sinaga’s multiple digital devices and discovered 3.29 terabytes of extremely graphic material – equivalent to 250 DVDs or 300,000 photos – depicting sexual assaults lasting, in one case, for eight hours. They also found what the judge, Suzanne Goddard, QC, referred to as “souvenirs” of his crimes: watches, driving licences, passports and phones stolen from his victims.</p> <p>“The 195 potential victims are spread between 2005 and 2017. The evidence is a combination of stills, video (not all offences were recorded) and trophy items taken from victims,” said a GMP spokesman.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/16/reynhard-sinaga-court-to-decide-on-whole-life-sentence-for-rapist"">The attorney general</a> is currently considering a request from the Crown Prosecution Service to increase Sinaga’s sentence which could see him become the first non-murderer to receive a “whole life” term.",False,pillar/news,News,"['rape', 'gang-rape']"

It will bring the total number of child marriages to around 12.5m in 2020.</p> <p>The report warns of 2020 being a year of “irreversible setbacks and lost progress” for girls. Around the world, school closures have interrupted the education of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jun/01/many-girls-have-been-cut-how-coronavirus-global-school-closures-left-children-at-risk"">1.6 billion children</a>, and Save the Children estimates that 10 million children, mostly girls, will never return to school.</p> <p>The report also predicts that a million more girls under 18 could fall pregnant this year, putting lives at risk with childbirth still the leading cause of death among 15- to 19-year-olds.</p> <p>The worst affected region for the surge in child marriage is south Asia, where almost 200,000 more girls are expected to be forced into wedlock this year owing to economic strife caused by coronavirus.</p> <p>India, which accounts for a third of all child marriages globally, has been one of the worst affected countries in the pandemic, both in terms of health and economy.

India’s economy contracted by almost 24% in the last quarter, the worst decline on record, and even after lockdown was lifted, industry and therefore work opportunities have been hugely reduced.</p> <p>With parents from low-income families unable to find work and schools closed indefinitely, in India the onus is falling on children to either go out to work or be forced into marriage.</p> <p>Kevin Watkins, the chief executive of Save the Children UK, said: “A growing risk of violence and sexual exploitation combined with growing food and economic insecurity – especially in humanitarian emergencies – means many parents feel they have little alternative but to force their girls to marry men who are often much older.</p> <p>“These marriages violate girls’ rights and leave them at increased risk of depression, lifelong violence, disabilities, and even death from childbirth.”</p> <p>The pandemic has also led to an increase in reports of child labour and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/28/child-trafficking-india-domestic-labour-chhattisgarh"">child trafficking in India</a>.

But only eight of 128 legislators voted in favor.</p> <p>“We live in an extremely conservative society,” said Beatriz Valle, a former legislator for the center-left Libre party who was one of those who voted in favor of decriminalisation. “It’s a matter of public health, but the people don’t want to see it that way.”</p> <p>The constitutional reform would also exclude the possibility of a court ruling, such as Roe v Wade in the United States, or the passing of a new constitution, to overturn the prohibition.</p> <p>Pro-choice activists say that the reform will not prevent abortions, but rather maintain the status quo in which many women – particularly those who cannot afford to simply fly to another country where the practice is legal – are obliged to seek out abortions in unsafe conditions.</p> <p>“There have been cases where once you do the physical examination you find coins or even nails in the vaginal cavity,” said an OB/GYN at a local public hospital. He added that his hospital attends to roughly 150 miscarriages a month, many of whom are teenage girls who he suspects may have aborted. </p> <p>Performing or undergoing an abortion in Honduras carries a penalty of three to six years in jail, but charges are rarely filed.</p> <p>The confinement that came with the Covid-19 pandemic has only worsened conditions for women in the country, which suffers the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/29/honduras-blind-eye-femicides"">highest rate of femicide in Latin America</a> and endemic sexual violence.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jan/18/dominican-republic-total-abortion-ban"">Dominican Republic activists fear total abortion ban banishes women to the dark ages</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We closed 2020 with more than 100,000 calls to 911 from women suffering domestic violence,” said Alvarado. “Of those calls, only 2.5% resulted in criminal complaints.” Even fewer resulted in a conviction.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the number of 10- to 14-year-old girls who gave birth in 2020 increased to more than 800 nationwide, an average of 16 a week, according to Alvarado, in a country with a population similar to that of London.</p> <p>Despite the seemingly insurmountable opposition to progress on reproductive rights for women, feminist activists in Honduras find inspiration in the accomplishments achieved by their green wave counterparts across Latin America and are resolved to continue to fight.</p> <p>“We are going to keep fighting for the right to decide,” said Alvarado. “I think that if there’s something that we can learn from the Argentinians it’s to go step-by-step.

On Tuesday, his friend Bernard Kosia, who was with him, described him as a hero.</p> <p>“Jimi was adamant, for some reason, that he didn’t care (about himself). He didn’t think twice as to what was going to happen,” Kosia told ITV’s Good Morning Britain. “I just remember him saying ‘Bernard, I have to save her, I’m going to save her’.”</p> <p>He said: “Jimi means a lot to everyone. Especially around south London now, everyone knows him as a neighbourhood hero. To risk your life in such a way, you don’t see that every day. And the fact that he was adamant to save that woman, it just shows his nature and his mindset.”</p> <p>He spoke as Jimi’s parents called for him to be <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/apr/25/father-hails-hero-son-believed-to-have-died-trying-to-save-woman-from-thames"">posthumously honoured</a> for his act of courage.

We started joking around and I just remember Jimi looking at me like ‘Bernard, you know I love you, right?’ And I was like ‘Bro, I know you do, man’.”</p> <p>Two men, including Olubunmi-Adewole, are believed to have gone into the water to rescue the woman. The coastguard and the Metropolitan police’s marine unit rescued the woman and one of the men, but could not find Olubunmi-Adewole.</p> <p>His <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/apr/24/man-dies-trying-to-save-woman-who-fell-from-london-bridge"">body was found at 6am</a> on Saturday morning, police said. Det Ch Supt Oliver Shaw from City of London police described him as a “brave, kind and selfless young man”.</p> <p>He said: “Our officers arrived extremely quickly to the scene but two members of the public had already entered the water. One man had managed to swim to the woman and they were both seen above water by the coastguard. Sadly, there was no sign of the other rescuer.</p> <p>“The circumstances of this incident are extremely tragic.

At the time, Dorris was living with friends in Boca Raton, Florida, regularly travelling to Miami for modelling and occasional acting work. Binn, the founder of several luxury fashion and lifestyle magazines, was a friend of Trump; in 1999, he reportedly described the real estate businessman as his “best friend”.</p> \n<p>On Friday 5 September, Dorris said Binn took her to meet Trump at his office in Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan, before they went together to the US Open in Queens.</p> \n<p>“He came on very strong right away,” Dorris said of Trump. “It seemed typical of a certain guy, people who just feel like they’re entitled to do what they want … even though I was there with my boyfriend.”</p> \n<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""5f82095b3043a7fd23e2d8a00ea1395a2c083b66""> \n <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/5f82095b3043a7fd23e2d8a00ea1395a2c083b66/397_275_674_478/500.jpg"" alt=""Amy Dorris sat between Donald Trump and Jason Binn athe the US Open in Queens 1997."" width=""500"" height=""355"" class=""gu-image""> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=""element-image__caption"">Amy Dorris sat between Donald Trump and Jason Binn at the US Open in Queens 1997</span> \n  <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The couple were joined by other friends of Trump in his private box, a luxury carpeted suite that had a balcony overlooking the court.

She alleges Trump forced himself on her after a brief exchange in which she recalls nervously laughing and telling him: “No, get away.”</p> \n<p>She alleged she told Trump “no, please stop” but “he didn’t care”. “It doesn’t matter who you are,” she said. “Any time anyone says no, no means no. And that just didn’t work out for me. It wasn’t enough.”</p> \n<p>“I just kind of was in shock,” she added. “I felt violated, obviously. But I still wasn’t processing it and just was trying to go back to talking to everyone and having a good time because, I don’t know, I felt pressured to be that way.”</p> \n<p>Dorris cannot recall if she told Binn the full details of the alleged assault, but she says she asked him to tell Trump to leave her alone. She said she told Binn: “He’s all over me. I can’t deal with this.

Dorris first shared her allegation with the Guardian in confidence 15 months ago, but was unsure about going public. She recently decided she was ready to take that step, in part to be a role model to her daughters, who are now in their teens.</p> \n<p>“When you invade someone’s space, it doesn’t matter if you were raped, it’s sexual assault, and it’s not OK,” she said. “You don’t touch someone unless they want to be touched. And I did nothing to encourage him to touch me.”</p> \n<p>Dorris said she was also frustrated to hear Trump’s many other accusers being accused themselves of lying. “I’m sick of him getting away with this,” she said. “I’m tired of being quiet. It’s kind of cathartic. I just want to get this out. And I want people to know that this is the man, this is our president. This is the kind of thing he does and it’s unacceptable.”",False,pillar/news,News,"['sexual assault', 'sexual abuse']"

Australia does not comment on coalition partner involvement in Afghanistan, or matters related to the decisions of other governments.</p> </blockquote> <p>There are currently only about 80 Australian defence personnel in Afghanistan for an operation titled Highroad, <a href=""https://www1.defence.gov.au/operations/highroad"">according to the ADF website</a>. The personnel are there as part of the Nato Resolute Support mission that trains, advises and helps the Afghan national defence and security forces. The headquarters of the Australian task group in Afghanistan is at Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport.</p> <p>Biden declared overnight that it was time “to end America’s longest war” as he announced that nearly 10,000 US and Nato troops would return home from Afghanistan in the run-up to the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. Nato members, including the UK, have said they would join an “orderly, coordinated, and deliberate” removal of troops alongside the US. The Nato statement says the withdrawal of Resolute Support Mission forces will start by 1 May.</p> <p>Australian forces have suffered 41 combat deaths in Afghanistan since 2001, plus an Australian who was killed while serving for the British military.</p> <p>Estimates of civilian deaths in Afghanistan differ. A monitoring project by the London-based group Action on Armed Violence has tallied 49,039 deaths and injuries from explosive violence in Afghanistan between the beginning of 2011 and the end of 2020, with about 58% of these being civilians. That group began monitoring such deaths in 2011, 10 years into the conflict, so the true number is likely much higher.</p> <p>You can see the full story of Biden’s announcement here:</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/14/all-nato-troops-expected-to-leave-afghanistan-before-11-september"">Biden announces all US and Nato troops to leave Afghanistan by September 11 </a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2021-04-15T01:54:45.272Z"">at 2.54am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-607796518f0881c41469285e"" class=""block is-key-event"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2021-04-15T01:35:48.610Z"">2.35am <span class=""timezone"">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=""block-title"">Australian airlines confident despite vaccine program delays</h2>  <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>Australia’s major airline bosses have been out and about today discussing the looming reopening of the trans-Tasman bubbles.

I’ve alluded to Burnett being the preferred candidate a few times in recent stories (and on Politics Live) but this makes it official. </p> <p>Queensland will be a hard slog for Labor to win back – and at this stage, the main focus is returning the primary vote to something which will ensure the state delivers the party two senators again (the historic lows at the 2019 election saw Labor slip to just one Senate quota) but there are a couple of target seats, and Flynn, a resources seat, is one of them.</p> <p>Burnett won the mayoralty of Gladstone – one of the biggest regions in Flynn – with almost 73% of the primary vote. He has remained an exceptionally popular figure and is known locally for his advocacy of local issues. </p> <p>I understand it took some time for Albanese and the federal Labor team to convince Burnett to run and he had previously resisted.

They’re just stopping any exports from mainland UK over to Northern Ireland. We can’t get any trees over from any of the nurseries that we would usually deal with over there,” said Gregor Fulton, an estate and outreach manager at the trust.</p> <p>Scotland-based Alba Trees, one of the biggest suppliers in Britain, selling around 250,000 trees a year to Northern Ireland, says it has also been hit.</p> <p>“At a stroke, Brexit has taken away a huge chunk of our business,” said Craig Turner, the chief executive. “We turned down an order of 70,000 oaks a couple of weeks ago because we can’t ship them.”</p> <p>And Belfast city council, which has an ambitious tree-planting programme involving 1m plants, confirmed it had a delivery of “300 large specimen trees” from a supplier in England “delayed due to new rules around the movement of plants” from Britain.</p> <p>The horticulture division that Brexit has created between Britain and Northern Ireland is expected to be raised at meeting between local business leaders and the European commission vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, on Thursday. The issue is one of many problems caused by Brexit, including <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/feb/02/eu-rules-on-some-types-of-shellfish-leave-uk-fishermen-devastated"">a ban on the export of live shellfish to the EU</a>.</p> <p>“We thought it would be teething problems that would be resolved quickly. It just seems ludicrous really,” said Fulton. “The irony is that I can now get a tree easier from Latvia than I can from Britain, which totally undermines all the work on biosecurity,” he added, referring to the risk of importing pests and diseases.</p> <p>The problem arises from three new rules applying to Northern Ireland, which is observing EU customs and regulatory rules on plants and animals as part of the Northern Ireland protocol.</p> <p>A ban on British soil being moved into Northern Ireland emerged two weeks ago, with garden centres protesting about a block on supplies from British nurseries. Fulton said he had been told washing all the soil off roots could be the solution.</p> <p>“That’s just not practical. We got an order in last year of 56,000 trees in one go. You can’t wash 56,000 trees’ roots. It would be too big a cost and the nurseries are just not going to do that,” he said.</p> <p>If bare-rooted trees were available in sufficient quantities, buyers would then face Brexit paperwork involving health certification and customs for the plants.</p> <p>A further barrier stems from the EU’s list of species prohibited or restricted for import from third countries, which now includes the UK. The list is designed to protect Europe from diseases and pests, but includes native trees including oaks, alder and birch, important for mixed woodlands.</p> <p>Mike Harvey, director at Maelor Forest Nurseries in Wales, which sells about 32m trees a year, said it too had had to stop selling to Northern Ireland, with a recent order for 1,000 oaks about to be cancelled.</p> <p>What enrages Harvey is not so much the ban on movement of trees to Northern Ireland, but the continued importation of trees from Ireland for forestation projects. He said Brexit gave the UK an opportunity to close the border to EU trees and give the country a fighting chance of stopping the “drift of disease from south-east Europe to the north-west”.</p> <p>The diseases, which some put down to climate change, include ash dieback and the <a href=""https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/pest-and-disease-resources/xylella-xylella-fastidiosa/"">Xylella</a> disease, which could enter the UK via olive trees and can affect several species of broad-leaved tree.</p> <p>“It’s typical that the EU puts these restrictions in place and applies them rigorously in Northern Ireland but we leave the borders open to trees coming in from the EU including Ireland and the Netherlands,” Harvey said. “If we want to control disease and give ourselves a chance, it’s actually a good thing to stop transportation of these trees between our islands.”</p> <p>The obstructions have emerged just as Northern Ireland’s environment minister, Gordon Lyons, launches a campaign to remind farmers they have only weeks left to apply for funding to plant native woodlands to help deliver on a pledge to plant 18m trees by 2030.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it had “intensified work with the EU … to address the outstanding issues raised about the operation of the Northern Ireland protocol, such as those concerning the movements of plants, trees, soil and growing media”.</p> <p>It said the UK-EU joint committee to be held no later than 24 February would “provide the necessary political steer and approval to this work”.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 19 February 2021.

She was one of a dozen women who had sexual relationships with men who pretended to be their companions and allies in order to spy on their political activities. They courageously fought for justice, yet last night parliament passed a bill making it legal for undercover MI5 agents and police officers to commit crimes – including sexual assault, torture and murder – if this prevents a more serious crime or threat to national security. Only 20 Labour MPs <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/05/mi5-bill-prompts-second-labour-rebellion-in-two-weeks-jeremy-corbyn"">voted against the bill</a>, defying Keir Starmer’s instruction to abstain.</p> <p>Very few would dispute the need for undercover informants to break the law in certain circumstances to keep us safe. Campaigners have long argued for a legal framework for criminal acts committed by undercover agents, but while <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bill-c-51-bars-csis-from-committing-bodily-harm-sexual-violation-1.2938380"">Canada prohibits </a>undercover agents from engaging in killing, bodily harm or sexual assault, no such limits have been enshrined in UK law. The Human Rights Act exists as a safeguard against such offences, protests the government: an entirely disingenuous argument given that, as Reprieve’s executive director Anna Yearley tells me, “just a few months ago in court, and again last week in parliament, it argued that the act doesn’t apply to crimes committed by its agents”. Future survivors of abuses committed by undercover officers will be barred from seeking justice, because their abusers will be protected from civil liability for the rest of their lives.</p> <p>It’s not scaremongering to claim that agents of the British state could commit crimes against the very people they have been tasked with keeping safe. Eight years ago, then prime minister David Cameron apologised to the House of Commons for “<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/12/david-cameron-pat-finucane-murder"">shocking levels of collusion</a>” between agents of the British state and the loyalist murderers of Belfast lawyer Pat Finucane.</p> <p>Some groups are more vulnerable than others to secretive infiltration, threatening citizens’ democratic right to protest against government action. According to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2018/oct/15/uk-political-groups-spied-on-undercover-police-list"">research</a> by the Guardian, of the more than 1,000 groups targeted by undercover police in the last five decades, just three belonged to the far right. The vast majority hailed from the left, and included trade unionists and climate activists. One of the three tests an authorising officer must be satisfied has been passed is to safeguard “the interests of the economic wellbeing of the UK”. Agents of the state could commit offences to defend business interests from, for example, campaigners desperately trying to urge action to confront the climate emergency.</p> <p>If a police force wished to search a property for evidence, they would need to seek a warrant. But, as organisations such as Reprieve and the Pat Finucane Centre point out, the bill includes no system of warrants or independent judicial approval for the authorisation of crimes, meaning crimes by agents would be subject to even weaker oversight than phone tapping or searches by law enforcement.</p> <p>Rather than protecting our security, the bill could further threaten it. I have interviewed several <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/09/undercover-police-female-activists-inquiry-farce"">women who were violated</a> by undercover police officers. There were striking similarities in all their cases: the agent would concoct a story of having fallen out with or lost their family, and towards the end of their mission, would become withdrawn before leaving a note on the table ending the relationship. At meetings they would frequently take minutes – handy for intelligence gathering – and often possessed a large white van, allowing them to drop all activists back at their homes each evening and, in the process, find out their addresses. They would also often pose as the most radical, urging the most militant actions. As Labour’s former shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti tells me, the legislation “creates even greater temptations for agents provocateurs to incite peaceful protest movements into violent action. Those agents will know they are shielded from a British rule of law that was always supposed to apply to everyone equally”.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/sep/24/uk-set-to-introduce-bill-allowing-mi5-agents-to-break-the-law"">UK set to introduce bill allowing MI5 agents to break the law</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Starmer’s champions would undoubtedly rebut the idea that the former human rights lawyer would ever be sanguine about such dangerous infringements on rights and freedoms.<strong> </strong>The party’s argument goes like this: providing a legal framework for criminal acts committed by undercover agents is necessary, and Labour will propose amendments to deal with the bill’s pernicious elements.</p> <p>But cynics would suggest that a political calculation is at play. Labour cannot hope to overcome an 80-seat majority by ordering its MPs to vote against the bill, and some senior Labour figures brief that this posture is necessary to win back the former <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/working-class-voters-desert-labour-stoke-on-trent-england-red-wall"">red wall</a> heartlands, where voters, they believe, need to be convinced of the party’s commitment to national security. Those same shadow ministers and their advisers applied the same logic just two weeks earlier when Labour also abstained on the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/20/overseas-operations-bill-uk-government-bend-rules-torture-soldiers"">overseas operations bill</a>.</p> <p>However, accepting the government’s terms of debate is no way to conduct an opposition. Voting against the bill would have granted Labour the political authority to make an unambiguous and compelling argument to the electorate about the Conservative menace to a hard-won democracy. Now the deed is done, Labour must back amendments suggested by Reprieve that would impose limits on offences that undercover agents can commit, to ensure oversight mechanisms, and to allow the prosecuting authorities to independently review crimes.</p> <p>It fell to a new generation of Labour MPs – including Apsana Begum and Zarah Sultana, both in their 20s – to offer leadership in the Commons by offering powerful speeches before trooping through the empty parliamentary “no” lobby. For the second time in as many weeks, Labour offered a vacuum in place of leadership against state-sanctioned violence against civilians. It has paid a profound moral price, and conceded yet more ground to its opponents.</p> <p>• Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",False,pillar/opinion,Opinion,"['gender-based violence', 'sexual assault', 'domestic violence']"

No one knew what I had just done. I was alone; alone with the weight of the world on my shoulders.”</p> <p>Because abortion is illegal in Gibraltar, no official services exist to provide women with the emotional support or practical aftercare they may need following the procedure. For Laura, the lack of medical support, combined with the silencing effect of stigma, made her experience all the more difficult.</p> <p>“I had a lot of pain and bleeding afterwards,” said Laura, who asked not to use her real name. “Because there is no after-support from the clinic and none in Gibraltar, I didn’t know if this was normal or not – I just had to guess.”</p> <p>The emotional impact and the sense of isolation often felt after an abortion are especially heightened in Gibraltar. The territory’s tiny population of around 34,000 means word travels fast and any shame felt is amplified. The majority of Gibraltarians identify as Roman Catholic – no small factor in the territory’s reluctance to change its stance on reproductive rights.</p> <p>Earlier this year, religious leaders in Gibraltar encouraged voters to oppose the law change, describing abortion as a “modern-day holocaust”.</p> <p>The statement – issued by a group of men – highlighted the religious conservatism that has for so long influenced politics on the tiny peninsula. Same-sex marriage was only legalised in 2016, and the morning-after pill only became available the year after – with both decisions facing resistance from the Catholic community.</p> <p>According to Marlene Hassan Nahon, leader of political party Together Gibraltar, personal views have no place in legislation.</p> <p>“The argument for me is very simple: you don’t have to be pro-abortion, you just have to be pro the healthcare legislation that lets women make their own choices,” she says. “Abortion will carry on happening, it’s not something we’re going to get rid of, so let’s just make sure that women are treated safely.”</p> <p>Activists say that until its people are given a referendum, Gibraltar will remain a place that does not allow women to make safe, supported choices about their own bodies and lives.</p> <p>“I made the most difficult decision I have ever made,” Rosalina says of her abortion. “And it was the right one. I left my abusive husband seven months later.</p> <p>“Three years after, and in another relationship, I had my daughter. And every time I look at her, I am reassured that I made the right decision.”",False,pillar/news,News,['forced abortion']

The channel <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/01/media/ed-henry-fired-fox-news/index.html"">fired its co-anchor</a> earlier this month after details of the complaint surfaced and says it received no sexual harassment claims against Henry prior to that.</p> <p>The suit also contains bombshell allegations raised by a second woman, Cathy Areu, who says she was sexually harassed by a slew of top personalities on the channel. They include the star anchor Sean Hannity, the controversial host <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jul/14/tucker-carlson-writer-resignation-blake-neff-fox-news-response"">Tucker Carlson</a> and the media commentator Howard Kurtz.</p> <p>The most serious allegations in the lawsuit relate to the former Fox Business Network associate producer Jennifer Eckhart. The suit accuses Henry of manipulating and grooming Eckhart when she was 24, asking her to be his “sex slave” and “little whore” and threatening her with retaliation if she did not comply.</p> <p>The suit alleges that Henry sexually assaulted her on Fox News property and raped her while she was helpless and restrained in metal handcuffs at a hotel used by the channel to lodge visiting employees.</p> <p>In its statement, Fox News said that Eckhart could pursue her claims directly with Henry “as Fox News already took swift action … and Mr Henry is no longer employed by the network”.</p> <p>Catherine Foti, Henry’s lawyer, said in a statement that “evidence in this case will demonstrate that Ms Eckhart initiated and completely encouraged a consensual relationship”. She said that Henry looked forward to presenting his own evidence including “graphic photos”.</p> <p>Eckhart said that she hoped her decision to file suit “will result in positive change for women at Fox, and for all victims in the workplace”.</p> <p>The complaint, drawn up by the prominent anti-discrimination lawyers Douglas Wigdor and Michael Willemin, also states that in March 2018 Hannity humiliated Areu, who was a regular guest on his show, while she was on set and in front of the entire studio crew.</p> <p>He allegedly threw $100 in cash on his desk on set and began exhorting men in the crew to take Areu out on a date to Del Friscos. “Who wants to take her on a date?” Hannity yelled, to her mortification, the lawsuit says.</p> <p>The suit reproduces a photograph of a stash of cash and a cigarette on a studio desk which it says was the money thrown down by Hannity as part of his misogynistic ruse.</p> <p>Areu also alleges in the lawsuit that in December 2018 Carlson, at the end of his Tucker Carlson Tonight show on which she had appeared, made suggestive comments to her, saying he would be staying alone in his hotel room without any wife or kids.</p> <p>“Without question, Mr Carlson was probing to see whether Ms Areu was interested in a sexual relationship,” the lawsuit contends, accusing the host of retaliating against the plaintiff when she declined his advances.</p> <p>A separate allegation of sexual harassment is raised by Areu against Kurtz from July 2019.</p> <p>In a statement released on Monday, Fox News said that it had conducted a “comprehensive independent investigation” by an outside law firm into Areu’s claims against Carlson, Hannity and Kurtz and found them to be “false, patently frivolous and utterly devoid of any merit”.</p> <p>Fox News has been bedevilled by allegations of sexual harassment against senior male figures for years and has been repeatedly accused of operating a work culture that tolerates sexual misconduct. The late Roger Ailes was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-leaves-fox-news-sexual-harassment-claims"">forced to resign</a> from the channel that he created in 2016 after 23 women accused him of sexual harassment.</p> <p>The lawsuit challenges the line put forward by Fox News that it has cleaned up its act since Ailes left. It says: “Fox News would have the public believe that it is a different place from the Fox News that was run by former disgraced Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes. Unfortunately, it is actually worse.”",False,pillar/news,News,"['rape', 'gang-rape', 'sexual assault']"

Shaun’s point, emphasised repeatedly, was that the only way to end domestic violence is to change the behaviour of men – exactly what women are saying, not to mention Sadiq Khan.</p> <p>“If Labour want to talk about the issues, then let’s start with Sadiq Khan’s admission that London isn’t safe for women and girls.

France’s Alice Finot split the two to take silver.</p> <p>Markovc, who was born in Stockport but moved to the US as a child, said afterwards she was thrilled to take gold – albeit in a weak field. “It’s difficult coming into your first championship and being nervous because you haven’t competed on the big stage before, but I wanted to take every opportunity,” she said.</p> <p>“I felt strong and I felt I needed to kick a bit earlier.

He bagged his first Munro, Ben Chonzie, with assistance from mum and dad, at the age of five, graduating to harder climbs like the South Glen Shiel Ridge as he entered his teens. His mother Kerry helped him to record his summits in a scrapbook: by the age of 16 he had a grand total of 40.</p> <p>Then came lockdown, and this active boy who swam in national competitions, found himself indoors and at bay, isolated from school friends, battling through exam coursework on a wonky internet connection at the home in rural Aberdeenshire he shared with Kerry, his father Adam, and younger brothers Torin, 13, and Glenn, 11.</p> <p>Over the summer and into the autumn, as Scottish restrictions eased then tightened again, Corey got out on his mountain bike with friends, swam in a few quarries, but something had changed. And a little more than two weeks ago, as his parents put it with a tone of untranslatable loss, “he slipped through our fingers”. The family returned from a brief afternoon outing to find that their eldest son had taken his own life.</p> <p>When Corey was cremated last Friday in Banchory, the streets were lined with mourners, many of them fellow pupils at the nearby academy. His death has convulsed the local community where, as Adam explains, “everybody knows”.</p> <p>The family have been embraced by friends and strangers alike: the swimming club is organising a meal rota, and a <a href=""https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/coreysedgefund"">crowdfunding appeal</a> set up by Kerry has amassed £26,000, much of this from anonymous donations, which they hope to split between the mental health charity Men Matters Scotland and an organisation working on the climate crisis, a cause Corey had become passionate about after watching Blue Planet.</p> <p>But alongside this comfort is the inevitable exposure of such a raw wound. A trip to the supermarket after the school run on the day has left Adam tearful: “You can just see people not knowing what to say and you just want to crawl into your shell.”</p> <p>This is how Torin describes it to Kerry when he explains why he can’t face going back to the school he attended with his older brother: “Too many people looking at me, too many asking me, just too much.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""2242ac2815adb490c7447a99a6867d1be24350a5""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/2242ac2815adb490c7447a99a6867d1be24350a5/0_0_3864_5152/750.jpg"" alt=""Corey Liversedge with his family."" width=""750"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Corey Liversedge (left) with his family, including parents Adam and Kerry.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Family Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Adam and Kerry, both teachers, are aware that speaking to the media results in further exposure. But Adam has chosen to speak to the Guardian at length because it is the newspaper he reads and “I wanted to reach other parents who share our values”.</p> <p>His message is simple enough: “Don’t put it down as just a teenage thing. Go for advice and help early. I’ll regret that ‘til the day I die.”</p> <p>He emphasises that Corey did not have a diagnosed mental illness. “It could be any child.”</p> <p>Adam describes in a jagged voice his visit to the police morgue, and looking through a pane of glass to identify his son. “The sympathetic police officer who stood close to us said ‘There’s been an increase this year’. If we can stop that happening to one other child then this will be worthwhile.”</p> <p>As a secondary school teacher, Kerry also wants to see more training in mental health first aid: “I know how to perform CPR but I need to know how to unlock what’s going on in those heads,” she says.</p> <p>Sometimes speaking across one another, shell-shocked witnesses to an indescribable catastrophe, they prompt one another’s memories as they attempt to patchwork some sense out of a shattering few weeks. “They all encouraged him to put Snapchat on to his phone but he didn’t want to.”</p> <p>“There were times when he’d stay in his room and not want to get up. There were times when he would skip a meal. Part of me thought it was teenage angst and part of me thought ‘it’s not right’. I did ask him: ‘Have you had dark thoughts?’, is how I put it, and he said: ‘No Mum I haven’t’.”</p> <p>“He opened up to you when I was off with the others,” Adam interjects. “He loved one-on-one time with mum,” Kerry agrees. She would make his favourite tea, spaghetti bolognese, and they would eat in on a tray while they watched a movie together.</p> <p>After the uncertainty about his National 5 exams – he was awarded 5As and 2Bs on his prelim results – Corey was finding the additional homework and testing for his higher courses stressful, but Kerry was always clear to him that there were alternatives if he didn’t want to continue at school.</p> <p>“I look at some of my students and I can see they are in a dark place and I try to say to them: who you are now isn’t who you will always be. Your potential is amazing and where you’re stuck now, you can move one step away from it and it will be different.”</p> <p>Kerry says: “I wish I’d said it more fervently to Corey. You feel like you’re a bad parent and you’ve done something, not maybe wrong but not right. That there’s something else we should have done. He knew we loved him, we told him often.”</p> <p>Both accept that they may never know exactly what happened to their son that Saturday. “I think that a dark place caught him and it overwhelmed him. Something overtook him and he slipped through our fingers. And like Adam, I will not forgive myself that we weren’t here.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=""mailto:jo@samaritans.org"">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=""mailto:jo@samaritans.ie"">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

This is why any attempt to remedy matters has to start with political reforms: ensuring that everyone entitled to vote can do so; having some form of proportional representation (so that minorities can be better represented); introducing state funding of political parties, to reduce the money power; and controlling the claims made in political communications.

On 27 October, the state <a href=""https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/data.htm#summary"">reported</a> more than 5,000 new cases and a test-positivity rate of over 27%. Nearly 2,000 people have died, and only the Dakotas are currently reporting more cases per capita.</p> <p>Despite this, Donald Trump has been holding large rallies across the state – three in the last week alone – where crowds gather by the thousands, often without masks. Another Trump rally is planned for Monday in Kenosha, the site of unrest last summer after Jacob Blake was shot in the back by police. Wisconsin is a crucial swing state in Tuesday’s election; Trump carried the state by just 27,000 votes in 2016 and is currently <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/31/us-election-polls-tracker-who-is-leading-in-swing-states-trump-or-biden"">trailing behind Joe Biden in the polls</a>.</p> <p>Last week, a group of 20 doctors sent an open letter to Donald Trump asking him to stop holding rallies in the state. On Thursday, the night before Trump was scheduled to appear in Green Bay, hospitals released a joint statement urging locals to avoid large crowds. Earlier this month, the Trump campaign scuttled plans for a rally in La Crosse, in western Wisconsin, after the city’s mayor asked him not to come amid a spike in cases there. </p> <p>Dr Kristin Lyerly, an Ob/Gyn who practices in Appleton, in eastern Wisconsin, said she struggles to find the right words to describe her anger over the rallies, which <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2020/10/22/trumps-campaign-made-stops-nationwide-then-coronavirus-cases-surged/3679534001/"">have been linked</a> to subsequent coronavirus outbreaks. Last week, at a rally in Waukesha, about 100 miles south of Appleton, Trump falsely accused healthcare workers of inflating the number of Covid cases for financial gain.</p> <p>“His lies are killing my neighbors,” she said.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Many of us were shocked that our legislature would put us in danger, and make us decide between our vote and our health</p> <footer> <cite>Kristin Lyerly</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lyerly, who is also running for state assembly, said she spends her days trying to reassure terrified pregnant patients, while fearing that she might contract the virus herself. She and her colleagues are overwhelmed. She keeps her PPE in her car to ensure she never goes without it. “We’ve completely forgotten about the human impact on our healthcare workers. Our healthcare workers are exhausted, they’re burned out and they feel entirely disrespected,” she said.</p> <p>Lyerly said she decided to run for office in April, after the Republican-controlled state assembly refused to postpone a statewide election, in which the Democratic presidential primary and a key state supreme court seat were on the ballot. The state GOP also stymied efforts to make it easier for Wisconsinites to vote by mail.</p> <p>“As a physician, I think many of us were shocked that our legislature would put us in danger, and make us decide between our vote and our health,” she said. She’s running in a district that typically leans conservative, but said that her campaign’s latest polls put her within the margin of error of her opponent, an incumbent.</p> <p>Dr Robert Freedland, an ophthalmologist in south-western Wisconsin and state lead for the Committee to Protect Medicare, signed the letter asking Trump to stop holding rallies in Wisconsin. He wanted to go on the record as having spoken out in the name of public health.</p> <p>Freedland, who is 65 and has type II diabetes, said he fears for his health when he goes to work. </p> <p>Dr Jeff Kushner, a cardiologist who also signed the letter, said he hasn’t been able to work since March due to the pandemic. Kushner, 65, has non-Hodgkins lymphoma and is on immunosuppressants. “If I got Covid, I wouldn’t survive,” he said.</p> <p>Though he follows politics closely, Kushner said he’s not “politically involved” and that he tends to keep his politics to himself and a close inner circle. But he said he doesn’t consider signing the letter to Trump a political act. “It’s a statement of what I believe about our society’s health and not a political statement,” he said. “It wasn’t an anti-Trump letter, we were just saying, ‘Please don’t have these super-spreader events in our state.’”</p> <p>Kapsner, the emergency room doctor in north-western Wisconsin, said he still speaks with patients and voters who doubt the severity of Covid-19. “My job isn’t to shame them,” he said. “There are many people out here who have had the good fortune of not being personally affected by Covid.

The force said a hearing date had yet to be set “but will be expedited as quickly as possible”.</p> <p>A statement said: “Given the forthcoming hearing, it would not be appropriate at this stage to go into further detail about the allegations which are still being finalised in terms of breaches of standards of professional behaviour.</p> <p>“The MPS takes all allegations of domestic abuse extremely seriously and it is right and proper that the full circumstances of this case should be considered at a hearing.

The series starts in the summer of 1993, when James Jordan went missing for three weeks before his body was discovered in a South Carolina creek. Jordan was believed to have been shot to death as he napped on the side of a North Carolina highway while driving home from a funeral in the small hours of 23 July.</p> <p>Jordan’s corpse was so badly decomposed the South Carolina coroner tagged him a John Doe and saved his hands and jaw for future identification. His red Lexus SC400, found destroyed in North Carolina some 60 miles from his body, was stolen along with money and personal effects that included a pair of NBA rings – gifts from Michael, of course. Car phone records eventually led a two-state, tri-county investigation to two teenage friends with rap sheets: Daniel Green, a black man, and Larry Demery, a Native American. James Jordan was just days away from his 57th birthday.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/24/michael-jordan-was-years-ahead-of-his-game-the-last-dance-showed-that-he-still-is"">Michael Jordan was years ahead of his game.

It shook me: a 13-year-old Bulls-mad, Chicago native whose <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/20/the-last-dance-espn-lebron-james-michael-jordan-nba"">fierce loyalty to MJ</a> traced to a father who had made sport of taking me trawling around the Near West Side blocks surrounding Chicago Stadium for second-hand tickets on school nights. For the better part of that summer, it seemed, there was no more pressing news story in Chicagoland than the murder of James Jordan – even as fresh cases cropped up around town daily. We all knew what James meant to Michael because Michael meant so much to us. Hell, we had just seen them <a href=""https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mj-pic5517-copy-1589217399.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.184xw,0&amp;resize=980:*"">toweling champagne off each other</a> inside a jubilant Bulls locker room after sealing the first three-peat. <em>We</em> took it personally.</p> <p>But when MJ suddenly convened a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IATBa_K0mgE"">world-stopping retirement news conference</a> months after striking gold with the Dream Team in Barcelona, local despair over his father’s killing was quickly forgotten. When Michael further set his mind to playing professional baseball – something his dad had always wanted to see him try – well, that didn’t just quash local curiosity in James Jordan’s sad end; it gave NBA fans permission to run wild with conspiracy theories about the killing and Michael’s retirement being gambling related. Michael’s public reluctance to dwell on his father’s murder only made it easier for the rest of us to traffic in rumor and innuendo when we weren’t fiendishly tracking MJ’s minor-league batting average or foolishly pinning hopes of a four-peat on Scottie Pippen playing nice with Tony Kukoc – all storylines that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSPo7lPyAlc"">have</a> <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1509848/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"">been</a> <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8420184/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"">unpacked</a> in documentaries, by the by.</p> <p>Moment of Truth director Matthew Perniciaro, who reached out to the Jordan family in the early stages of his project and was respectfully turned down, can relate. Like me, he was a teenage Jordan fan in the 90s. “As a kid growing up in North Carolina at that time, there was this extra degree of pride because he was from the same place,” he says. But, unlike me, Perniciaro never lost sight of the real tragedy. “The Jordan family is so beloved in North Carolina. The case, the murder of James Jordan, was reported on way more heavily here than it was on a national level. And because of that, I had a huge awareness of the story for the majority of my life. It’s probably the most well-known criminal case in North Carolina history.”</p> <p>On the books, the final legal decision reads like a blowout victory for the state. Demery and Green were pitted against each other. Demery flipped. His confessions under interrogation and on the witness stand not only pinned the whole scheme – killing included – on his accomplice, but painted him a sadistic reveler.

The documentary cannonballs into the history of North Carolina’s Robeson county, the trial venue and a majority-minority county with deep divides along black and Native American lines; a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robeson_County,_North_Carolina#/media/File:Robeson_County_Courthouse,_Lumberton_North_Carolina.jpg"">massive confederate monument</a> stands sentinel on the county courthouse steps. We’re introduced to scene-chewing good ol’ boys like Johnson Britt, the straight-arrow DA hellbent on winning his biggest ever case; and Hubert Stone, the grandstanding county sheriff whose out-of-wedlock son – Hubert Larry Deese – was a convicted drug trafficker with apparent ties to Demery; Deese’s number was among the first to pop up on the car phone log. How was <em>that</em> not grist for the worldwide conspiracy mill?</p> <p>But the people you’ll most likely feel for most – apart from the Jordan family, of course – are Green, a too-familiar, bright-but-neglected type whose biggest crime might well have been a perverse loyalty to Demery; and Christine Mumma, the innocence attorney who went as far as running for state attorney general to help Green’s cause – only to have her exoneration record used against her in 2020’s Republican primary.</p> <p>That’s the thing about this documentary: the deeper it looks into the past, the more it seems to hold a mirror to the present. “I’ve always viewed James Jordan’s murder and the case and the convictions in the trial and everything that takes place afterwards as a gateway into a larger story about our society and specifically about corruption in law enforcement and systemic racism and the criminal justice system,” Perniciaro says. “As we as were making the series, it was really sobering and difficult trying to process how little progress has been made in 30 years.”</p> <p>What’s more, the story doesn’t end after episode five. Demery was granted parole last summer and is scheduled to be released in August 2023. Green, who has long maintained his innocence and failed in his attempts to get a new trial, is eligible for parole in October. If anything, the plot is thickening. But through forensic reporting and an unerring focus, Moment of Truth at least takes the idea of James Jordan’s murder as a mere character-building subplot to the larger Michael Jordan mythos and thoroughly lays that to rest.",False,pillar/sport,Sport,"['honor killing', 'woman+murder']"

Complaints came from male and female students, many still teenagers. One alleged being told “a blow job would be a good start” if they wanted to please their tutor. The Academy did not comment on the allegations at the time.</p> <p>The complaints were first leaked to classical music blog Slipped Disc following the suspension of the school’s then head of opera, Gareth Hancock. Hancock also worked as an opera director and was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/23/glyndebourne-opera-director-sacked-for-inappropriate-text"">sacked by Glyndebourne opera company</a> last November for sending inappropriate texts to a singer he had been training. Students alleged they had faced a “blank wall” in getting their complaints taken seriously. Following damaging press coverage, the academy announced it was launching an independent investigation into its safeguarding policies and procedures.</p> <p>Almost a year later, the review chaired by Professor Peter Kopelman, University of London’s president of development, found “a widespread culture among conservatoire students of the fear of ‘speaking out’ that appears to stem from the belief that powerful individuals have the potential to adversely influence opportunities for those in the music profession”.</p> <p>While the school’s principal Jonathan Freeman-Attwood was praised for his “close knowledge and concern for the students”, the academy was criticised for underestimating its responsibilities to the wellbeing of its students, who pay up to £15,950 per year in fees (rising to £30,550 per year for international students) to attend.</p> <p>Kopelman reported that “students and many staff reported that they were uncertain of the senior management’s stance on safeguarding. It was perceived by some as reactive as opposed to proactive; this risks an impression that a main driver, on occasions, may be reputational damage limitation rather than the wellbeing of those involved.”</p> <p>The review was scathing of “inconsistencies in the recruitment and appointment of staff” at the academy, which prides itself for a reputation of setting standards of international excellence in classical music training.</p> <p>It recommended that the academy embrace a culture of openness and transparency and made clear that: “No one should be invited into a teaching relationship without proper background scrutiny and reference checks. Within the contract, the academy should set out its expectations on conduct, including reference to the formal code of conduct.”</p> <p>Despite the complaints, the academy confirmed that no disciplinary action has been taken against any teaching staff since last November. After Hancock’s resignation, the school appointed Brenda Hurley as its new head of opera. </p> <p>A Royal Academy of Music spokesperson told the <em>Observer</em>: “The safeguarding review was conducted to look at procedures in general and was not triggered by a specific incident or claim.”</p> <p>Following the review, the academy confirmed that no contracts will be subject to review or terminated as a result of the safeguarding exercise, but that it was committing to “review, simplify and strengthen some of our pastoral care offering”. </p> <p>Lobby organisation<a href=""https://1752group.com/"" title=""""> </a><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/13/universities-traumatise-student-sexual-misconduct-survivors-by-mishandling-cases"">The 1752 Group</a>, which is working to end staff-to-student sexual misconduct in higher education, said the recommendations were “a good start” but criticised the report’s lack of focus on gender inequalities. “This is particularly important in classical music,” a spokesperson said, “where there is a culture of celebrating male authority, and any awareness of the gender, race or other inequalities that enable harassment to occur are seen as peripheral to the music itself.”</p> <p>A spokesperson from the academy’s governing body said: “We warmly welcome this review. This is exactly the guidance we require to hold ourselves to the very highest standards in this critical area.”",False,pillar/news,News,"['sexual assault', 'sexual abuse']"

In real life, the answer is probably yes, though how would we know about it? Perfection demands that the murder be unsolvable, maybe even unrecorded – a victim disappearing off the face of the earth, a body never found, a killer never caught. In our world of forensic science and DNA evidence, the perfect murder must be as rare as a reclusive celebrity.<br><br>But we have fiction, and this is where we find an abundance of perfect murder attempts. I say attempts because the allure of most detective fiction hinges on the existence of an investigator – a Holmes, a Poirot, a Lisbeth Salander – who is smarter than the smartest of criminals. The perfect murder – like a perfect sonnet or a perfect roast chicken – is an ideal that can be approached but never entirely reached. Detectives, and storytelling tradition, get in the way.<br><br>When I set out to write a book in which a bookseller publishes a blog about his favourite fictional murders, only to find out that someone else is using the list as a blueprint for real crimes, I knew that part of the process of writing was going to be a whole lot of reading. So I set out to find a definitive list of perfect crimes and came up with a final tally of eight (or rather, my narrator Malcolm Kershaw did).</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Christie\'s use of thallium as a fatal poison in The Pale Horse caused a brief uptick in the toxin’s presence in real-life crime</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Those eight books include Strangers on a Train, Patricia Highsmith’s venomous debut, which suggests the road to getting away with murder is for two killers to swap over their victims; Anthony Berkeley Cox’s <a href=""https://mysteriesahoy.com/2018/05/04/malice-aforethought-by-francis-iles/"">Malice Aforethought</a>, practically a how-to guide for poisoning a spouse; and Donna Tartt’s chilly tale of undergraduate murder, The Secret History, in which a tight-knit group of classics majors dispatch one of their own.<br><br>What did I learn from making this list? That perfect murders, at least the artful kind we find in books, are all about concealment and misdirection. They have a lot in common with well-executed magic: it’s all about fooling the detectives (and the readers), making us look away from where the crime is happening. Agatha Christie’s The ABC Murders, another book on Malcolm’s list, is a textbook example: it appears as though a psychopath is bumping off victims according to the initials of their names, but the truth is something else altogether. Poirot, naturally, is not misled, and the world can be set to rights.<br><br>I could have included many more Christie novels on the list – she is, after all, the undisputed master of the ingenious murder plot. And she loved misdirection. My favourite is Death on the Nile, in which the murderer(s) make sure that a witness sees something that doesn’t really happen. Or think of The Mousetrap, her West End play that may yet run for ever (it’s currently clocking in at 68 years), in which a gun shows up in the hand of the last person the audience expects.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""ed9cbee2fdd45edd046bd145248ad7882afe56d9""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/ed9cbee2fdd45edd046bd145248ad7882afe56d9/0_182_3504_2102/1000.jpg"" alt=""OSAMUND PIKE Character(s): Amy Dunne Film ‘GONE GIRL’ (2014) Directed By DAVID FINCHER"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Who’s in the frame? David Fincher’s 2014 film of Gone Girl.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Allstar/New Regency Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are modern masters of misdirection, as well. Gillian Flynn created an iconic villain (or hero, depending on your point of view) with Amy Dunne, the star of Gone Girl. The brilliance of Amy was that she’d had a lifetime of duplicity behind her. Not just as a child, starring in her parents’ series of Amazing Amy girl-empowerment books, but as a young woman in the dating arena, transforming herself into the mythical “cool girl”. So when it comes to framing her husband for her own murder, she is able to mislead an entire nation. Fake news as a spurned wife’s revenge.<br><br>Unless you are a reader who studiously avoids anything on the darker end of the pop-culture spectrum, then you are, like me, spoilt for choice with delicious murder stories. The bestseller list has been filled for years now with “girls” who are victims, victimisers, witnesses, or some combination of all three. On TV streaming services, one could binge almost infinitely in the dark realms of a police procedural. Pick a location – northern England, any Scandinavian country, the American city – and the evil options seem endless.<br><br>Lately, there is a very definite trend for murderers who get away with it. Highsmith got there first, offering up Tom Ripley in five books filled with his unsolved crimes. Nowadays, just in the realm of TV, we have Dexter, the serial killer who hunts his own kind, and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/aug/27/hannibal-finale-bryan-fuller-best-show-on-tv"">the cut-off-in-its-prime Hannibal</a>, an artful, imaginative riff on the world of Thomas Harris’s Hannibal Lecter. Then there’s Ruth Wilson’s sly performance as Alice Morgan on Luther, stealing the limelight from Idris Elba, and Jody Comer’s brilliant assassin in Killing Eve, adding a sense of humour to the killing game.<br><br>So much murder, so much of it committed with artful perfectionism – so much so that crime fiction has been used as a blueprint for real-life murderers. In 1961, when Christie published The Pale Horse (an adaptation of which <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m000f9xw/the-pale-horse/"">is on BBC iPlayer</a>), thallium was a relatively unknown element. Its use as a fatal poison in this mystery story, and its description by the author as an effective tool for the removal of human beings, caused a brief uptick in the toxin’s presence in real-life crime. Graham Young, a serial poisoner, began experimenting with thallium right around the time of the publication of The Pale Horse, and it was alleged that he’d been inspired by Christie’s novel. I’m sure this was less than comforting news for Christie, although it might have been balanced out by the fact that the popularity of her book also saved at least one life when a nurse, who was a mystery fan, correctly diagnosed thallium poisoning in a young boy based on reading the book. <br><br>I was recently asked if I’d keep a really foolproof idea for a murder to myself. I was unsure of the implication. Did the interviewer want to know if I’d keep it out of the hands of a potential real-life criminal, or would I be keeping it to myself for possible practical application in the future (a particularly harsh book critic, maybe)? Regardless, my answer is a resounding no.</p> <p>If I came up with a good juicy murder idea (and I like to think I’ve managed a few), then I would most certainly include it in a book. Because the truth is that the vast majority of us, readers and writers alike, know the difference between fiction and reality. It’s a truth that Edgar Allan Poe was well aware of when he wrote one of the first examples of a perfect murder in The Tell-Tale Heart. No matter how well you plan your murder, how perfect you make it, a human heart has stopped beating. If the police don’t find you, something else – guilt, karma, madness – almost certainly will. Nothing’s perfect.</p> <p>• Peter Swanson’s novel <a href=""https://www.faber.co.uk/catalog/product/view/id/7548/s/9780571342358-rules-for-perfect-murders/category/165/"">Rules for Perfect Murders is published by Faber</a>.",False,pillar/arts,Arts,['honor killing']

The new tougher restrictions will likely have to remain place until there has been greater vaccine rollout which could take months. At the current juncture, we are working on the assumption that vaccines will still prove effective against the new strain but it is not yet clear. As a result, the economic slowdown willprove deeper and extend further into nextyear. It will dampen optimism over a stronger economic recovery in 2021. <br></p> </blockquote> <p>Negative interest rates could be tested by the Bank of England as it scrambles to find more ways of stimulating the economy, Hardman added.<br></p> <p><strong>Richard Hunter</strong>, head of markets at <strong>interactive investor</strong>, said the UK’s break from Europe is becoming “increasingly physical as well as conceptual”. The next few days - usually very thin in terms of trading activity - could be bumpy on financial markets, he said:<br></p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>With some cases also being reported outside of the UK and with several countries suffering fresh spikes in cases and resorting to further lockdowns, the stark reminder is that until the vaccine rollout reaches a sufficient level, little can be done to defeat the virus.</p> </blockquote> <p>Against this backdrop, investors are far less likely to commit fresh capital to the market, especially in the last few trading days of the year.</p> <p>However, here is a dose of (very tempered) optimism from <strong>Paul Donovan</strong>, chief economist at <strong>UBS Global Wealth Management</strong> that it won’t be too much worse. He said: </p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p> Much of Europe has become cut off from the UK, following details of a new strain of the virus. The near-term economic effects of this are, perhaps, limited - inventories tend to be high at this time of the year, and the UK has imposed more restrictions on activity. However, this does signal a relatively high degree of fear, and it is fear of the virus that does the most economic damage. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-5fe05b958f08c00122debb49"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2020-12-21T08:30:52.515Z"">8.30am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>Bucking the trend on London’s stock market this morning is Metro Bank, which gained as much as 22% (before moderating to a 7.8% gain) after investors priced in Friday’s announcement of a £3bn mortgage book sale to NatWest Group, the old RBS.</strong></p> <p>Also on the up are gold miners - a safe haven in times of trouble - such as Fresnillo, up 5% this morning.

Kenneth Branagh, Adrian Lester, David Morrissey and Daisy Ridley star in Tracy-Ann Oberman’s new play that recreates the behind-the-scenes drama.</p> <p>“The play is a page turner, where an explosive moment in history resonates powerfully with our own,” Branagh told the <em>Observer</em>. “The surface is the off-screen drama of a famous film. What lies beneath is a more fundamental story of prejudice.”</p> <p>Branagh plays Spencer Tracy, the double Oscar-winning actor who was in the final stages of terminal illness during filming and it had been touch and go throughout as to whether he would be able to complete the shoot.</p> <p>“Wrapped around the last days of a cinema legend,” said Branagh, “it was sometimes hard to see what the ailing Spencer Tracy hated most; the discrimination that his character rails against, or himself.”</p> <p>The actor died 17 days after filming finished at the age of 67. Alongside him was Hepburn, his great love for 26 years and one of the biggest names in cinema.</p> <p>The question of “the colour bar” dividing America had prompted Kramer to attempt to make a contribution witty enough to become mainstream entertainment. At the time racial turbulence across the land was being mirrored in the supreme court, where judges were hearing the controversial “inter-racial marriage” case, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jul/13/loving-trailer-joel-edgerton-ruth-negga-video"" title="""">Loving </a><em><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jul/13/loving-trailer-joel-edgerton-ruth-negga-video"" title="""">v</a></em><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jul/13/loving-trailer-joel-edgerton-ruth-negga-video"" title=""""> Virginia</a>.</p> <p>Until the summer of 1967, six months before the film was released, marriage between black and white people was still illegal in many American states.

She is not alone.</p> <p>Rape survivors are among those voicing deep concerns about the stigma and ensuing “mask rage” attached to not wearing a face covering in shops, on transport and in other public places, prompting <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/01/mask-face-coverings-i-cant-wear-one-health-reasons"">calls for better recognition</a> of legitimate reasons why people are exempt.</p> <p>A number of rape and sexual abuse survivors have told the charity Rape Crisis they are so scared of being confronted and verbally abused for not wearing face masks that they are avoiding places where they may be challenged.</p> <p>“A significant proportion of rape survivors had their mouths or noses covered, or were choked or smothered, as part of the abuse and violence they experienced,” said Kate Russell, the national spokesperson for Rape Crisis England and Wales. “Covering their face and nose now can trigger flashbacks, panic attacks and severe anxiety.”</p> <p>Severe distress is recognised by the government as a reason for a <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-%0A%0Amake-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#when-you-%0A%0Ado-not-need-to-wear-a-face-covering"">legal exemption</a> from the mandatory use of face coverings. But rape victims still fear they will be castigated.</p>  <figure class=""element element-embed"" data-alt=""Callout callout-coronavirus"">  <iframe class=""fenced"" srcdoc=""&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;""></iframe> </figure>  <p>Russell said: “There’s a lot of assumptions that people who aren’t wearing face masks are behaving that way because they’re selfish, stupid, careless or a combination of all three. This lack of awareness is creating legitimate anxiety among rape survivors that if they go out and about they might not be met with empathy and care.”</p> <p>Fallows, a 29-year-old solicitor, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and cannot bear to have her mouth covered, years after her experience of rape.</p> <p>“For part of my rape, he had his hand over my mouth. As a result, anything over my mouth – even an oxygen mask – can trigger a flashback. And that is hugely distressing. Physically, it feels like I’m back there again and he’s raping me and I am dying,” she said.</p> <p>The distress she suffers amid flashbacks can be so severe that paramedics have felt it necessary to call the police to hold her down so they can sedate her. “It’s absolutely horrendous. I would like to be able to wear a mask, not just for my own health, but because I don’t want to make other people feel uncomfortable. But even the thought of putting on a mask makes me very, very, very panicky.”</p> <p>When she tried to get her hair cut after lockdown, another customer interrogated her about her lack of a mask, refusing to accept Fallows’ reply that she was exempt.</p> <p>“She told me that was ridiculous and said I had no proof. I cried all the way home. She truly believed that I was a self-centred, ignorant girl who didn’t give a shit about anybody else. I felt completely worthless.”</p> <p>Since then, whenever she has tried to go to an enclosed public space without a mask, she has been challenged. She is now avoiding all shops and public transport which, since she has no car, is severely restricting where she can go. “I can’t see my family, who live two hours away. If I want to go anywhere, I have to walk.”</p> <p>She fears this could leave her vulnerable to another attack – she was dragged off the street by her rapist – and so spends a lot of time alone in her bedroom. “I’ve tried so hard to rejoin life again, as it were. But it feels like it has all been taken away again.”</p> <p>She contacted her MP, local councillor and mayor to urge them to mount a public awareness campaign about the legitimate reasons for mask exemptions, but received no response.</p> <p>She has waived her right to anonymity to raise awareness. “People feel like they have the right to challenge you, and that is awful. You wouldn’t look at me and know I’d been raped, but I was, and it’s a huge problem for me. I spend most of my time trying to forget what happened to me. I don’t need to be challenged about this three or four times a day, just trying to live my life. All it does is remind me of something I’m desperately trying to forget.”</p> <p>Rape Crisis wants shops and public transport companies to display signs and remind customers there are legitimate reasons people may not be wearing masks, which may not always be visible or obvious, and discourage customers from challenging each other.</p> <p>The Oxfordshire Sexual Abuse and Rape Crisis Centre has compiled a <a href=""https://www.osarcc.org.uk/coping-with-a-face-covering-as-a-survivor-of-sexual-violence/"">list</a> of ways in which some survivors of sexual violence have found it possible to wear face coverings.</p> <p>“The list offers support and advice for survivors around face coverings and how they can perhaps make the experience of wearing a face covering less traumatic,” said Russell. She urged any survivor who is distressed or concerned about wearing a face mask to get in touch with Rape Crisis nationally or a local service.",False,pillar/news,News,"['rape', 'gang-rape']"

She is best known for <a href=""https://guardianbookshop.com/parallel-lives-9781911547525.html"" title=""""><em>Parallel Lives</em></a>, her acclaimed study of Victorian marriage as seen through the relationships of five literary couples including Effie Gray and John Ruskin, and Catherine Hogarth and Charles Dickens. The book is being reissued in a new edition with an introduction by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/25/sheila-heti-motherhood-interview"" title="""">Sheila Heti</a>.</p> <p><strong><em>Parallel Lives</em> first came out in </strong><strong>1983</strong><strong>. What’s your relationship with it now?</strong><br>I’m astonished by it. I’m very proud of the girl who wrote it. It’s miraculous that this girl knew so much, and was able to write so wittily.</p> <p><strong>Does that girl strike you as having been unnervingly wise?</strong><br>“Unnerving” is a good word for it. I can’t tell you where that wisdom came from, except that the magic of biographical writing is that you get out of yourself: you’re up in the clouds, looking down on people. You get a distance that isn’t available to you in terms of looking at your own life.</p> <p><strong>How did the idea for the book come to you?</strong><br>I had two models. The first was Lytton Strachey’s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/16/100-best-nonfiction-books-no-50-eminent-victorians-lytton-strachey-manning-nightingale-arnold-gordon"" title=""""><em>Eminent Victorians</em></a>. The second was Diane Johnson’s book <a href=""http://movies2.nytimes.com/books/00/04/16/specials/johnson-lesser.html"" title=""""><em>Lesser Lives</em></a>, which was a biography of the first Mrs George Meredith, Mary Ellen Peacock. That was very important for me: the idea that there was someone there in the room [with a great writer], whose life was as important to her as his was to him. I’d written my PhD on Dickens, but it was never published. But I knew a lot about Victorian writers. The material sat in my mind, and then the early feminist movement gave me the point, which was to look at the structures which shape women’s lives.</p> <p><strong>Was it immediately apparent which couples you would write about?</strong><br>Everything about the book seemed to fall into place. Jane Carlyle [best known for her letters, she married the historian Thomas Carlyle in 1826; they became a famously unhappy couple] was tremendously appealing to me, so I began with them. I wrote about their courtship and that gave me the book’s structure: for each couple, I would write about a different stage of their relationship. Effie and John Ruskin, for instance, were my newlyweds, and the Dickenses I wrote about in middle age. With each essay, then, I knew where to start, and where to stop.</p> <p><strong>I think George Eliot and George Henry Lewes are the beating heart of the book…</strong><br></p> <p>You might be right. Each couple reminded me of people I knew in real life. George Eliot reminded me of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/06/the-abundance-by-annie-dillard-review"" title="""">Annie Dillard</a> [the Pulitzer prize-winning writer], who lived round the corner from me: her moral seriousness, her slight disconnection from the world. George Eliot the writer wouldn’t have existed without Lewes. He was one of those men who are proud of their wives, and are willing to put themselves at their service.<strong> </strong></p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Women are used to talking about other people’s behaviour. Men don’t do that, and they’re a little morally dull</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>People like to say: oh, the Victorians were more like us than you think. But they really were very weird, weren’t they?</strong><br>Absolutely, and that was a gift for me. Our culture has made us very different. They were pre-Freudian, so they weren’t self-conscious about expressing themselves. Look at Dickens. When he tired of Catherine, he just said: it’s my wife’s fault. No one could get away with that now. These days, Catherine would be represented by [the high-powered women’s rights lawyer] <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/dec/23/gloria-steinem-meets-gloria-allred-prince-andrew"" title="""">Gloria Allred</a> or something.</p> <p><strong>Does it worry you that people are currently so unwilling to separate art and life, with the result that writers like Dickens are in danger of being “cancelled”?</strong><br>Yes. I try never to forget that men like Ruskin or Dickens, who were naughty or sick or cruel, produced things that affected people for generations. You don’t want to slap the hand of a genius – at least, I don’t. The worst reaction to <em>Parallel Lives </em>is when people say: I used to read Dickens with pleasure, but I won’t any more, because of how he treated his wife. It is disappointing, and incredibly small-minded. These people are looking for reasons to dismiss writers. They won’t see the bigger picture. It upsets me that while people still associate Ruskin with this mythology over the pubic hair [the story goes that Ruskin did not consummate his marriage to Effie Gray because he was disgusted by the sight of her pubic hair], no one ever sits down and reads <em>Modern Painters</em> or <em>Praeterita</em> [his autobiography], or even looks at his watercolours, which are astonishing.</p> <p><strong>In the prologue to <em>Parallel Lives</em>, you say that gossip is the beginning of moral inquiry. Do you stand by that?</strong><br>Yes, I think that’s true. It’s the reason that women in general have finer sensibilities than men. They’re used to talking about other people’s behaviour. Men don’t do that, and they’re a little morally dull.</p> <p><strong>Is biography just high-class gossip?</strong><br>I feel that it’s an art form, but also that it’s never definitive. When I was writing about Virginia Woolf in 1979, her nephew Quentin Bell was about to publish his own book about her. I was anxious. It seemed to me that what I had to say about her – which had to do with the fact that being a woman was central to the way she saw life – was so obvious that he would say the same thing. But though he wrote a great book, he didn’t see that, and I was so happy and relieved.</p> <p><strong>You also say in your prologue that human beings invoke love at moments when they want to disguise transactions, like marriage, that involve power. Do you still see marriage like that?</strong><br>Women may be less inclined now to be hoodwinked by romantic folderol. But power still resides in marriage, and the stuff about weddings is still incredibly potent, which is why it gets Instagrammed. That’s part of the cover-up.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>What are you working on now?</strong><br>A book about the relationship between the Jesuit priest and geologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin [1881-1955], and an American woman in Paris who was married to a communist. It’s about friendships that begin in erotic attraction, but don’t end there…</p> <p><em>• Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages </em>by Phyllis Rose is published by Daunt Books (£10.99).

Nine in 10 had experienced higher levels of anxiety and stress levels during the latest lockdown.</p> <p>O’Grady said: “Women have been put in an impossible situation during the pandemic – often expected to work and look after children at the same time.</p> <p>“If ministers don’t act, women will be pushed out of the labour market. And that means women’s and children’s poverty will soar.”</p> <p>Victoria Benson, the CEO of Gingerbread, a charity for single parents, said she welcomed and supported the report’s findings.</p> <p>She said 90% of the UK’s 2 million single parents were women and they had “consistently been left behind” <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jan/08/uk-covid-school-closures-mean-mothers-will-take-twice-as-much-unpaid-leave-as-fathers-poll"">during the pandemic</a>.</p> <p>She said: “We have heard from many that they have reached the point where they’ve used all the paid and unpaid leave they can and so have no choice but to leave their jobs.</p> <p>“If this continues, single parents will be shut out of the labour market. This will have a devastating impact on families and push many more into poverty. The government must not leave single parents and their children out in the cold.”</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “Throughout the pandemic this government has done whatever it takes to protect lives and livelihoods, and will continue to do so. We are safeguarding people’s jobs and incomes with economic schemes worth over £200bn, including the self-employment income scheme for the 1.7 million self-employed women in the UK.</p> <p>“Covid-19 is prompting a culture shift with more people than ever before working flexibly, and the government wants to harness that as we recover. By doing so, we could see more equal sharing of care work by parents, and more flexibility from employers, enabling us to unleash the potential of everyone across the country.”",False,pillar/news,News,['gender-based violence']

That gesture of confident camaraderie now feels quaint as EU countries tie themselves in knots over a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/24/germany-frustration-grows-sluggish-rollout-covid-vaccines-falling-behind-uk"">bungled vaccine rollout</a>. Each week seems to bring a new setback in the jab plans, with delivery delays, safety scares and flubbed administration all combining to slow down the EU’s overall programme.</p> <p>Vaccination rates across the EU are a fraction of those in Britain, and way behind where the bloc had hoped to be at this stage. The EU has jabbed just <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations"">13 out of 100 people</a> while Britain’s equivalent figure is 45, and the US is on 38. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, still says that <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_21_1222"">70% of adults</a> can be fully vaccinated by the end of summer, but at this pace it will be well into 2022 when the EU reaches its target.</p> <p>As EU leaders gather on Thursday for another summit to figure their way out of their mess, officials have lighted on a new wheeze to help them speed up the process: <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/mar/23/eu-expand-criteria-used-decide-block-covid-vaccine-shipments"">controlling vaccine exports</a><strong> </strong>to countries like Britain and the US. “We want to see reciprocity and proportionality in exports, and we are ready to use whatever tool we need to deliver on that,” said Von der Leyen.</p> <p>There is brutal simplicity in the logic. The EU has so far <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_1121"">exported 34m Covid-19 vaccine doses</a>, including 10m to the UK, whose smug triumphalism about its rollout has an added sting in the already febrile post-Brexit era. These numbers have incensed people across the EU as they imagine the bloc leaching doses to everyone else. One official warned that the bloc shouldn’t be the pandemic’s “<a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/48b28b7e-9161-47a4-9c37-cf89fea2bc12"">useful idiot</a>” while others hoard and hide vaccines.</p> <p>Britain does not export any vaccines, and it craftily wrote <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/24/uk-singled-out-for-failing-to-export-covid-vaccines-to-eu"">clauses into its contract</a> with the vaccine manufacturer AstraZeneca to be served ahead of everyone else. As for the US, it prioritises domestic orders by drawing on the 70-year-old Defence Production Act, granting it extraordinary powers over manufacturing in times of crisis. Why can’t the EU also use the tools at its disposal?</p> <p>The argument for a more assertive EU policy gets louder when the travails with AstraZeneca are raised. The Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant has only delivered 30m of its promised 120m doses, and yet continues to provide uninterrupted supply to Britain, even sourcing from plants in the EU.</p> <p>The case, however, becomes a little murkier when other aspects of the EU’s vaccine rollout, which have little to do with exports, are considered. Crucially the EU was too slow to commit itself to suppliers last year. When it did, the joint €2.7bn pot to secure 2.3bn doses was too low – the US had a purse of $18bn for its Operation Warp Speed vaccine programme.</p> <p>The EU also spent too much time haggling over the wrong issues, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/27/eu-vaccine-bust-up-astrazeneca"">like pricing and liabilities</a>, rather than supply and timing, a misplaced strategy that even the unabashed federalist MEP <a href=""https://euobserver.com/stakeholders/150931"">Guy Verhofstadt calls “a fiasco”.</a> The EU approach now looks naive. Last year’s scramble was not a buyer’s market. Speed was of the essence as countries vied for priority access in the vaccine queue.</p> <p>These hitches go some way to explaining why the EU was already behind when it finally began its rollout last December.</p> <p>A number of European countries also face much higher levels of vaccine scepticism, feeding the risk-averse regulatory approach. Anti-vaxxer sentiment is particularly hostile to the AstraZeneca jab, with millions of doses now lying unused in storage.</p> <p>Earlier this month, concerns of a link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots led to many countries briefly pausing its use, before the European Medicines Agency declared that its benefits outweighed its risks. A recent <a href=""https://yougov.co.uk/topics/international/articles-reports/2021/03/22/europeans-now-see-astrazeneca-vaccine-unsafe-follo"">survey by YouGov</a> showed that fewer than half of Spaniards, Italians, French and Germans thought the vaccine was safe. Ironically, the EU thundering for a fair share of AstraZeneca jabs comes as fewer Europeans actually want it.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/21/eu-export-ban-would-delay-uk-covid-vaccine-drive-by-two-months"">EU export ban would delay UK Covid vaccine drive by two months</a> </p> </aside>  <p>AstraZeneca is hardly helping with its confusing efficiency data. The EU’s caution was mirrored in the US this week, whose <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/23/us-health-agency-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-trial-data"">watchdog suggested</a> AstraZeneca was cherrypicking trial data. The company needs to be clearer about the millions of doses produced at the Helix plant in the Netherlands or the Anagni plant in Italy. The debacle over <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/24/astrazeneca-dismisses-claim-29m-vaccine-doses-in-italy-were-bound-for-uk"">29m doses</a> at the Italian factory show how fraught things have become on all sides.</p> <p>This explains the context for the European commission’s plans to curb vaccine exports, targeting companies and countries that officials say are not playing fair. It rests on an understandable exasperation about the state of the vaccine rollout and a sense that Europeans are being played by devious countries.</p> <p>But an export ban would be a ham-fisted response to an already wretched predicament. The EU has been complacent, but it should also own its missteps and find better ways to redress the situation.</p> <p>Vaccines have complex raw-material supply chains, and some come from the countries the EU is targeting, like Britain. An export ban may at best gain about a week for the EU, but at worst, it would spark a tit-for-tat retaliation, hurting everyone. This week Micheál Martin, Ireland’s taoiseach, <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/absolutely-vital-to-keep-vaccine-supply-chains-open-martin-says-1.4516787"">described such</a> an approach as retrograde: “Once you start putting up barriers, other people start putting up barriers globally.” Pfizer’s vaccine needed 280 materials from 86 suppliers in 19 countries, he said.</p> <p>Instead of blame-shifting, the EU should focus on improving domestic production.

Will anyone get out alive? For the first 10 minutes, I wasn’t sure. The parody felt broad, the jokes broader still. “Lord von Fistenberg treated me to a big shiny pearl necklace!”: it’s like Mrs Brown’s Boys with more face paint. But there’s no resisting the exuberance of Death Drop. Soon, as its cast of pop starlets, tweedy squires and tabloid hacks assemble, and the phone lines are cut, and the roads blocked, this “Dragatha Christie” mystery exerts a grip – of the comedic, if not the suspense, variety.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""5e2beff9a2a80cacb17ab09f99886e2a6e718fd9""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/5e2beff9a2a80cacb17ab09f99886e2a6e718fd9/0_0_3162_4743/667.jpg"" alt=""Vinegar Strokes at the royal-themed gathering."" width=""667"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Vinegar Strokes at the royal-themed gathering.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the cross-dressing has no influence on the unfolding plot, its impact is felt in the cartoonish character of the undertaking.

However, when royals face TV interviewers, it doesn’t always go to plan, as previous examples illustrate.</p> <h2>Prince Charles and Jonathan Dimbleby – 1994</h2> <p>The Prince of Wales’s astonishing admission of adultery on camera stunned the nation and reportedly left Prince Philip incensed when Charles spoke to Dimbleby, his official biographer, two years after he and Diana had separated.</p> <p>His affair with Camilla Parker Bowles had long been the subject of widespread media speculation, but it was quite another thing for the future king to admit he had strayed. In the immediate aftermath, a Sun telephone poll found two-thirds of callers believed him unfit to be king.</p> <p>Addressing tabloid reports, Dimbleby asked Charles if he had tried to be “faithful and honourable” to his wife. To which Charles replied: “Yes, absolutely.” “And you were?” asked Dimbleby. “Yes” Charles replied, before adding: “Until it became irretrievably broken down, us both having tried.”</p> <p>Originally Charles was not convinced he should mention his adultery, but, apparently, was later persuaded that he should as it would come out in a “sympathetic” way. The fallout was immense, not least because it led to Diana’s famous retaliatory interview.</p> <h2>Princess Diana and Martin Bashir – 1995</h2> <p>The Princess of Wales’ revenge interview the following year, with BBC Panorama’s Bashir, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/09/bbc-to-hold-investigation-into-how-martin-bashir-obtained-diana-interview"">was even more controversial</a>. An estimated 22.8 million people watched her discuss her marriage, her eating disorder, and whether her estranged husband could ever to be king. “I don’t think any of us know the answer to that,” she said.</p> <p>She too admitted to an extramarital affair, with guards officer James Hewitt. Bashir asked: “Do you think Mrs Parker Bowles was a factor in the breakdown of your marriage?” Diana paused, before uttering the immortal line: “Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.”</p> <p>To the horror of Buckingham Palace she also spoke of her postnatal depression, and her self-harm. “Yes, I did inflict upon myself, I didn’t like myself,” she confessed, at a time when mental health was a taboo subject.</p> <p>Sir Richard Eyre, ex-director of the National Theatre, later said he had lunch with the Queen shortly afterwards, who reportedly told him: “Frightful thing to do, frightful thing that my daughter-in-law did.”</p> <p>One month later Buckingham Palace announced the Queen had sent letters to the Prince and Princess of Wales, advising them to divorce.</p> <h2>The Duchess of York and Michael Usher – 2018</h2> <p>Sarah, Duchess of York stormed out of a 60 Minutes Australia interview after Usher questioned her about a 2010 sting by the News of the World’s “fake sheikh”, in which she allegedly offered an undercover reporter access to her former husband Prince Andrew <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/may/23/sarah-ferguson-andrew-cash-tabloid"">for £500,000</a>.</p> <p>In the newspaper’s sting, she is heard on camera apparently saying: “I can open any door you want, and I will for you.” However, forced to listen again to the recording by Usher, Fergie rolled her eyes and shook her head before snapping: “Don’t try to trick me now.” She then demanded that “that bit” be deleted before declaring, “What more can I say, what more can I say,” and walking off set.</p> <h2>The Duke of York and Emily Maitlis – 2019</h2> <p>As car crash interviews go, however, Prince Andrew’s with Maitlis of BBC Newsnight over his friendship with the sex-offender US financier Jeffrey Epstein <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/21/importance-of-prince-andrew-interview-became-clear-in-editing-suite-says-maitlis"">is hard to beat</a>.

Many of us are feeling completely overwhelmed by having to educate our children remotely again, nearly 11 months into the pandemic, often while juggling our own work commitments.</p> <p>As a parent, it’s only natural to worry about the impact of such disruption on a child’s educational progress and wellbeing. With children of all ages currently out of school with no definitive return date, it is difficult to know what they “should” be achieving on a day-to-day basis and how you can help them get the most out of this unpredictable time. So we spoke to Emma Marshall – a senior school headteacher, and clinical child psychologist Dr Kate Mason, to find out the real impact of this continuing situation on children and their top five tips on how we can really help them.</p> <h2>Emma Marshall</h2> <p>Emma Marshall is headteacher at Havelock academy in Grimsby. Her main focus during the current lockdown is to ensure that parents and students have easy access to all of the tools needed to continue learning online, in a way that supports their needs as a family. She says that although she is a teacher, she also faces real challenges as a mum in overseeing the remote learning of her 12-year-old daughter and 17-year-old son. She recommends:</p> <p><strong>1 Make it suit your family situation</strong><br>Everyone’s home situation and setup is different and as a headteacher my priority is to make sure that our parents and students feel supported, and know how to easily access the learning resources provided. Along with live lessons, we’re also putting together paper packs of work for those who would really struggle accessing everything online as we understand that not everyone has the technology, or perhaps it’s just not suitable for their learning style or their family situation. The main thing to remember is that we are here for you, so if something just isn’t working for you or your child with regards to the lessons being provided, tell us so that we can help. Don’t feel you’re alone in this because I guarantee nearly every parent and teacher will be feeling the same in some regards.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""47ba71c28891be48b1bcf97306300564c4fbe469""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/47ba71c28891be48b1bcf97306300564c4fbe469/192_30_1246_1246/1000.jpg"" alt=""Havelock academy headteacher Emma Marshall."" width=""1000"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Havelock academy headteacher Emma Marshall.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: John Aron</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>2 Prioritise some sort of routine</strong><br>If nothing else, I would absolutely encourage parents to make sure their kids get up, get showered and dressed and not spend the day in their pyjamas. That way, when they sit down to do some work, it’s mentally like they’re approaching an actual school day. (However, I think putting school uniforms on might be a step too far!) In the first few days of this lockdown I’d return home from work to find our 12-year-old daughter with her laptop, under a duvet and still in her pyjamas. So I said no. Now she knows she must brush her teeth, get washed and dressed and eat something nutritious at a sensible lunchtime – as she would do normally. Because they <em>will </em>have to come back to school at some point. Straying too far from a normal routine and good habits will just make the return to normality even harder.</p> <p><strong>3 Check in with your child<br></strong>Talk to your children – ask them how they’re doing and, most importantly, how they’re feeling. Ask them to tell you five things they’ve learned that day. And remember to reward them. It doesn’t have to be with physical rewards, it can just be a “well done” when you can see that they’ve attempted to do something. Praise goes a long way, especially at the moment. Make sure your child knows that they can get in touch with their school with any problems at all – however big or small it seems to them, their teacher will want to know if they’re struggling in any way whatsoever. Encourage daily exercise away from the screen. They may have some amazing online provision but they don’t want to be in front of their screens all day. Getting out and having a walk is really important. Reading a book, engaging with pets and speaking to their friends is all to be encouraged, as much as the home learning.</p> <p><strong>4 You don’t have to do everything</strong><br>Don’t try to do everything that the school is setting. I promise that nobody is going to tell you that you’re doing a terrible job. I think it’s important that we think back to our school days and remember the pressure we all felt without the pandemic, so don’t make them try to achieve everything they’ve been set in school, from home. If you could do that, you wouldn’t need school in the first place. Don’t get hung up on it not looking like a normal school day – there’s no way it can do at the moment. As parents, we’re not teachers and experts. Even looking at my daughter’s year 8 maths makes my head spin! My role is to make sure she has somewhere safe and warm to work, that she has some vague routine, and then to say “well done” at the end of each day.</p> <p><strong>5 Encourage your children to look to the future</strong><br>I understand why parents, and students, are concerned about the future after all of this, especially those facing exams. My son is due to be off to university hopefully in September. Thankfully he’d worked hard up until this point but now he is a bit like: “Well, I might not even be doing my exams now so is there any point?” We need to keep reminding our children – and ourselves – that the future isn’t cancelled. This <em>will </em>end and things will go back to normal. Encourage them to keep looking forward and thinking about what is happening next. What subjects do they want to take? What are their plans for sixth form? What do they want to do at university? The future isn’t all out of the window, it’s very much just round the corner.</p> <h2>Dr Kate Mason</h2> <p>Dr Kate Mason is a clinical psychologist specialising in children and young people at <a href=""https://www.rootspsychologygroup.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">rootspsychologygroup.co.uk</a>. She understands through her job – and also firsthand as a mother – the impact that the continuing pandemic is having on the wellbeing of our children, and also the stress that it is causing parents. She recommends:</p> <p><strong>1 Your relationship with your child is your number one priority</strong><br>Last March, when we went into the first lockdown, my six-year-old just refused to do the home learning, so this time around I decided not to jeopardise my relationship with my son just to get him to do a bit of maths. I really do believe that in the grand scheme of their lifetime’s education, the younger ones especially will bounce back from this relatively short period of instability. Once I started thinking about it like that, I thought it is not worth the constant fallout. I emailed his teacher and said that I would get him to do what I could, but that a good, happy relationship with him is my first priority.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""fdeefd9a382dfa8d7037dd10f22a7ce92241faa1""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/fdeefd9a382dfa8d7037dd10f22a7ce92241faa1/0_103_1043_1042/1000.jpg"" alt=""Clinical psychologist Dr Kate Mason"" width=""1000"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Clinical psychologist Dr Kate Mason</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>2 Your frustration is coming from a good place</strong><br>During that time when I was losing it over my inability to make my son do his maths and handwriting, I took a step back and asked myself: “Why am I so angry?” And I realised that I was angry because I was scared. I was scared for his education and that it was going to have a massive impact on his life. Understand that is where your upset and frustration is likely to be coming from – ultimately a good place, a place of love for your child.</p> <p><strong>3 Keep calm … and make a visual timetable</strong><br>When children are calm, they are more able to learn. And kids feel calm, safe and contained – and then thrive – when there’s predictability and when they know what is coming next. Make a visual timetable with them peppered with lots of down time and fun stuff and most importantly something to look forward to at the end of the day. It’s vital to keep them looking forward. Treat yourself with calmness and self-compassion too. Remember, you are not their teacher. You can lead a horse to water, you can’t always make it drink. Nearly all children will listen to people who aren’t their immediate family, but they are designed to push your buttons. If this happens stop and take a break. Go and play a game, get their brains to calm down a bit – and only then come back and try again.</p> <p><strong>4 Ask them for their opinion<br></strong>Ask your children for their advice: “What do you think I should do in this situation?” The ability to think flexibly isn’t fully mature until a person is 24, so for any child under that age this is a brilliant chance for that part of their brain to mature and for them to learn real life skills. Educating your kids about emotional literacy is, in my opinion, just as important as developing their ability to do things like maths. Some [children’s films] are full of opportunities for you to ask them questions. Pop one on and engage with them by asking: “Why do you think that person feels that way?”; “How would you feel if that was one of your friends?”; “What could you do to help them?” Opportunities to think and talk emotionally will help develop resilience, confidence, compassion and empathy.</p> <p><strong>5 Congratulate them – and yourself</strong><br>Telling your children “well done” and reaffirming that you’re proud of them on the daily is so important. But you must congratulate yourself, too. You’re doing your best, you’re doing what you can. I think it’s just as important for parents to remember to look after themselves as well. When you’ve got through a hard day and you’ve only managed to get your kid to read two pages of a book, parents need to congratulate themselves. Don’t feel guilty about taking time out to go and have a bath or a walk, and you should also have something to look forward to at the end of the day, like a series on Netflix [or] a glass of wine.

They sought guarantees from the company that they would not face legal action for doing so.</p> <p>Instead, according to correspondence seen by the Guardian, Facebook gave only partial permission. The company said it had “no issue” with the moderators “discussing matters relating to their work” or “other information that is in the public domain” but, it added, they could not share information covered by their “contractual confidentiality obligations”.</p> <p>In a follow-up letter, the workers asked Facebook and Covalen, the third-party contracting firm that is their direct employer, for a copy of those obligations, but received no reply.</p> <p>Phoenix Law, the human rights lawyers representing the moderators, said the workers had not seen a copy of their nondisclosure agreements since they signed them on their first day of work.</p> <p>“Facebook requires content moderators to sign a confidentiality agreement at the end of induction training, without furnishing copies of the materials or agreements,” the moderators alleged.</p> <p>They say that as recently as 18 January, just a few days before the meeting with Varadkar was scheduled, “moderators working for Facebook were warned that any discussion of their work outside of the Facebook office would be treated as a disciplinary offence”. </p> <p>Facebook argues that because the moderators are directly employed by Covalen, it has no direct responsibility for their communications.</p> <p>In a statement, the social network said: “Facebook has legal obligations to protect user data and personal information.</p> <p>“These obligations require Facebook to have confidentiality, privacy and security terms in their supplier contracts, and for their suppliers to convey these obligations to their employees – either through legal documents like NDAs, training, or other means.</p> <p>“The confidentiality agreements that Covalen employees sign are issued and retained by their employer, Covalen. Facebook does not have NDAs with these content moderators.”</p> <p>The workers are being supported by Foxglove, a London-based human rights non-profit that fights to “make tech accountable”.</p> <p>Foxglove’s cofounder, Cori Crider, said: “We were able to say: ‘These people have the right to speak publicly,’ and Facebook knew that they couldn’t come in and try to stop these people talking to the former prime minister.”</p> <p>In a statement, Covalen said: “As part of our recruitment process, every Covalen employee receives a confidentiality agreement via email, along with their employment contract.</p> <p>“Covalen requires each employee to sign the confidentiality agreement and return via email, together with their employment contract, before commencing employment.</p> <p>“As such, there is never an instance where an employee does not receive a copy of their confidentiality agreement. If an employee misplaces their copy of the confidentiality agreement, our human resources team is more than happy to provide them with a copy.</p> <p>“Covalen respects the rights of our employees to meet with public representatives but we always encourage employees, when issues arise relating to their employment, to engage with the company through our internal processes first in order to see if they can be resolved.”</p> <p>In October, as Ireland was entering a high-tier lockdown in which only essential workers were allowed to leave their homes, Facebook moderators working for the contracting firm CPL, a Covalen subsidiary, were told that they were still required to attend the office.</p> <p>The moderators were told that they were classed as “essential communications workers”, and while shielding moderators were allowed to remain at home, those who had vulnerable relatives at home were given no such leeway. In the first two months alone, three cases were linked to the office.</p> <p>As well as Covid safety, the Facebook moderators discussed the “climate of fear” that pervades their workplace with Varadkar.</p> <p>“Through a culture of excessive secrecy and over-broad NDAs, Facebook has chilled moderators’ right to assembly and expression, to access representatives and to blow the whistle about unsafe working conditions,” they said.</p> <p>“Quality scores, extremely granular time tracking (including tracking, for example, bathroom time) and other workplace surveillance create a culture that is undignified and causes moderators needless stress.”",False,pillar/news,News,"['forced marriage', 'forced abortion']"

Anyone who writes for a living on the internet has surely fantasised about payback time for all the keyboard warriors, callous below-the-liners and unrepentant trolls out there. Ivo van Aart’s movie gives full rein to that desire and is snappily directed – but in the end there is something self-satisfied and sententious about his feminist revenge flick.</p> <p>Katja Herbers plays Femke Boot, a newspaper columnist drowning in internet misogyny, especially after she steps out of her usual lifestyle remit to write an op-ed about <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/15/will-dutch-library-ban-on-black-pete-books-spell-end-for-racist-christmas-tradition"">Zwarte Piet</a>, the Dutch blackface folkloric character. Her book publisher is pressurising her for juicier material to better compete with author-of-the-hour Steven Dood (Steven Death), a kohl-rimmed provocateur who savages her on a chatshow. Umbilically fed by her phone on a diet of shitposter abuse, she finally snaps when she realises her neighbour – partial to some Zwarte Piet himself – is one of her tormentors.</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo8IVjVV25k""                                                                        >  <iframe height=""259"" width=""460"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zo8IVjVV25k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As her serial-mom killing spree gets under way, Van Aart drapes a couple of complementary plotlines around it: her daughter Anna (Claire Porro) is fired from the school newspaper and, via the medium of F-bomb-loaded banners, fights a battle for free speech. And when Femke ends up in bed with Dood, it turns out his gothic bad boy persona is just a pose, and he is actually keeper material. These aspects hover soberly around the themes of free expression and online identities – but dilute the black comedy Van Aart attempts to operate with elsewhere.</p> <p>There is some nice absurdist carnage, such as middle-class mum Femke creeping along a gutter to tip a neighbour off the roof in her inaugural murder. But the humour isn’t sharpened to a fine point, leaving each new death to bludgeon in The Columnist’s thesis with the blunt end: online life has robbed us of the ability to appreciate nuance and difference. Femke’s graduation to monster lacks the delicious irony it’s shooting for, as a few plot-logic slips en route – why leave uncleaned weapons around for others to discover? – betray Van Aart’s haste to get his opinion out there. </p> <p>• The Columnist is released on 12 March on digital platforms.",False,pillar/arts,Arts,['woman+murder']

On the night the lockdown was announced, she said, her husband told her what this meant for her.</p> <p>She said: “I was at home with him, we were both listening to Boris Johnson and he looked over at me, he had his arms folded back and chest out, cos he knew that would intimidate me, and he looked at me and he said: ‘let the games begin’.”</p> <p>“And he said: ‘If you think it was bad before with the rape, you’re in for a rough ride.’ So the rape started really, really, really bad, really bad. Curtains would get closed, TV would be up loud, front door would be locked, music would be turned up, so nobody could hear me screaming for someone, for anybody.”</p> <p>Asked if she could recall how many times she was raped during lockdown, Jess said it was “a hundred easily, if not more”.</p> <p>Women’s welfare groups warned that the lockdown would result in an increase in domestic abuse and violence.

An <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/11/imitation-uzi-was-in-car-in-which-man-was-shot-dead-by-police-jury-told"">imitation Uzi was found</a> in the rear footwell, and investigators believe Baker could not have grabbed hold of it to fire at police.</p> <p>The officer, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/17/police-marksman-arrested-shooting-suspect-dead-wood-green"">known as W80</a>, claimed to have acted in self-defence, believing Baker was reaching for a firearm. The officer had been briefed the suspects could be armed and dangerous.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the home secretary, Priti Patel, announced a formal inquiry into the shooting, to examine the circumstances around it and act as the inquest into the death of Baker, from Tottenham, north London.</p> <p>The Crown Prosecution Service has already decided <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/14/met-officer-who-shot-jermaine-baker-wont-face-charges"">the officer should not face criminal charges</a>, following an investigation by the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).</p> <p>In a statement, Baker’s family said: “We welcome the announcement of the public inquiry into Jermaine’s death, and we look now to the inquiry to conduct a full and thorough investigation.</p> <p>“We are, however, seriously concerned that it has taken more than four years to get to this point. It has been and remains a painful process for our family, and it is long past time that the public learned the shocking truth about how Jermaine died.”</p> <p>Baker’s mother, Margaret Smith, said: “We can’t talk about what went wrong that day yet but when the public get to know they will be really shocked.”</p> <p>Although the family welcomed the announcement about the public inquiry, they said they had lost hope in recent years because they had been given five dates first for the inquest and then for the inquiry, which have come and gone.</p> <p>“We first saw the coroner on 22 December 2015, I can’t believe that more than four years later we’re still waiting,” said Smith. “The key thing we want from the inquiry is the truth, the truth, the truth.”</p> <p>The family want the inquiry to focus on the planning of the operation that ended in Baker’s death, the amount of force used against him and why things went so wrong.</p> <p>“Jermaine did not have any weapon. He was unarmed. The only gun that was fired that day belonged to the officer. The other two men who were in the car with Jermaine have been tried, convicted, have served their sentences and are now free to walk the streets again. Jermaine should have been out of prison by now and also walking the streets,” said Smith.</p> <p>“Everything is on hold for us. The officer who shot Jermaine will continue with his life after this but we have to bear the loss of Jermaine for the rest of our lives.”</p> <p>Explaining the delay in announcing an inquiry, Sarah Green, of the IOPC, said: “Our investigation into all of the circumstances surrounding Mr Baker’s death was completed within 12 months and a file of evidence was submitted to the CPS in December 2016.</p> <p>“Its decision to take no further action was made in June 2017. Mr Baker’s family exercised its victim’s right to review and the second decision to take no further action was made by the CPS in March 2018.</p> <p>“In May 2018, we directed the MPS [Metropolitan police service] to hold a gross misconduct hearing and in November 2018 we received correspondence to indicate the officer would be seeking a judicial review of that decision. Matters have since been before the courts.”</p> <p>The IOPC believed W80 should face a gross misconduct charge for his decision to open fire.</p> <p>His lawyers successfully had this decision struck down in court and the IOPC has appealed, with a hearing possibly not taking place until the end of the year.</p> <p>Announcing the inquiry to be chaired by Clement Goldstone QC, Patel said: “Establishing an inquiry is important to ensure that all of the relevant evidence can be properly considered as part of an effective investigation into Mr Baker’s death.</p> <p>“HH Clement Goldstone QC is an experienced retired judge who has the expertise necessary to deliver the inquiry.”</p> <p>The inquiry will need to examine sensitive police intelligence and decision-making by those in charge of the operation.</p> <p>The shooting led to the arrest of the officer in December 2015 by the police watchdog.</p> <p>Baker was part of a group of men who were trying to help Izzet Eren escape from a prison van as he travelled to Wood Green crown court from Wormwood Scrubs prison to be sentenced.</p> <p>The car Baker was in had been bugged by police, and shortly before 9am armed officers surrounded the vehicle and he was shot.

It also wants toy companies to drop separate categories in their advertising and product design, designers to end stereotypical imagery and slogans on clothes, and the representation of female characters improved in books, TV and online content.</p> <p>Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said: “Gender stereotyping is everywhere and causes serious, long-lasting harm – that’s the clear message from the research for the commission. From “boys will be boys” attitudes in nursery or school, to jobs for boys and jobs for girls views among some parents, these stereotypes are deeply embedded and they last a lifetime. We need to end the ‘princessification’ of girls and the toxification of boys.”</p> <p>The report is the culmination of an 18-month process of research and evidence gathering, co-chaired by Prof Becky Francis – now chief executive of the Education Endowment Foundation and Labour MP David Lammy – formerly co-chair of <a href=""https://futuremen.org/appg-on-fatherhood/"">the cross-party parliamentary group on fatherhood.</a></p> <p>The exercise brought together a wide-ranging group of stakeholders, from online parenting group Mumsnet and the National Childbirth Trust, the National Education Union, campaigning group Let Toys Be Toys, Usborne Books and educational publisher Pearson.</p> <p>In the home, a majority of parents recognise that there is a problem, with three-quarters saying people treat boys and girls differently from an early age. They are also seven times more likely to picture their sons working in construction and almost three times as likely to see their daughters in nursing or care work.</p> <p>When playgroup and nursery workers and primary school teachers were asked whether they had seen or heard gender stereotypes perpetuated, more than half said they had “often” or “sometimes” witnessed people say “boys will be boys” when they misbehaved.</p> <p>Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “As a nation, we’re not making fast enough progress on equality between men and women. Issues such as subject choices in education and unequal pay in the workforce all flow from gender stereotypes. The NEU welcomes a conversation about the curriculum practices that could help teachers challenge gender stereotypes.”</p> <p>In retail, an audit of 141 high street shops and 44 online retailers found that children’s clothes, cards and stationery were often sold using explicit segregation, and toys showcased using pink and blue. However, two-thirds of parents said they wanted to see companies advertise items to boys and girls in the same way.</p> <p>In the run-up to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas"">the Christmas </a>peak – and highly profitable – toy-buying season, the report singles out a precedent set in France.

Not so. This episode also took in the relative power of men and women, white woman and black women and the struggle against internalised homophobia. At the risk of opening up a new front in the culture wars, there is even a gender non-binary character. Though I am not sure that is how Yahima, a 200-year old mummified corpse from The Land of Many Waters, would self-define.</p> <p>It all began with Montrose (Michael K Williams) on another boozy bender, burning old photographs and chucking George’s copy of The Order of The Ancient Dawn into the pyre, then standing over the flames, mumbling: “Smells like Tulsa …” An allusion to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/19/tulsa-1921-massacre-trump-violence-legacy"">the 1921 Black Wall Street massacre</a>, presumably, but a clumsy one, no?</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""4cefdba00cc59f1609613e3961d9b0c86d8b90b1""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/4cefdba00cc59f1609613e3961d9b0c86d8b90b1/669_36_4970_2982/1000.jpg"" alt=""Is all as it seems?

His name is a near-homonym for “monstrous” and that was all the encouragement I needed to start fermenting a wild fan theory about him having been possessed by a <a href=""https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Race_of_Yith"">Yithian</a>-like alien spirt during his time in the Braithwhites’ custody. But it could easily be that my attachment to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/13/michael-k-williams-interview-omar-the-wire-the-gambler"">Omar from The Wire</a> is such that I am unable to accept Michael K Williams in a less Robin Hood-esque role.</p> <p>There was no time to work through these complicated feelings, however, as Christina’s silver Bentley came careering through the Chicago streets, heralding two scenes of hectic plot exposition to follow, first on Leti’s doorstep (the exorcist’s daubing of goat’s blood is still working its magic, evidently), then via Tic and Leti’s library row.</p> <p>The fact that much of this was delivered in harried whispers didn’t make it any easier to follow, so allow me to summarise: there are two sets of deciphered pages from the lost Book of Names. One is somehow connected to the orrery (model of the Solar System) that is now in Hippolyta’s possession, but Christina believes it to be in the Winthrop House. The other, Titus’s set, is believed to be in a vault below a Boston museum that only Titus (or one of his bloodline) can access.</p> <p>Seeing as how Christina benefits from some kind of invulnerability spell (the reason Tic was unable to pull the trigger last week) and is also a suspected patricidal genius (she engineered the whole thing to kill her dad!), Leti and Tic figure it would be wise to defend themselves. As Tic concludes: “If I can get my hands on those pages, maybe I can learn the language of Adam and start casting some spells to protect us.”</p> <p>This necessitated another trip to Massachusetts, AKA Lovecraft Country, and no one was much looking forward to spending 15 hours squashed together in confined quarters. Montrose and Tic were still on bad terms, Leti was angry about Tic’s plans to leave town and Hippolyta suspects them all of hiding something about George’s death. Hippolyta’s grievance is the most justified, not only because they really <em>are</em> hiding something, but because she seems like a resourceful woman whose astronomical know-how could come in handy; if they would only let her in.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""b43ce9c8c65080e9d72b5880fcedf523d2f62bfa""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/b43ce9c8c65080e9d72b5880fcedf523d2f62bfa/2750_107_1929_3893/496.jpg"" alt=""Tree (Deron J Powell) in Lovecraft Country"" width=""496"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Tree (Deron J Powell) joins the gang for a trip back to Lovecraft Country.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tree (Deron J Powell) was a much less useful addition to the crew. You may remember him from episode one, when he mischievously directed Tic to walk in on bar owner Sammy in flagrante, or perhaps from the time in episode three where he indelicately muscled in on Tic and Leti’s romance. This week, his habitual mischief-making was starting to look more like malice, as he dropped heavy hints to Tic about Montrose (Tic’s dad) being gay. Any amount of information about one’s parents sexuality is too much information. So it is a shame, really, that Tree didn’t accompany them down into the tunnels, where he might have been crushed by a rolling boulder or the like. The episode could have done with a higher body count.</p> <p>Were there some references here to The Mound – HP Lovecraft’s posthumously published novella about an underground Cthulhu-worshipping civilisation, concealed by a Native American burial site? Any other Lovecraft links I’m missing? Most obviously, of course, this was nothing to do with HP, but rather a chance for Tic to get stuck into the kind of Indiana Jones-esque exploration-adventure that “boys from the South Side don’t notoriously get to do”. Rope ladders, booby-trapped tunnels, floating corpses and mysterious markings etched into stone – Titus’s vault had it all.</p> <p>Meanwhile, back in Chicago, two women – one black, one white – were attempting to further their career ambitions and being thwarted at every turn. Christina found Captain Lancaster – the same police officer who had previously arrested Leti – was unreceptive to discussing Sons of Adam business with a mere daughter, while Ruby just wanted to get a job in retail. She had her dream dashed when she arrived at Marshall Field and Company and happened upon a recently hired black employee (“I know there are a 103 employees at that department store and two of them are never gonna be coloured”).</p> <p>Could these two women’s interests be aligned? That is one possible explanation for the sudden appearance of Christina’s boyfriend-cum-henchman, William (Jordan Patrick Smith), in Sammy’s bar, making eyes at Ruby.

He has a point. But, as I argued in a report for the UCL Constitution Unit published last autumn, the parliamentary convention muddles up two quite separate issues – interference in the prerogative powers of the crown and effects on the private interests of the current sovereign and heir.</p> <p>There is an argument for enabling the sovereign and heir to comment on proposed laws affecting their private interests. They have no vote or voice in parliament – as is necessary to preserve their constitutional position. Queen’s consent is a somewhat heavy-handed way of achieving this, and can give rise to the kind of concerns expressed by Tucker. But while they may have influence, and some may think it undue, it is misleading to describe it as a veto. If consent were refused, parliament would be free to carry on legislating without it, if it chose to. The rule is self-imposed – parliament is free to ignore it.</p> <p>The requirement for consent to interference in prerogative powers is more obviously problematic. These powers are mostly exercised by the government and attach to the crown in name only. Circumscribing prerogatives is what parliament does. It may seem polite to ask for crown consent to do so, but since it cannot be refused, it is an empty courtesy. And doing so risks appearing to draw the sovereign into political controversy. This aspect of consent should be abandoned. The sovereign could ceremonially confirm that those prerogatives were at the disposal of parliament in perpetuity by giving an undertaking which might be repeated at the start of each new parliament, or even each new reign.<br incopy-break-type=""webbreak""><strong>Paul Evans</strong><strong> </strong><br incopy-break-type=""webbreak""><em>Honorary senior research associate, The Constitution Unit, UCL</em></p> <p>• The revelation that the Queen has been using the royal consent rule to ensure her own interests are protected hasn’t shocked me all that much, although the detail is fascinating as it is shocking (<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/feb/07/revealed-queen-lobbied-for-change-in-law-to-hide-her-private-wealth"" title="""">Revealed: Queen lobbied for change in law to hide her private wealth</a>, 7 February).

There are also wider and very serious implications of this abuse, given the close relationship the royals have with powerful people both here in the UK and abroad. Given the excessive secrecy surrounding the royals, how can we know that they aren’t also lobbying on behalf of Middle Eastern kings or American billionaires, all under the guise of protecting their own modesty? Royal consent needs to be abolished, and the palace needs to release all correspondence relating to its lobbying of government going back to the start of the Queen’s reign.

It is a strange land where the president of the United States is a helpless guest, a doomed corner of his own country that is somehow ruled by a former vice president.</p> <p>It is a topsy-turvy place, this Biden’s America. Occasionally, the president can regain his magical ruling powers by summoning assorted minions in uniforms and incanting a spell with his thumbs to tweet the words LAW AND ORDER.</p> <p>But mostly our president is lawless and disorderly, wandering through a country that has been laid low by a virus from China, a candidate from Delaware, and a bunch of friendly questions from Fox News.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>It’s weird that the Republican party finds it so hard to see homegrown terrorists in places like Kenosha</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He is as befuddled as anyone on Facebook about what the hell is going on around him. But rather than trying to fix this dysfunctional version of the land of the free, he prefers to scare the bejesus out of white voters so they might forget this historic pandemic and recession.</p> <p>To steady his <a href=""https://www.mediaite.com/news/watch-trump-nearly-falls-off-platform-while-taking-stage-in-new-hampshire-or-did-he/"">wobbly</a> step, Trump leaned on two men who best represent what he understands by “law and order”. Sitting on one side of our impotent leader was Chad Wolf, the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/us/politics/homeland-security-illegal-gao.html"">illegally</a> appointed acting secretary of homeland security, who likes to send unidentified paramilitaries to assault American citizens but <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/08/06/dhs-secretary-chad-wolf-testifies-federal-agents-portland/5580507002/"">insists</a> that they are not “the Gestapo, storm troopers or thugs”.</p> <p>Sitting on the other side was Bill Barr, the totally impartial attorney general – who <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?next_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.washingtonpost.com%2fnation%2f2020%2f08%2f10%2fbarr-fox-antifa-blm%2f"">called</a> Black Lives Matter protesters “essentially Bolsheviks” – driven by some kind of religious lust for power. Heaven knows that politics and religion are the kind of <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/26/politics/jerry-falwell-jr-michael-cohen-photos/index.html"">bedfellows</a> this president would never lust for.</p> <p>Together, these three outlaws descended on a small outer suburb of Milwaukee and Chicago home to fewer than 100,000 souls, where the Bolsheviks have decided to stage a pivotal uprising against everything good.</p> <p>The facts can be tricky here on the mostly white shores of Lake Michigan, but one thing is clear: Trump cannot feel your pain in Biden’s America.</p> <p>His audience at what this White House called “a community safety roundtable” included a pointless smattering of local suffering – mere pimples on the face of a horrified nation.</p> <p>There were the owners of an office furniture store. “You got hit pretty hard. That’s all right,” said our discomforter-in-chief. “It’s going to get rebuilt.”</p> <p>There was the owner of a candle store. “That’s a very fancy name you have there,” said the man trying to scare white America to its core. “But I’ll bet it was beautiful. Is it – are you going to rebuild? Will you be rebuilding?”</p> <p>“We were not destroyed, very fortunately,” said the candle lady.</p> <p>“Well, we’ll be giving you some help,” Trump said anyway.</p> <p>You never know, the Bolsheviks might come tomorrow.</p> <p>Then there was the camera store guy, who has been in business for 109 years, according to Trump.</p> <p>“You’re insured, right,” he asked. Yes, said the camera guy. “And so they’re helping, and they’re being responsible?” Why yes, said the store owner.</p> <p>So much suffering caused by the strange revolutionary forces of Biden’s America, gathering on the shores of a great lake for no great reason.</p> <p>“To stop the political violence, we must also confront the radical ideology that includes this violence,” said our explainer-in-chief. “Reckless, far-left politicians continue to push the destructive message that our nation and our law enforcement are oppressive or racist. They’ll throw out any word that comes to them.”</p> <p>It’s almost as if these politicians throw out words like bullets fired into the back of a father climbing into his car where his three children were waiting for him.</p> <p>You see, in Trump’s version of Biden’s America, violence springs like Athena from the head of Joe Biden, or AOC, or Lenin. It has no relationship to <a href=""https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/25/us/who-is-jacob-blake-trnd/index.html"">Jacob Blake</a>, who was not named by Trump or his sidekicks at their community safety roundtable.

Somehow the town’s non-racist law enforcement turned a blind eye to Rittenhouse, walking the streets with his AR-15-style assault rifle, and his friends even after the shootings.</p> <p>Some types of radical ideology are good, and some are bad. The original Bolsheviks understood that distinction pretty well.</p> <p>There are many strange things that happen in Biden’s America. As Trump told Laura Ingraham of Fox News on Monday, there were <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/01/politics/laura-ingraham-donald-trump-fox-news/index.html"">people</a> wearing black clothes on “a plane from a certain city this weekend” who were headed to the Republican convention that just ended. “A lot of people were on the plane to do big damage,” said the man tasked with protecting the constitution, as well as a nation of confused citizens.</p> <p>As if that isn’t bad enough, there are police who shoot unarmed civilians because they can’t take the pressure. It’s a bit like playing golf, Trump told the audibly horrified – but otherwise entirely supportive – Fox News interviewer.</p> <p>“You know, a choker, they choke,” Trump explained, somehow managing to dehumanize both the shooting victim and the police officer who pulled the trigger. “Shooting the guy in the back many times. Couldn’t you have done something different? … But they choke. Just like in a golf tournament, they miss a three-foot.”</p> <p>It’s weird enough that a Republican party that campaigned for so long on the war on terrorism finds it so hard to see homegrown terrorists in places like Kenosha. It’s weirder still that the party now blindly follows a man who likens shooting someone in the back to missing a putt.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/01/donald-trump-laura-ingraham-fox-news-interview"">Five bizarre moments from Trump\'s interview with Fox\'s Laura Ingraham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the weirdest thing in Biden’s America is that Donald Trump can only echo Joe Biden.

Hepher started at fly-half opposite Ronan O’Gara in the 9-8 final win over Munster and Lam always had a hunch his old friend and teammate would develop into a successful coach.</p> <p>“I knew then he had a good rugby brain and we worked really well together,” said Lam. “I was the captain, he was fighting with Paul Grayson for the No 10 jersey and that 8-9-10 spine of the team spent a lot of time strategising and running the game together. It was a big part of that success.”</p> <p>A scheduled 20-year squad reunion had to be abandoned last year because of Covid but the pair have always remained in touch. “When I was coaching the Blues and he was on his way up, he came down to Auckland to see what we were doing in the southern hemisphere,” Lam said. “I always look forward to seeing him at games and it is no surprise at all that he is doing really well.”</p> <p>The next challenge for Hepher will be to find fresh ways to neutralise the dangerous and reliably pacy Bears back division. Lam’s decision to hand the No 10 shirt to Max Malins feels like another statement of intent, ensuring the in-form England player and the returning Charles Piutau are both on the field from the start.</p> <p>There is also a tantalising duel at outside centre where Piers O’Conor, enjoying such a fine season, will be up against Henry Slade, another player hoping to convince Gatland that the Lions cannot depart without him. Both sides, though, know the forward tussle will be pivotal: the return of Bristol’s talismanic captain, Steven Luatua, is significant in that regard with Scotland’s Sam Skinner filling the sizeable blindside gap left by Ewers.</p>  <figure class=""element element-embed"" data-alt=""The Breakdown"">  <iframe id=""the-breakdown"" name=""the-breakdown"" src=""https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-breakdown"" scrolling=""no"" seamless="""" class=""iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe"" height=""52px"" frameborder=""0"" data-component=""email-embed--the-breakdown""></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>One more eye-catching performance from Sam Simmonds may also be enough to secure the No 8 Lions berth but, with Bristol 12 points ahead of their rivals with six regular-season rounds to go, the Chiefs’ director of rugby, Rob Baxter, is more concerned about his side finishing the domestic campaign strongly.</p> <p>“I’ll be honest, we’re not playing at our best yet,” Baxter said. “However, I can definitely see us on an upward curve, which is important at this time of year.

Others posted online old photos of Israeli police and army officers kneeling on the necks of arrested Palestinian men – similar images to that of the death of George Floyd, whose killing while under police restraint has spurred <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd"">protests across the US</a>.</p> <p>The Ramallah-based&nbsp;Palestine Institute for&nbsp;Public Diplomacy <a href=""https://twitter.com/ThePIPD/status/1267121540753129472"">shared</a> a drawing on Twitter of Halak and Floyd side by side, with “two countries, similar systems” written above them. “[Iyad] and George were victims of similar systems of supremacy and oppression. They must be dismantled,” the advocacy group said.</p> <p>Halak had been on his way to an educational institute in Jerusalem’s Old City, where he studied. Shortly after the shooting, police raided his family home.</p> <p>Two officers were questioned under caution on Saturday, with one placed under house arrest while investigators looked into the incident, local media reported.</p> <p>Amir Ohana, the public security minister who oversees Israel’s police, vowed to investigate but said officers were “required to make fateful decisions in seconds in an area that has been inundated with terror attacks, and in which there is a constant danger to their lives”.</p> <p>During the past few years, lone Palestinian attackers have stabbed or shot civilians and police in Jerusalem, although the incidents have dropped in frequency since an escalation in late 2015 and 2016.</p> <p>Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, did not mention the killing at a cabinet meeting on Sunday, but his defence minister and alternate prime minister, Benny Gantz, apologised for the incident. “I am sure this subject will be investigated swiftly, and conclusions will be reached,” Gantz said.</p> <p>B’Tselem, a leading Israeli human rights group, said justice was unlikely. While its researchers have only partial data for official police complaints, they found that investigations into the killings of more than 200 Palestinians by the army during the past nine years resulted in only three soldiers being convicted.</p> <p>“Even in a case as clearcut and horrifying as this, the opening of the investigation is simply the first step in its whitewash,” the group’s spokesman, Amit&nbsp;Gilutz, said of Halak’s killing.</p> <p>“Enforcing an occupation and denying millions of people their human rights requires a great deal of perpetual state violence. Therefore, existing Israeli law enforcement mechanisms are designed to protect the perpetrators of this violence – not their victims.”</p> <p>Gideon Levy, an Israeli columnist and one of the most prominent anti-occupation voices in the country, <a href=""https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-being-black-in-america-shouldn-t-be-a-death-sentence-what-about-being-palestinian-1.8883372"">expressed</a> little hope for an impartial investigation or that the killing – which he argued was not unusual – might lead to change in Israel and Palestine.</p> <p>“The [Israeli] border police are no less brutal or racist than the police in the United States,” he wrote in Haaretz newspaper. “There, they shoot black people, whose blood is cheap, and in Israel they shoot Palestinians, whose blood is even cheaper. But here, the killing puts us to sleep; there it sparks protest.”",False,pillar/news,News,['honor killing']

It is vital that the actions of public bodies do not have the effect of dissuading able and experienced individuals from becoming or remaining charity trustees.”</p> <p>There had been no dishonesty, bad faith or personal gain on the part of Batmanghelidjh or the trustees, Mrs Justice Falk said. Nor had there been any inappropriate expenditure on children assisted by the charity.</p> <p>Batmanghelidjh told the Guardian: “I’m so relieved, for the children, for the staff, the trustees, for the volunteers. They have been shamed by the many false stories about Kids Company over the years. I’m so glad I stood up against it and didn’t back down. This judgment brings tears to my eyes. I’m so glad that finally the facts won.”</p> <p>The official receiver had asked the court to disqualify Batmanghelidjh as a company director for six years for her alleged part in the collapse of the charity. Although she was not formally a member of the board, the receiver argued her importance as the charity’s founder and chief executive made her a “de facto” trustee.</p> <p>It also sought four-year director bans for five Kids Company trustees at the time of its closure in August 2015: its former chair, the TV executive Alan Yentob, Richard Handover, Jane Tyler, Andrew Webster and Francesca Robinson. A three-year ban was sought for Vincent O’Brien, and a two-and-a-half-year ban for Erica Bolton.</p> <p>The court judgment will clear the way for a separate Charity Commission inquiry to be published into the administration, governance and financial management of Kids Company. The commission’s statutory inquiry has been ongoing since August 2015 but was put on hold when the official receiver took action.</p> <p>The official receiver had argued, backed with thousands of pages of evidence, that Kids Company was poorly governed and managed, that it operated inadequate financial controls and failed to put away sufficient financial reserves. The charity had knowingly operated an unsustainable model, it argued.</p> <p>However, Mrs Justice Falk ruled that while aspects of it were high risk, the Kids Company operating model was not unsustainable in principle. She said the board and Batmanghelidjh had formulated a restructuring plan along with the government to refinance the charity.</p> <p>“In summary, the court’s decision is the allegation is not made out against any of the directors and they are not unfit; in other words, the case against them fails,” said Mrs Justice Falk.</p> <p>Set up by Batmanghelidjh in south London in 1996, Kids Company became one of the best-known charities of the early 21st century. It counted on high-profile political backing from the likes of Gordon Brown and David Cameron, and support from artists such as Coldplay and JK Rowling.</p> <p>Iranian-born Batmanghelidjh, a psychotherapist by training, pioneered an intensive therapeutic model of working with maltreated and traumatised youngsters, often taking on the care of children who had been rejected by mainstream services after experiencing sexual abuse, violence, addiction and mental illness.</p> <p>Batmanghelidjh became a celebrity, yet despite raising hundreds of millions of pounds from the public and philanthropists and winning more than £42m in government grants over a 15-year period, Kids Company often struggled to keep its finances on track as its costs and ambitions rose.</p> <p>A month before it collapsed, Batmanghelidjh announced she was to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/03/camila-batmanghelidjh-to-leave-kids-company"">step down</a> as part of a £3m Whitehall plan to refinance the charity. That restructuring never took place, and in August 2015 the trustees wound up Kids Company after the Metropolitan police announced an inquiry into allegations of sexual abuse at the charity, revealed by BBC Newsnight.</p> <p>The police inquiry subsequently found <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/28/police-drop-kids-company-abuse-investigation"">no evidence of criminality</a> or failures of safeguarding. Batmanghelidjh and Yentob have claimed the “malicious and untrue allegations” of child abuse against the charity were deliberately orchestrated to fatally damage it and were directly responsible for its closure.</p> <p>Two parliamentary reports have been published on Kids Company. The first, by the public accounts committee in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/13/kids-companys-special-treatment-other-children-lost-out"">November 2015</a>, found tens of millions of government grants were spent by the charity without proper Whitehall assessment of whether it achieved value for money.</p> <p>A February <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/01/kids-company-collapse-mps-pacac-report-blame-negligent-trustees"">2016 report</a> by the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee blamed a combination of “negligent” trustees and the “unaccountable and dominant” Batmanghelidjh for the charity’s failure.",False,pillar/news,News,['sexual abuse']

So its revival, in the light of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/08/prince-harry-and-meghan-say-they-are-stepping-back-from-royal-family"">stepping back as senior working royals</a>, has a certain contemporary resonance.</p> <p>The abdication of 1936 hangs over the play (we hear Edward’s radio broadcast and “crowds around the palace”), though the crowning of his brother, George VI, is not mentioned. Tension between brothers is central to the story here: Evelyn and Rupert Farrant are at war with each other.</p> <p>Tom York, best known as one of the Carne brothers in Poldark, plays both Evelyn, a camp, down-at-heel thespian, and Rupert, the richer, more respectable of the pair. One lives in dingy Soho and is forced to flirt with the landlady to stave off paying the rent; the other has inherited the family fortune and lives a gentleman’s life.</p> <p>We meet Evelyn in the opening scene, persuading an ex-army major to murder Rupert. What follows is a kind of revolving-door farce with twins, dead bodies and a gun. York plays the brothers with gusto and there are some nifty manoeuvres that suggest both brothers are present on stage, even if we can see and hear the effort of the production team behind various curtains.</p> <p>But this cannot take away from the tepid humour as Corpse! seems to retreat into a nostalgic world of bygone Englishness. Evelyn goes to Fortnum &amp; Mason for lunch; Rupert wears a smoking jacket and dines at his club. The production, directed by Clive Brill, seems like a melange of influences thrown together, from Hitchcock to Ealing comedy to Carry On.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""5863eee52bfcacba4d5517c79cbb4aa688d062f9""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/5863eee52bfcacba4d5517c79cbb4aa688d062f9/0_411_4357_2615/1000.jpg"" alt=""Felicity Duncan as Mrs McGee and Tom York as Farrant in Corpse! by Gerald Moon at Park theatre, London."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">What a carry on … Felicity Duncan as landlady Mrs McGee and Tom York as Evelyn Farrant in Corpse!</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stereotypes abound, from the none-too-bright Irish conman posing as an army man (Paul Kemp) to the lonely, lascivious landlady (Felicity Duncan).

Deforestation, antibiotic resistance and overfishing could be overcome and reversed in some cases, Brown insists.</p> <p>Although attitudes are changing to plant-based diets and growing numbers of Americans are eating less meat, Brown still has a mountain to climb to make his vision a reality. A January 2020 <a href=""https://today.yougov.com/topics/food/articles-reports/2020/01/21/veggie-meat-burger-poll"">YouGov survey</a> found more than two-thirds of US adults identify as meat eaters, while beef burgers were rated more highly than plant-based equivalents for taste.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""14cfa635700ece2b19201dfe0f3292ae56e6d802""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/14cfa635700ece2b19201dfe0f3292ae56e6d802/0_227_4000_2400/1000.jpg"" alt=""The flagship Impossible Burger bleeds when it’s cooked."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The flagship Impossible Burger bleeds when it’s cooked.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there’s good reason to see the need for change. Millions of hectares of ecosystems are <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00656-5"">projected to disappear</a> by the middle of the century to meet future demand for agriculture, animal feed and bioenergy.

More than half of mammals are livestock, mainly cattle and pigs, and just 4% are wild animals.</p> <p>“The entire cause of the catastrophic collapse of wildlife populations, which are less than a third of what they were 50 years ago, globally, is the use of animals as a food technology,” Brown claims, ahead of his talk at <a href=""https://websummit.com/"">Web Summit</a>, a technology conference hosted virtually from Lisbon, during which he told the tech industry it was “game over” for traditional animal agriculture.</p> <p>“Cows outweigh every remaining wild vertebrate on land by more than a factor of 10.

Let’s get rid of friggin’ cows and let nature recover,” he says.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Processed food is a pejorative term because people are used to applying it to foods that are basically sugar and salt and garbage</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Brown’s vocabulary is infused with the lexicon of Silicon Valley. Livestock are a “prehistoric food production technology”. Meat production from animal cadavers is “not part of the value proposition” for consumers. He speaks with his body, fidgeting with the impatience of someone who is certain they are right.</p> <p>Did Brown ever eat meat? Yes, until his early 20s, but he stopped when he realised he was only doing it for pleasure. Does he really mean all meat and fish could be substituted? What about chorizo? “No problemo.” And what happens to livestock farmers? “They’re not going to be in that business any more. But there’s a lot of very reasonable solutions.”</p> <p>But the rise of Impossible Foods, which claims to have “cracked meat’s molecular code” and aims to to decouple “meat” from animals, has not been without controversy. Unlike the market leader Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods uses genetically modified ingredients to replicate the texture, taste and sensations of eating meat. Soy leghemoglobin – known as heme – produced by genetically modified yeast, is the key to replicating the “meaty” taste. The Impossible Burger even “bleeds” as it is cooked.</p> <p>Some <a href=""https://medium.com/impossible-foods/how-gmos-can-save-civilization-and-probably-already-have-6e6366cb893"">scientists say such GMO innovations</a> can save humanity, but the UK Food Standards Agency has not licensed the ingredient for sale in the UK and requires a pre-market safety assessment. Impossible Foods says it plans to meet and exceed food-safety regulations in all parts of the world, including the UK. In the US, the company has faced criticism from a number of organisations, including Friends of the Earth and the <a href=""https://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/actions/6060/before-you-grill-the-impossible-burger-this-4th-of-july-read-this"">US Center for Food Safety</a>, over concerns that the process to produce heme has not been properly tested and that the products are “overprocessed”.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""14496c62d5abb1e181a42830ad49c3cded93f0e1""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/14496c62d5abb1e181a42830ad49c3cded93f0e1/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg"" alt=""Impossible Foods plant-based beef products displayed in the meat section of a Hong Kongsupermarket."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Impossible Foods’ plant-based beef products displayed in the meat section of a Hong Kong<br>supermarket.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Lam Yik/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Joe Rogan, the comedian and podcast host, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHgCnYiEWMc&amp;t=136s"">savaged the Impossible Burger</a> on his show, citing unproven claims about ingredients in the products. The US Food and Drug Administration has twice investigated soy leghemoglobin and found no questions about its safety.</p> <p>“It’s ridiculous,” says Brown. “Our foods are no more processed than the foods that people eat every day.

Daunte Wright deserves that, his family deserves that. Full accountability under the law. That’s what we’re going to continue to work for.”</p> <p>Elliott also announced that Gannon had stood down. The city commission had voted on Monday night to recommend his termination. Gannon’s deputy, Tony Gruenig, was presented as the city’s new acting police chief at the briefing.</p> <p>Elliott also called on the Democratic Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, to assign the case to the state attorney’s office for investigation. It is currently being handled by Minnesota’s bureau of criminal apprehension (BCA), which Gannon said on Monday was not aligned with his decision to immediately publicly release police body-cam images of Wright’s killing.</p> <p>The sudden senior personnel changes in Brooklyn Center, a suburb 10 miles north of downtown Minneapolis with a population of about 40,000 reflect the growing outrage over police involvement in the killing of Wright, whose family say he was stopped because of an air freshener hanging in his car’s windshield.</p> <p>At the Tuesday press conference, Elliott appeared to acknowledge community concerns that the suburb’s officers were seen as “outsiders”.</p> <p>“As of this moment I don’t believe even one of our officers lives in Brooklyn Center,” Elliott said, adding that he thought the department had about 49 sworn officers.</p> <p>“I do feel very strongly that you need officers to be from the community. There is a huge importance to having a significant number of our officers living in the community where they serve.” </p> <p>Gruenig was also questioned by activists at the press conference who demanded to know details of the police department’s plans to improve community engagement. One unidentified man said: ““When I watched the video it was triggering. What can you do going forward to make sure this racial profiling does not continue?”</p> <p>The man added that the small city felt like a “sundown town”, a way of describing a historical term for a white supremacist community where it is made known that people of color are in danger after dark.</p> <p>“I was only appointed police chief an hour ago. I don’t have a plan,” Gruenig replied, before promising to embark on the process.</p> <p>Elliott said the new police leadership was committed to working with community leaders and protesters.</p> <p>“We’re hoping that we’re turning over a new leaf now,” he said. “I’m confident of that now.",False,pillar/news,News,"['honor killing', 'women killed over honor']"

When you can sit for your own purpose, you’re crafting your tomorrow.”</p> <p>Afrofuturism is many things: <a href=""https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/afrofuturism"">an art movement</a>, the term being coined by culture critic <a href=""https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/what-is-afrofuturism"">Mark Dery in 1993</a>, a philosophy on science that incorporates African culture with technology and an inspiration for creators including music group Sun Ra and author Octavia E Butler.</p> <p>“When you see a protest march like Black Lives Matter, it’s people being empowered to change their future,” said Carter. “It ties into systemic racism and abolishes that mindset. Afrofuturism is about trying to make a difference for tomorrow, trying to make a change.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""8c064a7a696f9d17e81a9176c0efbf90a3bf0beb""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/8c064a7a696f9d17e81a9176c0efbf90a3bf0beb/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg"" alt=""undefined"" width=""1000"" height=""667"" class=""gu-image"" /> </figure>  <p>The exhibition features costumes from Selma, Malcolm X and Do the Right Thing, shown alongside sketches, research material and ephemera.</p> <p>For her Black Panther designs, Carter was influenced by indigenous tribes across the continent, while incorporating African design influences, like neck rings worn by South African Ndebele and textiles from Ghana (she used a sheen, triangle motif on the superhero suit as a nod to the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/movies/black-panther-afrofuturism-costumes-ruth-carter.html"">sacred geometry of African patterns</a>).</p> <p>“The opportunity to infuse the different cultures around Africa was a huge honor,” said Carter. “I felt there were still people who have this backwards mindset that Africa is just one monolithic place, people living in huts with flies on their faces.”</p> <p>Among the Black Panther costumes on view, there is one worn by Dora Milaje, the tribe of women who served as special forces to Wakanda. The designs included beadwork inspired by the Turkana tribe in Kenya, the Himba tribe in Namibia and South Africa’s Ndebele tribe.</p> <p>“To go into the tribes and use some of the techniques that they used was a language that we were able to adopt and present in a Marvel film,” she said. “We combined the two in such a way that not only honored Africa but the African diaspora. It gave people something to be proud of to call their own.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""5c7bfa9f884aac2fb18c8f4a2ba8181699fdf5cc""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/5c7bfa9f884aac2fb18c8f4a2ba8181699fdf5cc/0_0_5962_4000/1000.jpg"" alt=""Danai Gurira, Lupita Nyong’o and Florence Kasumba in Black Panther."" width=""1000"" height=""671"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Danai Gurira, Lupita Nyong’o and Florence Kasumba in Black Panther.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Marvel/Disney/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Something she’s loved has been seeing how kids would dress up as Black Panther characters for Halloween. “It empowered children to dress up like their favorite characters because it gave them ownership,” she said. “It’s very powerful what that film could do for people.”</p> <p>There are also costumes from Ava DuVernay’s 2014 film Selma, as Carter turned Oprah Winfrey into the voting rights activist Annie Lee Cooper. “Being on the set of Selma, I feel like I was witnessing Ava DuVernay embody her own Afrofuturism,” she said. “She is a visionary creator. That is the mindset.”</p> <p>It’s a testament to the much-overlooked job that costumes designers do, day in, day out, as visual storytellers in their own right – they can bring an audience into a decade, an era, seamlessly, with expert nuance. “There’s a leader, it’s the director,” said Carter. “They’re constantly mulling over how to best project the story. Sometimes they’re big adjustments, other times they’re small adjustments. You have to be in tune with those adjustments.”</p> <p>She really cut her teeth on the set of Spike Lee’s 1989 film Do the Right Thing. “When we made that film, we were seeing a future of black people in storytelling,” she said. “It was a forward-thinking idea when we made that film.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""81a5e664eeff9a9f8aed9699e6046aa3b6f576fe""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/81a5e664eeff9a9f8aed9699e6046aa3b6f576fe/0_0_2944_2030/1000.jpg"" alt=""A still from Do the Right Thing."" width=""1000"" height=""690"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A still from Do the Right Thing.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The exhibit features a number of outfits from the film, including a handmade T-shirt that says “Bed Stuy or Die” (Carter says it was painted by a local Brooklyn artist).</p> <p>“Spike Lee had a clear vision for the film, to support the community,” said Carter. “Brooklyn has always been a hub for small businesses and the African diaspora. We wanted to show that Brooklyn has a strong sense of culture. We brought in a lot of African fabrics and colors that are very saturated, it looks like a mosaic.”</p> <p>The film was certainly a brighter version than what Brooklyn was like back in the late 80s. “If you look into the real Brooklyn, it was a duller palette, a greyer tone,” she said. “We were creating a painting; a bit of surrealism went into it.”</p> <p>The exhibit also features a selection of retro 1970s costumes worn by Eddie Murphy for his role in the 2019 film Dolemite Is My Name. The actor calls Carter “<a href=""https://www.indiewire.com/influencers/dolemite-is-my-name-costume-designer-ruth-e-carter/"">the best out there</a>” in terms of costume design.</p> <p>Carter is working with Murphy again for the comedy sequel Coming 2 America, out in March. “This is African royalty,” said Carter of her work for the film. “We want to honor Africa, we want to honor the first movie and still want it to be modern and fresh.”</p> <p>The new film will show more of Zamunda, the African kingdom where Prince Akeem, Murphy’s character, comes from. “We didn’t see much of Zamunda, if at all, in the first movie,” said Carter. “We just saw the deity with the royal bat on their throne. Now we get to see more of Zamunda. We were excited about telling that story.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""3a290b3f56b1a448232a1e451e60341633a53940""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/3a290b3f56b1a448232a1e451e60341633a53940/194_0_3512_2108/1000.jpg"" alt=""Garcelle Beauvais in Coming 2 America."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Garcelle Beauvais in Coming 2 America.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Courtesy of Amazon Studios</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All the crowns and jewels were 3D-printed, she says. “They were made on the computer, except one,” explains Carter. “One crown from the original movie shows up here, James Earl Jones wore his original crown.

You have been barred from any physical contact with your wider family. If you have been in a care home, government failures have left you catastrophically exposed. And yet at the same time, there are plenty of voices in government circles arguing that you should pay the bill for the virus.</p> <p>A month ago a broadly centrist thinktank, the Social Market Foundation (SMF), said a key element of the so-called “triple lock” on the state pension <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/scrap-triple-lock-uk-pensions-coronavirus-crisis"">should be scrapped</a>, to save £20bn.</p> <p>If you are unfamiliar with the triple lock, it’s one of the cornerstones of UK state pensions. It ensures the state pension increases each year by the highest of earnings, price inflation or 2.5%. The SMF argued that the 2.5% guarantee should be removed.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/scrap-triple-lock-uk-pensions-coronavirus-crisis"">Coronavirus UK: call to scrap \'triple lock\' on pensions after crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=""https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/05/12/revealed-treasurys-menu-measures-counter-337bn-budget-deficit/"">Leaked Treasury documents last wee</a>k suggested that an end to the triple lock is indeed on the table as the government grapples with the expected <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/uk-budget-deficit-to-rise-to-300bn-this-year-obr-says"">£300bn cost</a> of the pandemic.</p> <p>The promise was intended to lift pensioners out of poverty, and it has gone some way to achieving that aim. Analysis conducted in 2017 by the Institute of Fiscal Studies showed that between April 2010 and April 2016, <a href=""https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8942"">the value of the state pension increased by 22.2%</a>, compared with growth in earnings of 7.6% and growth in prices of 12.3% over the same period.</p> <p>The SMF argued that “in the post-crisis world of slow, painful recovery, a triple lock ensuring a 2.5% minimum rise in pensions would constitute enormous generosity to pensioners, at a time when working-age adults face low or no wage growth and significant unemployment”</p> <p>It’s a seductive argument. The young are indeed taking the economic brunt of coronavirus, with youth unemployment already soaring. Graduates this year will be entering the worst labour market for decades. Why should they be the victims of austerity round two?</p> <p>Yet it ignores a basic fact about our very basic state pension in the UK. Yes, the triple lock means the value of the state pension has moved up in value. But it still remains one of the worst in Europe, and axing the guaranteed 2.5% increases will hit the poorest pensioners hard.</p> <p>Comparing state pensions around Europe is phenomenally difficult, but by any measure the UK’s is pretty lousy. In 2019 <a href=""https://fullfact.org/online/pensions-countries-comparisons/"">FullFact.org</a> tried to check figures circulating on Facebook, which suggested (at the time) that state pensions in France, Spain and Germany were double those in the UK.</p> <p>It could not determine exact figures, but did find evidence that an average UK pensioner’s income from “mandatory” savings is worth 29% of their earnings at retirement, compared with 51% in Germany, 75% in France and 82% in Spain. In the UK, private pension savings will increase that figure substantially, but fail to meet the levels of France or Spain.</p> <p>The European country with a state pension most similar to the UK, Ireland, pays up to €248.30 – that’s £221.31 at current rates – compared with the maximum of £175.20 in the UK. So Irish pensioners get 26% more than British pensioners, yet we are considering trimming ours back.</p> <p>There is much debate around “intergenerational fairness” which falls into the trap of “us versus them”. In truth, there are many, many rich pensioners – and many, many poor ones. A friend of mine revealed how he was staggered to discover that his recently-deceased elderly father’s pension (from a final salary scheme) was more than £60,000 a year. Yet he got the winter fuel allowance, free TV licence, free prescriptions and so on. But that’s small beer in comparison with the huge tax giveaway he got – the pensioners’ exemption from national insurance.</p> <p>Currently workers pay <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-rates-letters"">12% NI on earnings above £9,516 a year</a>, dropping to 2% on earnings over £50,024 a year. But your liability ends once you reach state pension age. My friend’s father saved saved more than £5,000 a year from being exempt from NI.</p> <p>It’s a big loophole (though of course the number of pensioners receiving £60,000 a year or more is relatively small). Yes, NI is supposedly an insurance fund that pays for state pensions, but in reality that is notional only and the money goes into the general tax pool, paying towards the NHS as well.</p> <p>Maybe there should be a targeted lifting of the NI exemption – such as requiring that pensioners pay a half-rate of NI on incomes above a certain level, perhaps something like £25,000 a year. It would still raise significant sums and ensure that only the better off contribute, while enabling us to maintain the triple lock and gradually lift more pensioners out of poverty.",False,pillar/lifestyle,Lifestyle,"['forced marriage', 'forced abortion']"

Black police recruits are still considered by many to be self-loathing traitors. It’s a harsh reality captured by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/25/uks-first-black-police-chief-michael-fuller-memoir-hay-festival"">Michael Fuller, the UK’s first black chief constable</a>, in his memoir published last year, which took its title from the cry he heard from angry black protesters during the 1981 <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1981/apr/13/fromthearchive"">Brixton riots</a>, directed at his police officers: “Kill the black one first.”</p> <p>Nearly four decades after the riots, Kevin Maxwell acknowledges those conflicts felt by black officers, but he writes that nothing would have deterred him from realising his boyhood dream. When he joined the force in 2001, Maxwell writes, his “policeman’s badge wasn’t just a shield, but a family crest”.</p> <p>His book is full of dismaying revelations. The sergeant who brutally kicks and stamps on an already cuffed black suspect is later made a diversity champion. Bored with all the “political correctness crap”, coppers completing mandatory racial equality questionnaires photocopy each other’s answers. Maxwell doesn’t spare himself. He asks a black motorist who complains about regularly being stopped: “If you don’t like living in the UK, why don’t you go and live somewhere else?” At the station’s Christmas party he attempts to laugh off the comedian’s joke that he had been spotted performing oral sex on a prisoner. The “joke” barely disguises his colleagues’ suspicion of Maxwell, because not only is he black, he is gay.</p> <p>The youngest of 11 siblings, brought up by a single mother on a Liverpool council estate, Maxwell transcended expectations. He was bright and keen, and quickly recognised by the police hierarchy as an ideal candidate to counter the 1999 <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/macpherson-report-what-was-it-and-what-impact-did-it-have"">Macpherson report</a>, which found “institutional racism” within the force. But Maxwell was not so naive as to believe he’d entered a post-racial institution. To progress at work, he drew the lesson articulated by Fuller that: “Police racism was an ugly beast in the corner which I didn’t want to poke.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""b0cc070d80341d07b7d9a60afabb5caeed0bdff8""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/b0cc070d80341d07b7d9a60afabb5caeed0bdff8/0_3_3000_1800/1000.jpg"" alt=""The Brixton riots in 1981."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The Brixton riots in 1981.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Six years into his career, Maxwell’s growing unease peaked when, transferred to Special Branch and sent to Heathrow, he was tasked with interviewing terrorist suspects. His colleagues assumed that Maxwell should be the first to stop black or Asian people “as a ‘buffer’” before handing them on because “blacks don’t complain about blacks”. In <em>Forced Out</em> Maxwell argues that racial profiling at Heathrow was self-defeating. By targeting marginalised people whose “interactions with the state teach them that they are intrinsically suspicious and not worthy of society”, the police would not catch terrorists so much as help to create them.</p> <p>After almost a decade in uniform, it dawned on Maxwell that he’d been in an abusive relationship. He had suppressed his grievances about being sidelined, and subjected to racial discrimination and homophobia. In the book’s second half, this realisation triggers a blizzard of correspondence, first to his police superiors, and subsequently to his local MP, the mayor of London and the home secretary. It signals an abrupt tonal shift in the memoir which thereafter reads like an extended crime report of the force’s assault on Maxwell’s integrity and mental health. The inevitable progress towards an employment tribunal exerts further emotional strain, even breaking up Maxwell’s marriage.</p> <p>He is dogged in pursuit of justice: “I didn’t want to be another of those officers, settling out of court,” he recalls. Like many institutions challenged by an employee, the police management default to attack mode. “I just wanted acknowledgement of wrongdoing,” Maxwell writes, “yet they were going after me as though I had the code to a nuclear device.”</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>I just wanted acknowledgement of wrongdoing, yet they were going after me as though I had the code to a nuclear device</p> <footer> <cite>Kevin Maxwell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Relying on medical reports, emails from HR and bosses, logs and appraisals, <em>Forced Out</em> becomes a kind of true-life drama that can be a little overwhelming. Down the rabbit hole we go, of meetings, consultations, conference calls and broken confidences. Rather than distil the information, Maxwell invites readers to chart every turn in the force’s increasingly machiavellian approach (including leaking his details to the Sun). He succeeds at the tribunal in 2013, but is traumatised.</p> <p>Maxwell wants us to know all the details of his personal case, including the counter campaign pursued by the police managers (who even tried to dismiss him <em>after </em>he’d already resigned). But he also wants to convey that we all have skin in the game.He describes himself as a “cultural Catholic” and his tone throughout <em>Forced Out</em> is that of a supplicant on his knees in a confessional booth, hoping for absolution. He has nothing to be forgiven for. The end of Maxwell’s career is not only his and the police force’s loss, but all of ours.</p> <p><em>• Forced Out: A Detective’s Story of Prejudice and Resilience is published by Granta</em><em> (RRP £14.99).</em",False,pillar/arts,Arts,"['forced marriage', 'forced abortion']"

Quite simply, research suggests that women with more oestrogen in their bodies are less likely to die and more likely to have milder symptoms of Covid-19. Doctors are also discovering that topping up low hormone levels seems to help some women suffering from long Covid. Yet, this area of research is being sorely neglected. I wonder why?</p> <p>We know that two thirds of coronavirus deaths occur in men. But the female Covid mortality rate starts to rapidly increase as women hit their fifties – after menopause, when their protective hormones, oestrogen and progesterone, <a href=""https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20214494v1"">drain away</a>.</p> <p>It turns out, however, that women who take either the combined contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy – both of which include oestrogen – have a lower risk of ending up in hospital and of dying. Generally, oestrogen enhances the immune system, while testosterone has an immunosuppressive effect.</p> <p>As Caroline Criado Perez’s book <em><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/28/invisible-women-by-caroline-criado-perez-review"">Invisible Women – Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men</a></em>, says, gender blindness in medicine and areas like tech just produces a “one-size-fits-men” culture. There is a gender data gap here that is not just irritating, but life threatening.</p> <p>I’ve become fascinated by oestrogen’s superpowers during research over the past year for a book and an forthcoming Channel 4 documentary about the menopause. Aside from being a female sex hormone, oestrogen does sterling work throughout the body and brain. It regulates immunity and inflammation, and that terrifying “<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/coronavirus-what-do-scientists-know-about-covid-19-so-far"">cytokine storm</a>”, which rips coronavirus patients apart in hospitals, is less severe in women than men.</p> <p>Hormone replacement therapy comes in many forms now. The latest body-identical hormones are a big improvement on the early synthetic ones that brought screaming headlines on the risks of breast cancer. When the newer transdermal oestrogen HRT – a £4-a-month gel or patch – is used, it’s been proven to protect women from heart attacks, osteoporosis, diabetes, colon cancer and memory loss, as well as <a href=""https://www.menopausedoctor.co.uk/menopause/menopause-and-hrt-the-truth-behind-the-taboo-video-with-sign-language"">stopping hot flushes</a>. Why not Covid-19 too?</p> <p>The good news is that it might. A recent study of more than 5,451 deaths in women from 465 GP practices in the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners database showed that women who were using any form of HRT were <a href=""https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/02/19/2021.02.16.21251853.full.pdf"">78% less likely to die of Covid</a>. Of course, there’s a slight healthy user bias for women who opt to take HRT, but that’s still a mighty protective effect.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>A number of patients of menopausal age have been treated privately with HRT and their Covid symptoms have disappeared</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In September, the <a href=""https://covid.joinzoe.com/us-post/covid-estrogen-hrt"">Zoe Covid Symptom Study </a>app showed that women on the contraceptive pill were less likely to catch the virus. Later, a TriNetX global database survey from 17 countries, showed women taking oestrogen HRT <a href=""https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-01851-z"">were 50% less likely to die </a>of the virus.</p> <p>The science on oestrogen is not all there yet – we need more extensive studies as we follow the trail from hospital to patients at home with long Covid. An online survey of 1,294 women suffering the miserable symptoms of <a href=""https://www.newsonhealth.co.uk/media/files/Female-hormones-and-Covid.pdf"">long Covid found a majority </a>reported that their periods had changed and said their symptoms were worse before or during their periods when oestrogen levels are at their lowest.</p> <p>The Covid app found that long Covid is particularly prevalent in women between the ages of 50 and 60 and, aside from respiratory problems, the rest of the reported symptoms in women have a huge crossover with those of menopause – fatigue, insomnia, brain fog, joint pain and heart palpitations.</p> <p>Dr Louise Newson, a menopause specialist, said: “These symptoms are likely to be related to low oestrogen and also testosterone levels in women, so consideration should be given as a priority to replacing these low hormone levels with the right dose and type of HRT.”</p> <p>So far, Newson and others have treated a number of patients of menopausal age privately with HRT, and their Covid symptoms have improved or disappeared. But there’s no suggestion of hormonal help on the <a href=""https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/long-term-effects-of-coronavirus-long-covid/"">long Covid section</a> of the NHS website.</p> <p>NHS experts have seen these latest academic papers on hormones, HRT and long Covid, but so far there’s been no announcement of further research – or hands-on treatment with oestrogen, a cheap drug we already know to be safe. The NHS website has pages of information on long Covid, but the suggested solution to chronic fatigue is “get a good night’s sleep”.</p> <p>Science bends and sways with the news cycle: rules and vaccine doses change not always because of medical proof, but according to government expediency. Research is fast-forwarded in these times of trouble, so why has oestrogen been left behind?

Von der Leyen had to make do with a second-rank seat on a sofa opposite Turkey’s foreign minister.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, Von der Leyen’s spokesperson made clear the commission president’s feelings over the issue, noting that the incident had “sharpened her focus” on the issue of equal rights during the discussions that followed.</p> \n<p>He said: “The president of the commission was clearly surprised and that is something you can see from the video … The protocol level of our president is exactly the same as that of the president of the European council.</p> \n<p>“Our president is a member of the European council in her own right and normally when she goes to foreign countries she was treated in exactly the same way as the president of the European council.</p> \n<p>“The president expects that the institution that she represents to be treated with the required protocol and she has therefore asked her team to take all appropriate contacts in order to ensure that such an incident does not occur in the future”.</p> \n<p>The spokesperson suggested that the commission president took a calculated decision to carry on the meeting despite the affront.</p> \n<p>“The president’s assertiveness was clearly on display in that she did not walk away from the meeting, she took part in the meeting, and played her full role,” the spokesperson added.</p> \n<p>Iratxe García Pérez, the Spanish MEP who leads the Socialist and Democrats group in the European parliament, <a href=""https://twitter.com/IratxeGarper/status/1379547277447008260?s=20"">tweeted</a>: “First they withdraw from the Istanbul convention and now they leave the president of European commission without a seat in an official visit.

The main result of the meeting was that the EU agreed to extend the five-year, €6bn (£5.2bn) under which Brussels had provided funding in return for stopping the movement of migrants to Greece.</p> \n<p>In a statement late on Wednesday, Michel said he was “sorry” that he had appeared indifferent in the video to Von der Leyen’s “distressing situation”.</p> \n<p>He said: “I am therefore sorry for two reasons. First, by the impression given that I would have been indifferent to the protocol awkwardness vis-à-vis Ursula.</p> \n<p>“All the more so since I am honored to participate in this European project, of which two major institutions out of four are headed by women, Ursula von der Leyen and Christine Lagarde. And also proud that a woman, the first in history, succeeded me as Prime Minister of Belgium.</p> \n<p>“Finally, I am saddened, because this situation has overshadowed the major and beneficial geopolitical work that we carried out together in Ankara, and of which I hope that Europe will reap the fruits.</p> \n<p>In his statement, however, Michel said the incident had occurred as a result of the Turkish government applying a strict interpretation of ‘protocol’, in a comment that appeared to clear both himself and Ankara of any blame.",False,pillar/news,News,['gender-based violence']

Emerging from a pod that looks like a truffle, the mushroom unfurls half a dozen arms, all a throbbing scarlet, like a collection of tongues. Each of these is forked and, across their stems, a series of black sticky lumps pop up like rotting barbecue. It’s supposed to smell something awful too.</p> <p>The uncanny blooming of the <em>Aseroe </em><em>rubra</em><em> </em>is one of many transfixing moments in Fantastic Fungi, a crowdfunded US documentary made by Louie Schwartzberg, an affable old hippie and pioneer of time-lapse photography (though the stinkhorn in question was filmed by Stephen Axford). It stars Paul Stamets, a trailblazer in the popularisation of mycology, the study of fungi, and bursts with footage revealing the secret life of mushrooms. It also seeks to usher the viewer into a seductive world where fungi are the answer to some of mankind’s biggest questions.</p> <p>Schwartzberg has shot time-lapse footage for blockbusters (The Bourne Ultimatum) avant garde movies (Koyaanisqatsi), and for Pope Francis (projected on to the Vatican walls in support of the Paris climate agreement). Time-lapse has been his specialism for four decades.He began soon after graduation, unable to afford regular 35mm. “It was $100 per minute for film and processing. If you shoot time-lapse, you only shoot one frame every 10 minutes, and that means you’re not burning much film. I shoot about two seconds of screen time every 24 hours. From 40 years, I’ve got 20 hours.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""9710e4ca2e55dcc0ea6713b38a7637c1973cebd3""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/9710e4ca2e55dcc0ea6713b38a7637c1973cebd3/81_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg"" alt=""Fantastic Fungi"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">‘I love the idea of my camera as a time machine’ … Fantastic Fungi</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Plants are moving, but we can’t see it. But that doesn’t mean they’re not alive. I love the idea of using my camera as a time machine to be able to look at the world from the point of view of other living things. That’s how you become more open-minded.” Contemplation of the world of fungi, he believes, can in turn offer insights into how human society might learn from the natural world.</p> <p>The key to this understanding is the role of mycelia. The stuff that forms the fuzz on your iffy apple, mycelia are networks of fungal filaments. With the ability to extend to kilometres in length, they play a complex and powerful role in natural ecosystems. Among other things, they are ardent recyclers, working through dead natural material (and unnatural, species of fungi have been shown capable of breaking down plastics and crude oil) to create nutrients that are ploughed back into the soil or the roots of plants.</p> <p>“I’m just in love with what they represent,” Schwartzberg says. “This economy under the ground where nutrients are shared without greed for ecosystems to flourish. This idea of a network that shares … is sort of the model that we need to live our lives on. To change our social structure to. It’s just a beautiful metaphor, without being preachy.”</p> <p>The film sometimes nudges into evangelism, however. Brie Larson’s voiceover frequently assumes the role of fungi’s spiritual spokesperson, uttering lines such as: “When you sense the oneness you are with us.” Fantastic Fungi’s mission is to persuade the viewer of the beauty of organisms that leave many queasy, to live in harmony with the natural world – and to regularly ingest psychedelic drugs.</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ez8BffoK4I""                                                                        >  <iframe height=""259"" width=""460"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-ez8BffoK4I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Schwartzberg is an advocate of the consumption of magic (psilocybin) mushrooms. Stamets says a substantial dose in his youth cured his lifelong stutter, as well as opening his mind to the glories of the natural world – mostly after teaching himself mycology. He now has 40 patents, and his company, Fungi Perfect, which generates $30m in revenue a year, helps to fund further research.</p> <p>Stamets believes in the potential for psilocybin to be used effectively as a medicine, in helping treat both depression and dementia. This is the focus of the work at a new “centre for psychedelic research” at Johns Hopkins University.</p> <p>“What gives me hope is that this is a revolution from the ground that is sweeping the planet,” Stamets says. “Louie’s movie is extremely timely ... so is the realisation that psilocybin mushrooms make you happier and make you smarter. Who doesn’t want to be happier and smarter? Actually, some people don’t.”</p> <p>As affable as Schwartzberg is via Zoom, Stamets is stern. He is worn out by his interactions with the media, frustrated even more by humanity’s inability to appreciate our inextricable place in the natural world, and our need to help preserve it. He decries “the hubris of human beings thinking they’re so smart, [that they can] make a calculation on the value of the ecosystems that got us here today”.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""ff38532b4beec931f10288ef01d3674c413de78d""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/ff38532b4beec931f10288ef01d3674c413de78d/70_0_1920_1152/1000.jpg"" alt=""Mycellia in action in Fantastic Fungi"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Mushroom socialism … mycelia in action in Fantastic Fungi</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stamets also believes in the curiosity and acuity of young people to help force change in a more sustainable direction. The next generation of mycologists are given their moment in the final act of Fantastic Fungi, and it’s inspiring. But Stamets’ outlook is gloomy. Our disregard for the natural world, he says, has left us exposed to the ravages of viruses (something mycelia often help to stave off in nature). This has led us to Covid-19, but the current pandemic might only be the beginning.</p> <p>“We have now entered into a whole new stage in the evolution of our society,” Stamets says. “We have now gone from viral storms, which are rare and few, to viral hurricanes. We will have viral hurricanes coming to us seasonally as a new norm. There’s not going to be one at a time, it’s going to be overlapping and repetitive. This is really all hands on deck.</p> <p>“The only solution for us to survive this is by protecting natural ecosystems and living in harmony with nature. Not extracting and exploiting it to the ultimate harm of the commons. If we reinvest in the commons, we have a lot of microbial allies in nature that will leap up to disperse.

Atrocities have also been attributed to Tigrayan forces.

The Eritreans called in reinforcements, then began searching for young men and boys, and executing them.</p> \n<p>“The [Tigrayan] youth are very angry. Until recently, [the TPLF] couldn’t train or arm all of the volunteers that were coming to them … In recent days, they are telling them to come forward again,” said one TPLF administrative official who fled Tigray for a neighbouring province and is in touch with former colleagues there.</p> \n<p>William Davison, an Ethiopia analyst with the International Crisis Group, said there were multiple accounts of young men joining the the military wing of the TPLF as news of atrocities spread. “There seems to be almost unanimous outrage … It’s very difficult to say how big the rebel force is now but all indicators suggests that manpower is not a problem,” he said.</p> \n<p>The anger among Tigrayans has been reinforced by attacks on sites that have huge cultural importance in the province. The targeting of once-sacrosanct refuges has also pushed those fleeing violence to seek out TPLF-controlled zones, messages passed by local residents to relatives outside Tigray suggest.</p> \n<p>Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said on Thursday that her office had corroborated grave violations that could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity in Tigray.</p> \n<p>Most of the massacres reported so far occurred in November or December last year, but there is evidence that they continued into January. Between 150 and 300 young men are reported to have been killed in a village near Dela, south of Samre, during fighting about six weeks ago.</p> \n<p>Though details of the incident are unclear, relatives of victims have contacted friends and sympathisers in Europe, telling them that after clashes with TPLF fighters, government soldiers rounded up men of fighting age and shot many in the fields. After Samre was retaken in mid-February,<a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-conflict-fires/hundreds-of-buildings-burned-around-tigray-town-research-group-says-idUSKBN2AP196""> fires appear to have been deliberately set to destroy</a> more than 500 structures close to the town.</p> \n<p><a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7vgex/they-started-burning-the-homes-ethiopians-say-their-towns-are-being-razed-in-ethnic-cleansing-campaign"">Other images</a> suggest similar burning of homes elsewhere in Tigray, such as along the border with Eritrea.</p> \n<p>There is also widespread concern about attacks on women and children, and ongoing sexual violence. Patients at Ayder referral hospital in Mekelle have included about 120 sexual violence survivors, some bringing reports of gang-rape by soldiers. “It is a plague on women. Our sisters are suffering,” said one medic working with survivors of rape who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals.</p> \n<p>Eritrean officials have described allegations of massacres by their soldiers as <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/eritrea-ethiopia-massacres-kenya-684eecac7798dcfcb2157823334ef4ad"">“outrageous lies”.</a> The Ethiopian government said on Wednesday that federal officials were investigating “credible allegations of atrocities and serious human rights abuse” and would ensure accountability.</p> \n<p>“Ethiopia rejects any partisan interventions and politically motivated campaigns against the country and government, aimed at undermining the rule of law measures it has taken, and will continue to take in bringing the criminal clique and other perpetrators to justice,” the statement said.</p> \n<p>Davison described the conflict as “probably unwinnable for either side”. “If people are going to put the pieces back together they need to find a way of starting a political process,” he said.",False,pillar/news,News,"['rape', 'gang-rape', 'domestic violence']"

They said they were staying in secret locations and were afraid to go outside.</p> <p>One of the men, Rupert Smith, said he was aware of a total of seven deportees who were in hiding and fearful of being the victims of violence if they were to live openly. The Guardian confirmed the names of the men he identified as having been on the flight.</p> <p>All of those returned believe their lives are in danger in Jamaica. Some have previously received threats from gangsters or have family members who have been threatened.</p> <p>“At least seven out of the 17 on the flight are in hiding,” Smith said. “I had to leave my family and my kids behind. The Home Office say we are violent and dangerous. I got into a fight with someone who was behaving in an inappropriate way towards my daughter and have one conviction for actual bodily harm.</p> <p>“Some of those on the flight committed a single crime many years ago and have been living in the community ever since. My lawyer in the UK is still working on my case and I hope I’ll be able to return to the UK.”</p> <p>The Home Office is rumoured to be planning a second charter flight to Jamaica next week for approximately 50 Jamaicans who were taken off this week’s deportation flight after an eleventh hour court of appeal ruling in their favour. The ruling said they should not fly as they had not had five working days of access to their lawyers because of problems with the phone signal at two detention centres close to Heathrow airport – Colnbrook and Harmondsworth.</p> <p>There are also several detainees at Brook House near Gatwick airport who won a reprieve from flying on this week’s charter flight following individual legal actions by their lawyers. They fear they might be deported on a future flight.</p> <p>One of the men who was on the deportation flight, who asked not to be named, said: “I’m stressed to the bone by all this. I don’t want anyone to know my location and I haven’t even been able to break the news to my kids yet that I’ve been deported. My lawyer in the UK told me he was hopeful of stopping my flight so when they came for me in the detention centre I didn’t even have time to collect my things together. I arrived here with no spare clothes.”</p> <p>A third man, Junior Kerr, who has a conviction for grievous bodily harm, said that he was also in hiding.</p> <p>“They took me to Doncaster airport in a prison van in a cage. I believe my life is in great danger here so I have to remain inside the house where I’m staying. I can’t leave at all. I can’t bear being away from my kids.”</p> <p>Kerr’s partner, Ruschell Robinson, said that the couple’s children were devastated about being separated from their father.</p> <p>“Junior has been out of jail for two years and he has been a model citizen since then,” said Robinson.</p> <p>“He’s a mentor to our kids and to others. Our seven-year-old son is crying all the time and our nine-year-old daughter is refusing to eat and is hardly saying a word.”</p> <p>Sonia Phillips, partner of Elvis Dunkley, who was on the charter flight, said she and her children were struggling without Dunkley, who was convicted in 2003 of a drugs offence.</p> <p>“I’m disabled with arthritis and back problems and Elvis did everything to look after me and the children,” she said. “My 18-year-old son is now having to take our younger children Jacob and Savanna, who are five and six, to school every day as I’m unable to do this. I can’t break the news to them that he’s been deported so I’ve told them he’s gone on holiday.</p> <p>Toufique Hossain of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who issued judicial review proceedings to try to halt Tuesday’s charter flight, said that the legal action was continuing.</p> <p>He said: “We continue to pursue our legal challenge on several grounds including our clients’ clear submission that they ought to remain in the UK and their deportation orders ought to be reconsidered pending the government’s review on foreign national offenders.”<br><br",False,pillar/news,News,['gang-rape']

Messages she got from local authorities said women aged 19 to 59 were expected to have intrauterine devices (IUDs) fitted or undergo sterilisation.</p> \n<p>In 2017, Sidik was 47 and her only daughter was at university when local officials insisted she must have an IUD inserted to prevent the unlikely prospect of another pregnancy.

Do not gamble with your life, don’t even try. These things are not just about you.

But later in 2018 a routine check found it was missing and she was forced to have a second device installed, and then a year later forced to undergo sterilisation.</p> \n<p>“In 2017, just because I was an official worker in a school, they gave me a wider choice to have this IUD or sterilisation operation. But in 2019 they said there is an order from the government that every woman from 18 years to 59 years old has to be sterilised. So they said you have to do this now.” </p> \n<p>She tried to plead both age and the damaging impact of the IUDs on her health. “I saidmy body cannot take it, but they told me ‘you don’t want children, so you have no excuse not to have the sterilisation operation.’”</p> \n<p>Her story, first told to the <a href=""https://www.duhrf.org/project/qelbinur-sidik-a-twisted-life/"">Dutch Uyghur Human Rights Foundation</a>, is difficult to verify. It is hard to take photos inside detention facilities and there is little documentation. But details match accounts by other camp detainees and research into coercive birth control practices.</p> \n<p>She previously gave anonymous accounts of her experience in the camps and with IUDs, but had not spoken about her sterilisation.</p> \n<p>She was frightened that being identified might affect family still in China, particularly her husband. But he has since divorced her, and with that link severed Sidik decided to come forward under her name.</p> \n<p>“What happened in the concentration camps and in the whole region was really, really terrible. I couldn’t stay silent,” she said. “I wonder why western countries still cannot believe what’s happening inside those camps. I wonder why they keep silent.”</p> \n<p>During the years when Sidik was targeted for forced sterilisation, she was also sexually harassed at home by a Han Chinese man sent to live as a “relative” in her apartment, under a programme of surveillance rolled out across Xinjiang.</p> \n<p>Initially he spent a week every three months in their home, but later this increased to a week every month. There have been <a href=""https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/cosleeping-10312019160528.html"">reports</a> of Han “relatives” in Uighur homes forcing female hosts to share beds, and sexually assaulting them, particularly when men were in camps.</p> \n<p>Sidik was also a witness to another aspect of repression. As one of the few camp instructors to have gone public, she had a clearer overview of the system of mass incarceration than survivors who were caught up in it.</p> \n<p>She worked as a teacher in two camps, where she claims she saw starvation rations and unsanitary and humiliating conditions, including limited access to bathrooms and water. She also heard the screams of tortured prisoners and witnessed at least one inmate being carried out dead.</p> \n<p>In the second centre where she worked, which held mostly young women, a trusted colleague told her that rape of inmates by Han Chinese administrators was routine.</p> \n<p>“Every time I saw them it just reminded me of my daughter, and I thought: please, not my daughter,” she said, weeping at the memory. Most of the prisoners were in their 20s and 30s, she said.</p> \n<p>Sidik came from a family that would once have been considered a model of assimilation by local authorities, speaking fluent Chinese, working at a government school and following government exhortations to have only one child.</p> \n<p>She initially dismissed reports of forced sterilisations and mass detentions from other parts of Xinjiang as something that happened to troubled communities. “We felt compassion, but it was some faraway story, not something that will happen to us.”</p> \n<p>But the long shadow of ethnic oppression may have saved her life. She was born into the turbulence of the Cultural Revolution, and her mother listed her as an Uzbek, even though she has always considered herself a Uighur and that was the official ethnic identity of others in her family.</p> \n<p>Permission to leave China is given only rarely to Muslim minorities from Xinjiang these days, and almost never to Uighurs. She left China in late 2019 and expects to never return. Her husband, a Uighur, applied for a permit to travel with her. Authorities told him: “Don’t even dream about it.”",False,pillar/news,News,"['forced marriage', 'forced abortion']"

GWS will now fly out on Thursday – for Sunday’s clash with Gold Coast – with the Swans expected to also depart NSW two days earlier than first planned.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/28/sonny-bill-williams-is-a-surefire-drawcard-yet-his-nrl-return-still-perplexes"">Sonny Bill Williams is a surefire drawcard yet his NRL return still perplexes | Nick Tedeschi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Sydney clubs were originally scheduled to share a flight into Queensland on Saturday. That arrangement may no longer be practical given both clubs’ travelling parties will swell because they are taking more players than would be the norm for a single game.</p> <p>Swans coach John Longmire conceded on Tuesday it was possible that his team would not play again in Sydney this year.</p> <p>“Anything is possible in this environment,” he said. “You have to roll with the punches a bit. If that’s the case, that’s the case ... if the plan changes we’ll move with it. What you’re fast becoming accustomed to is turning up to work on a Monday and being not sure what the next day will bring.”</p> <p>The impact has also been felt in Super Netball, with the opening round of fixtures changed to accomodate a last-minute dash for the border by teams meant to play in Sydney this weekend.</p> <p>The two Sydney teams, the Swifts and Giants, will now face each other at Brisbane’s Nissan Arena on Saturday, with their original opponents, the Adelaide Thunderbirds and West Coast Fever, to square off in the second part of a double header.</p> <p>Super Netball said it will now review player health and welfare, load and travel requirements before announcing any changes to round two, after which all teams were to congregate in a Queensland hub anyway, for at least the remainder of the first six rounds.</p> <p>“The league has understood from the beginning that this season would need to be flexible to ensure we’re able to carry out a full 60-match competition and we have created a system and fixture to deal with the uncertainty of this health emergency,” said Super Netball CEO Chris Symington.<br><br>“The health and safety of all players, officials and support staff is paramount and by moving all scheduled matches to Queensland this weekend and beyond, we’re ensuring this safety, along with the sustainability of the season.”</p> <p>The NRL, which has previously been given exemptions from border closures but must reapply each time Queensland updates its measures, is seeking reassurance from the Queensland government that will continue to be the case.</p> <p>The NRL is awaiting official word from Queensland Health but, at this stage, insists its current exemption to travel during Covid-19 means there will be no issue. The league has had the freedom to move games between NSW and Queensland since the restart, with teams being chartered across state lines and returning without staying overnight.</p> <p>The new restrictions will certainly not affect this weekend’s matches given Cronulla play in Brisbane on Friday night, while Canberra and Newcastle’s players are not from the Sydney region. Canterbury’s trip to the Sunshine Coast next weekend in round 13 would be the first travel under threat for the NRL.</p> <p>And there is uncertainty over the impact of the new restrictions on the Super Rugby Au competition, with the Queensland Reds to play the NSW Waratahs in Sydney on 8 August before heading back to Brisbane to play the Rebels the week after.</p> <p>The other professional league currently up and running, the A-League, appears to have escaped the latest travel chaos with clubs already locked into a NSW hub, where the remainder of the season will be played out.",False,pillar/sport,Sport,"['forced marriage', 'forced abortion']"

It wasn’t just that 2019’s triple-Grammy winning <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/29/billie-eilish-when-we-all-fall-asleep-where-do-we-go-review"">When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</a> was incredibly popular, although it was. Eilish was already a phenomenon among tweenage girls, but its commercial success – it went platinum or multi-platinum in 17 countries – catapulted her into a different sphere of fame, where everyone from Tyler, the Creator to Pete Townshend expressed their approval, Rolling Stone magazine ranked it among the greatest albums of all time and the producers of the James Bond franchise commissioned Eilish to sing the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/14/billie-eilish-no-time-to-die-review-bond-theme"">theme to No Time To Die</a>.</p> <p>What invites quite so much anticipation, though, is that its success clearly impacted on the music industry: you don’t have to look too far in 2021 to find Eilish acolytes, hastily signed in an attempt to mimic her success. The question of what the 19-year-old and her brother and co-collaborator Finneas do next – on an album that was apparently hastened by the Covid pandemic and the cancellation of Eilish’s world tour – is an intriguing one.</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzeWc3zh01g""                                                                        >  <iframe height=""259"" width=""460"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fzeWc3zh01g?wmode=opaque"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzeWc3zh01g"">Watch the video for Your Power</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Its presumably ironic title, Happier Than Ever – its recently released cover art features Eilish in tears – suggests the darkly sarcastic mood of When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? will predominate again. But <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzeWc3zh01g"">Your Power</a> is a noticeably different song from anything on its predecessor. The themes of When We All Fall Asleep offered teenage angst skilfully whipped up into gothic melodrama: jealousy and heartbreak, self-loathing, worrying about drugs. Your Power’s subject matter deals with the considerably darker topic of sexual abuse, coercion and control: an older man, who the lyrics suggest is either a musician or actor – “Will you only feel bad if it turns out they kill your contract?” – preying on a young woman, a situation that’s “ruined her in a year”. To complicate matters further, the song’s protagonist seems to have been subject to his attentions as well: “I thought that I was special, you made me feel like it was my fault.”</p> <p>The music dials down the electronic horror-movie soundtrack approach of Eilish’s previous album in favour of something more understated. On the surface, there’s nothing to it but an acoustic guitar and Eilish’s reverb-drenched voice: the obvious comparison would be <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/jul/19/mazzy-star-beginners-guide"">Mazzy Star</a>, already a significant influence on latterday pop thanks to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/lana-del-rey"">Lana Del Rey</a>’s regular repurposing of their sound. Underneath, subtle production touches deepen the track.</p> <p>Its power lies in Eilish’s vocal, which remains gentle and drowsy throughout, no matter how strident the lyrics become in their condemnation: “You were the devil… / how dare you and how could you?” There’s something weirdly matter-of-fact about the song’s refrain: “Try not to abuse your power,” she sings, as if reminding someone to take their house keys with them. Maybe the matter-of-factness is the point – the song’s subject shouldn’t have to be told this – but the disjunction between the lyrics and the way they are sung gives the song a chilling air, at odds with the prettiness of its tune and the gentle dreaminess of its sound.</p> <p>It works in a way that the umpteen hectoring message songs that have cropped up in pop over the last few years don’t, getting under your skin rather than in your face.",False,pillar/arts,Arts,['sexual abuse']

These events can go ahead if acting within the regulations. It is quite right that authorities are challenged as to why football fans can march through Glasgow but women can’t protest about violence and harassment.” </p> \n<p>A spokesperson for Greater Manchester police urged people not to gather in person, but said the force was “shocked and saddened” by Everard’s death and expressed support for online vigils.</p> \n<p>“We understand there are a number of online events as well as a doorstep vigil that have been arranged for this evening and GMP absolutely supports these and encourages our communities to join them.”</p> \n<p>In Belfast, Reclaim The Night is hosting an online vigil at 6pm to “remember Sarah and all victims of gender-based violence” and are asking those who cannot attend to light a candle at the same time.",False,pillar/news,News,['gender-based violence']

Ethiopian migrant workers are often told to try to return to their employers.</p> <p>At the heart of this human rights crisis is a system of migrant labour that remains a stain on many countries in the Arab world. <a href=""https://www.ilo.org/dyn/migpractice/docs/132/PB2.pdf"">Known as </a><em><a href=""https://www.ilo.org/dyn/migpractice/docs/132/PB2.pdf"">kafala</a></em>, or “sponsorship”, it effectively hands the fate of workers to their employers, who often withhold their passports to maintain control, and then demand that fees paid to employment agencies be repaid if workers want to leave before their contracts are up. This forces some workers to run away and become undocumented.</p> <p>Anna, a nanny from the Philippines, told me how she managed to slip away from her abusive employer by layering three sets of underwear, tops and trousers on top of each other. That way she managed to bring with her a change of clothes without carrying a bag. She had lost so much weight by then, she jokes, that she could wear that much stuff without raising suspicion. She left everything else, including her passport, behind.</p> <p>The cruelty of this <em>kafala</em> system isn’t an unfortunate outcome of bureaucracy, it is the result of a racist hierachy in which black workers find themselves at the bottom. Of all the nationalities that jostle and hustle for a living in the Middle East and the wider Arab world, dark-skinned African women are the cheapest to hire, the most desperate, and the most abused.</p> <p>All <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/16/pandemic-raises-fears-over-welfare-of-domestic-workers-in-lebanon"">migrant workers in Lebanon</a> are struggling, Christine told me, but African women suffer the most because “we are not considered human beings, everybody ignores us. We are invisible.” Employers who can no longer pay their workers’ salaries can still house and feed them, but they choose not to, even though many maids and nannies offer to work for free.</p> <p>As with any crisis, the most vulnerable are pushed off the cliff edge. Lebanon is struggling with a corrupt and incompetent political class, and now the aftermath of an explosion that would challenge the most robust infrastructure. The size of the rebuilding process that Beirut faces means that hungry African women sleeping rough on Beirut’s streets are rendered invisible twice – first by Lebanese society, which treats them as subhuman, and again by a global community that cannot see so many layers down into Lebanon’s ranking of victims.</p> <p>For now, Beirut’s migrant workers are sticking together and sharing whatever meagre resources they have. They also try to warn others to stay away from the country. Christine fears they will still come in any case, because they believe they may be the lucky ones. “When you are poor you think, ‘Let me try,’ she says. “We just want to try.”</p> <p>• Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist and the author of <a href=""https://guardianbookshop.com/we-need-new-stories-9781474610407.html"">We Need New Stories: Challenging the Toxic Myths Behind Our Age of Discontent</a",False,pillar/opinion,Opinion,['domestic violence']
tv-and-radio/2021/apr/19/mare-of-easttown-review-kate-winslet-hbo-murder-mystery,article,tv-and-radio,Television & radio,2021-04-19T21:10:21Z,Mare of Easttown review – Kate Winslet triumphs in a moreish murder mystery,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/apr/19/mare-of-easttown-review-kate-winslet-hbo-murder-mystery,https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2021/apr/19/mare-of-easttown-review-kate-winslet-hbo-murder-mystery,"Mare of Easttown (Sky Atlantic) is a millefeuille of misery, as exquisitely layered and as moreish as the real thing. In rural Pennsylvania, we meet a small-town cop, Mare Sheehan (Kate Winslet). World-weariness, the weight of professional responsibility and – we discover later, although the clues are there – family tragedy show in every line of her body, every heavy step she takes. She rarely smiles. She is not surly or grumpy – she just doesn’t have the energy for anything else, after doing her job and taking care of her family.</p> <p>Life takes out of Mare more than it puts in – especially since 19-year-old Katy Bailey, the drug-addicted daughter of Mare’s high-school friend Dawn, disappeared a year ago. If you can have a defining performance this late in a career, this is surely Winslet’s. She is absolutely wonderful – and ably supported by the rest of the cast.</p> <p>This is a defiantly unglossy US. Easttown is a bleak, impoverished place, full of overlapping sadnesses. As the tiny, tight community’s police detective, Mare sees and deals with most of them. Drug and alcohol addiction is rife. One of the earliest scenes shows Mare attending the scene of a burglary – another burglary, we understand – at the house of a woman called Beth Hanlon (Chinasa Ogbuagu, in a small but heartbreaking role; she is due to return in later episodes). It is her brother, Freddie (Dominique Johnson), on the hunt again for things to sell for his next fix.</p> <p>When Mare tracks him down, Beth punches him publicly, cries to Mare privately (“God forgive me, but sometimes I wish he would just fucking die and get this over with”) and declines to press charges. Mare tells a junior officer to phone the company that has illegally cut off his heating to get it restored and – limping on the ankle she sprained chasing him down – gets on with her day. It is an interlude that does little to further the plot, but is the essence of the series in microcosm:fully realised characters with deep, conflicting emotions, united in the face of encroaching forces greater than themselves.</p> <p>The main arc weaves through this perfectly conjured study of a community and how it endures. Neither seems secondary to the other. Mare of Easttown is as much about the psychology of terrible events and how they are absorbed by – and affect – those around them as it is about solving the crime at its heart.</p> <p>Erin (Cailee Spaeny), a single teenage mother (although, again, nothing like the TV drama stereotype) is found dead after the town’s young people congregated for a party in the woods. Erin had left early, having been beaten up by Brianna (Mackenzie Lansing, the vicious girlfriend of her baby’s father, Dylan) and stumbled away to her unwitting doom.</p> <p>The town, now with one missing and one murdered girl, is deeply disturbed. A new investigation into the former is ordered alongside the new murder case and a county detective, Colin Zabel (Evan Peters, in an impressive change of pace since he was seen as Pietro in WandaVision), brought in to assist Mare. Through him, we see the limitation and the flaws in the policing and practices in a small town, as well as the benefits. It is another layer of complicating interest in a show that has already generously provided.</p> <p>Add a love interest for Mare, in the form of the writer and guest lecturer Richard Ryan (Guy Pearce, playing him with just the right amount of easy, intelligent charm); Mare’s daughter, Siobhan, keeping her sexuality a secret from her overstretched mother; and Mare’s ex-husband, Frank, getting engaged to his girlfriend and there is almost too much to enjoy. </p> <p>As the twists and turns of the cases are revealed, it becomes a show greater than the sum of its already considerable parts. By the time you get to the revelation at the end of the second episode, you become less stunned by the news itself than you are by the computation of what it will mean for all involved. Everything and everyone is real and you care about every tiny part. Wonderful.",False,pillar/arts,Arts,['woman+murder']

This equated to twice as many permits as normal – and marked the highest ratio of any season so far.</p> <p>State authorities had a total culling goal of 200 wolves, in an attempt to stabilize their population. As Native American tribes claimed a quota of 81 wolves, this left 119 for the state-licensed trappers and hunters. Because the tribes consider wolves sacred, they typically use their allotment to protect, not kill, them.</p> <p>“Should we, would we, could we have [closed the season] sooner? Yes.” Eric Lobner, DNR wildlife director, said, according to the Journal Sentinel.</p> <p>“Did we go over? We did. Was that something we wanted to have happen? Absolutely not.”</p> <p>The overshoot, which has never exceeded 10 wolves in prior seasons, spurred criticism.</p> <p>Megan Nicholson, who directs Wisconsin’s chapter of the Humane Society of the United States, commented in a statement: “This is a deeply sad and shameful week for Wisconsin.”</p> <p>She added: “This week’s hunt proves that now, more than ever, gray wolves need federal protections restored to protect them from short-sighted and lethal state management,” Nicholson also said.</p> <p>This hunt comes in the wake of federal policy, and local litigation, that stripped gray wolves of protection.</p> <p>In the 1950s gray wolves, which are native to Wisconsin, were extirpated from the state due to years of unregulated hunting. Heightened protections, such as the federal 1973 Endangered Species Act, helped the population rebound.</p> <p>Following the implementation of these protections, gray wolves emerged and spread from a northern Minnesota “stronghold”, the Journal Sentinel <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/outdoors/2021/02/02/lawsuit-filed-against-wisconsin-dnr-over-failure-hold-wolf-hunt/4352188001/"">said</a>.</p> <p>The implications of these protections were sweeping: while the gray wolf population had dropped to about 1,000 by the 1970s, the number now totals about 6,000 in the lower 48 states.</p> <p>The gray wolf was delisted for protection in 2012, however. Wisconsin officials subsequently provided three hunting and trapping seasons. In 2012, 117 wolves were killed; in 2013, 257; and in 2014, 154.</p> <p>A federal judge, in response to a lawsuit from wildlife advocates, decided in December 2014 that the gray wolf must be put back on the Endangered Species List. In October 2020, the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration"">Trump administration</a> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/29/gray-wolf-endangered-species-trump-administration"">removed</a> the gray wolf from the Endangered Species List.</p> <p>A Kansas-based hunting advocacy group filed suit against Wisconsin’s department of natural resources in January over its decision not to provide a gray wolf hunting or trapping season this winter. This legal action reportedly “forced” the department to hold a season before February ended.</p> <p>The season was also the first to take place in February, the gray wolf’s breeding season. Advocates have worried that killing pregnant wolves could have an even greater impact on their population, possibly disrupting packs.</p> <p>Because officials rushed to open the season, there was dramatically limited opportunity for legally mandated consultation with Native American tribes, the newspaper also notes.</p> <p>“This season trampled over the tribes’ treaty rights, the Wisconsin public and professional wildlife stewardship,” a representative for the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission reportedly said.",False,pillar/news,News,['honor killing']

Between 2000 and 2016 the number of women in prison increased by 53%, growing at twice the rate of the total prison population and more than twice the rate of the general population.</p> <p>In Australia, researchers have identified two possible causes for the increase: either women are suddenly committing more serious crimes and therefore getting more jail time, or laws and policing practices have shifted so that minor crimes are now met with more severe penalties.</p> <p>The tightening of bail laws, use of mandatory sentencing, and a shift for longer sentences for drug offences are among the reasons that the female prison population may be increasing, says the president of the Australian Law Council, Pauline Wright.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""dc68779bc42a03f08a260218bc3d456824ba4781""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/dc68779bc42a03f08a260218bc3d456824ba4781/0_107_6622_3975/1000.jpg"" alt=""Frances Drake spent three years on remand at Silverwater correctional centre.

And so what we’ve tried to do by putting out this report is to shed a light on just how many of these vulnerabilities these women experience.”</p> <p>Responses collated from 117 women found that the highest level of education most women had attained was year 10 or a trade certificate. One in four were unemployed and looking for work in the 30 days prior to being incarcerated, and just 15% were in full or part-time work or study.

It’s important that the needs of those people, particularly women, are considered upon release.”</p> <p>Women entering prison often already had complex health needs, says Ritson. Almost half of all women surveyed described their mental health on entry to prison as fair or poor, and 40% described their physical health as fair or poor. More than a third had been diagnosed with a chronic condition, 86% smoked, and 74% had used illicit drugs in the past 12 months – particularly methamphetamines. Just 1% of the general population has tried methamphetamine, but 61% of prison entrants reported using it.</p> <p>More than a third reported having a head injury that resulted in them being knocked unconscious at some point in their lives, and 15% experienced ongoing symptoms related to that head injury.</p> <p>“That can be as a result of their own experiences of violence through their life,” says Ritson. “It’s a really worrying and troubling finding.”</p> <p>Davis says she turned her time into a positive experience, but still experiences daily “feelings of self-hate and guilt” over the death of her partner. She received permission for her five-month old son to stay with her at Emu Plains correctional centre in NSW, and used her time in jail to qualify as an alcohol and drugs counsellor, and to grieve the loss of three siblings to suicide – two died before she entered jail, and her brother died while she was incarcerated.

And, over the past three decades, there have been few more reassuring faces than Huw Edwards, the 59-year-old presenter of BBC One’s <em>News at Ten</em>. During the pandemic, ratings of the nightly bulletin have shot up, often topping 6 million viewers. Edwards, meanwhile, has had an eventful 2020: in March, he had Covid himself; in the summer, he became a social media meme with #dothehuw. A proud Welshman, he has five children with his wife Vicky Flind, editor of ITV’s <em>Peston</em>, and lives in south London.</p> <p><strong>What’s behind the ratings boost that </strong><em><strong>News at Ten</strong></em><strong>, and other news programmes, have had this year?<br></strong>With so much crap and misinformation out there on various platforms, I think it’s good that people have turned to broadcast news as a trusted source. Now, I know that we sometimes annoy people. And I know that we sometimes get stuff wrong. But at a time of crisis, if people were not turning to us, I’d be very worried, because that would be the ultimate proof that we’d lost people’s trust.</p> <p><strong>How</strong><strong> has 2020 been for you personally?<br></strong>A bit of a struggle, if I’m going to be blunt. I was very ill for a couple of weeks, then I went back to work, which I was pleased to do, but I get very, very breathless if I run up a flight of stairs. There’s a double-floored spiral staircase from the makeup area and one evening I’d gone into the studio at 9.50pm, quite late for me, and I couldn’t speak. I thought: “Oh my God, I’m not going to be able to do the show.” As soon as I’d done the headlines, and I was into the show, I calmed down a bit. But that was a good example of the after-effects.</p> <p><strong>There’s been </strong><strong>further discussion about BBC salaries this year. You took a 20% pay cut, but are still one of the highest-paid presenters. How does it feel to have your salary scrutinised like that?<br></strong>Look, if you say to anyone: “Do you fancy a 20% cut in your pay?”, I think you know what the answer is going to be. But I decided that, if you’re going to have your photo plastered everywhere as a high-earner, the very least you can do – not that it will impress many people – is to make a gesture, which in my case was quite a significant gesture. And I’ve done it because I think it’s the right thing to do. I wasn’t bullied into it. If they came back and asked for another 20%, I’m not promising it would be the same response.</p> <p><strong>You have become well</strong><strong> known for the signature pose you adopt at the start of bulletins: eyes down, arms across your body. It’s even got a hashtag: <a href=""https://twitter.com/huwbbc/status/1276906990401474560"">#dothehuw</a>. When you didn’t do it recently, someone on social media asked</strong><strong>: “Has the Queen died?”<br></strong>So, I’ll tell you what happened that night. There was a gang of students in Birmingham, five or six girls in a flat, and they DMed me: “Oh, come on, brighten up our evening, do something different at the start of the <em>Ten</em>.” It was ridiculous. All I did was just clasp my hands in front of me. Anyway, they said they were “made up”, which I’m told is rather a good thing. And they’ve got a horrible photo of me up on their wall, which has got tinsel around it in a heart shape. So, just to show, when the BBC says I’m not reaching a young audience, I’m doing rather better than they are!</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""f1c372df7ce07e125e5f5746f8738ad5af9de88b""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/f1c372df7ce07e125e5f5746f8738ad5af9de88b/0_137_2048_1229/1000.jpg"" alt=""Huw Edwards in his classic #dothehuw pose."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Huw Edwards in his classic #dothehuw pose.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You feature </strong><strong>in a</strong><strong> forthcoming </strong><em><strong>GQ</strong></em><strong> list of stylish men. How much do you think about your appearance?<br></strong>More than I used to. In my 30s and 40s, actually not at all. I look at some photos of myself then, thinking: “What on Earth are you doing?” With a terrible haircut and a bad suit. One thing was, I’d been to the same hairdresser for years and he retired. So there’s a Turkish barber just around the corner from work, and I just walked in one day and he said: “Your hair is actually terrible.” I said: “OK, but bear in mind that, if this looks bad, I literally can’t go to work.” Anyway, he did me a bit of a favour.</p> <p><strong>What did you do with your hair during lockdown then?<br></strong>I had a slightly disastrous shaving session with what’s known as a Wahl trimmer, which I bought off Amazon. And when it got quite long, I had to put so much product in my hair… Honestly, if you’d put me in a gale-force wind, not a single hair would have moved.</p> <p><strong>You have five grown</strong><strong>up children. What lessons can you pass on about parenthood?<br></strong>There’s a principle that your youngest child gets a far better crack of the whip than your eldest. All your anxieties and inexperience and cluelessness as a parent are taken out on your eldest child. By the time you get to your youngest, in my case number five, you’re a brilliant parent. So if you could give a parent all the patience and knowledge that they would have with their second or third child or whatever to the first, that’s the one piece of advice I’d give.</p> <p><strong>Are you a fan of festive games?<br></strong>This is a terrible thing to confess, but I detest these games. At the end of Christmas lunch, there’s a big charades thing going on, and I’d rather just sip my wine and watch. I’m a grumpy old Welshman, as my daughter tells me. So I’m true to form. <br",False,pillar/news,News,['child abuse']

Zarini further alleges he exposed his own genitals to her and rubbed them against her.</p> <p>Zarini also claims that Patricia Gucci not only allowed her former stepfather to continue the alleged molestation but that Palombo instructed her “to keep quiet and cover them up”, the lawsuit states.</p> <p>Both women, Patricia Gucci and Palombo, the lawsuit continues, “tried to avoid, at all costs, what they perceived would be a scandal that could tarnish the Gucci name and potentially cost them millions”.</p> <p>The lawsuit also accuses her mother of hitting and sometimes trying to strangle her daughter. Her then husband, Ruffalo, would then “rescue” his stepdaughter and allegedly abuse her under the pretense of being her protector.</p> <p>Zarini claims she knew abuse was coming when she heard the ice clinking in his glass of scotch as Ruffalo made his way toward her bedroom. She also claims Ruffalo encouraged her in the use of cocaine and crystal meth.</p> <p>“If you think this doesn’t happen here in Beverly Hills, then you should know that my perpetrator still lives in California, spends time at the Bel-Air country club and volunteers in your children’s hospitals,” Zarini said in a <a href=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IF9JVNdgfdI"">video released</a> by her lawyers.</p> <p>“This is not something that only happens to other families, other neighborhoods or other countries. It is everywhere.”</p> <p>The paper confirmed that Zarini had filed a report outlining alleged abuse with the Beverly Hills police department. The paper confirmed that the police file remains open. The filing of the 21-page lawsuit was paired with the launch of the heiress’s anti-child abuse non-profit, the <a href=""https://www.guccifoundation.org/"">Alexandra Gucci Children’s Foundation</a>.</p> <p>In a statement Patricia Gucci said she was “deeply sorry for the pain Joseph Ruffalo caused Alexandra”.</p> <p>“What he did to her is inexcusable and I was devastated when she disclosed everything to me at our family doctor’s office in London in September 2007. I immediately initiated divorce proceedings against Mr Ruffalo and set about healing my family through counseling.”</p> <p>However, Patricia Gucci, who lives in Switzerland, denied Zarini’s allegations against her and Palombo. “I am equally devastated by the allegations against me and her grandmother, which are completely false,” she told the paper.</p> <p>A legal representative for Ruffalo said that his client had not been served with legal papers and could not respond directly to the allegations. “What he has been informed of, he vehemently and categorically denies,” Richard Crane, the lawyer, said.</p> <p>Crane added that while married to Zarini’s mother, both “were greatly concerned about the mental wellbeing of Alexandra and took steps to address her instability”.</p> <p>“Apparently, their efforts failed,” Crane added.</p> <p>The lawsuit adds a new chapter of controversy to the storied Gucci family, which relinquished its stake in the business in 1993. The Gucci brand is currently owned by the French luxury conglomerate Kering, which reported more than $18bn in revenue in 2019. About $11bn of that is attributed to Gucci.</p> <p>Over the years, the Gucci family has been embroiled in tax evasion, feuds and murder.</p> <p>In 2016, Zarini’s mother published a memoir, <a href=""https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/a15550/patricia-gucci-interview/"" title="""">In the Name of Gucci</a> that detailed how her mother and father, Aldo Gucci, who was already married with a family, kept their relationship secret.</p> <p>In 1986, Gucci, then 81, was <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/12/nyregion/gucci-81-gets-year-in-prison-in-federal-tax-case.html"" title="""">convicted of tax evasion</a> and served a year in prison. His daughter subsequently married, had two children including Alexandra, divorced and then started a relationship with Ruffalo.</p> <p>Also in the family’s file of dysfunction is a plot to murder Maurizio Gucci, grandson of patriarch Guccio Gucci and the one-time head of the fashion house, orchestrated by his ex-wife, Patrizia Reggiani.</p> <p>Reggiani was tried and convicted of orchestrating her ex-husband’s assassination on the steps of his office in Italy in 1995, gaining the nickname the Black Widow during the trial. Reggiani served 18 years before being released from prison in 2016. That story is currently being <a href=""https://variety.com/2019/film/news/lady-gaga-gucci-murder-movie-ridley-scott-1203390294/"">dramatized in a film</a> starring Lady Gaga and directed by Ridley Scott.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the US, Rainn offers support at 800-656-4673 or by chat at www.rainn.org.

The last one was a minor. He was from the other group; I saw when the police officer ask him where he was from. He tried to say that he is a minor.

His friends took him in their arms, and one of the police officers ordered them to lay him down on the ground. Then they started hitting them with batons.

Biden has revoked some Trump-era asylum measures and children who were being turned away two months ago are now being processed because Biden stopped a rule known as Title 42 from being applied to children.</p> \n  <p>It is also believed that at least some of the unaccompanied children initially approached the border with parents or other family members and were turned away, leading some families to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/10/joe-biden-immigration-policies-trump-roll-back"">send their children alone</a> to improve their chances of entering the US. The border patrol also separates many children who are with non-parents, even when those adults may be the child’s primary guardian.<br></p> \n  <p>For children seeking asylum on their own, the first step is to contact a border patrol official either at a legal port of entry or while trying to cross the border outside those checkpoints. Those unaccompanied children are supposed to be moved within three days out of border patrol custody to the health department’s office of refugee resettlement’s (ORR) network of shelters. From there, they are placed with a sponsor, usually a family member or friend already living in the US while their legal cases play out.</p> \n  <p>Child welfare experts say it is essential children are moved to a sponsor as quickly as possible - but it is not happening very<strong> </strong>efficiently. As of Monday, nearly 1,400 children had been in border patrol custody for more than three days, <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/migrant-children-border-patrol-custody-past-legal-limit/"">according to CBS News.</a> In a call with reporters on Wednesday, CBP officials would not provide information on how many children were in its custody and concerns are growing about the number of children detained in border patrol facilities.</p> \n  <p>Troy Miller, the acting CBP commissioner, said: “We’re doing everything that is possible to move the children out of our custody as quickly as we should, in a safe and healthy manner.”</p> \n  <p><strong>Read more of Amanda Holpuch’s analysis here: <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/12/unaccompanied-child-migrants-joe-biden-explainer"">What is Joe Biden doing to cope with a rise in unaccompanied child migrants?</a></strong></p> \n  <aside class=""element element-rich-link""> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/12/unaccompanied-child-migrants-joe-biden-explainer"">What is Joe Biden doing to cope with a rise in unaccompanied child migrants?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=""block-604b348d8f0849a7378fd8bb"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> \n <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2021-03-12T11:35:29.324Z"">11.35am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=""block-elements""> \n  <p>According to Congressional Budget Office estimates, to pay out his coronavirus relief package, president <strong>Joe Biden</strong> must spend an average of $3.7 billion every day for the rest of this year. That’s $43,000 every second of every day until midnight chimes on 2022.</p> \n  <p>Josh Boak at the Associated Press reports that the president signed the aid package into law yesterday without a comprehensive plan in place to distribute all of the funds, which will be a core focus of the administration in coming weeks.</p> \n  <p>“It’s taxpayer money that you want to put out fairly, but you also want to put out fast,” said Jack Smalligan, a senior policy fellow at the Urban Institute and a former White House budget official.<br></p> \n  <p>Some spending, such as cash transfers, can occur at speed. The Biden administration already announced that it will send the $1,400 in direct checks - a total of about $400 billion-starting this weekend. The administration also will continue the enhanced jobless aid for the 20.1 million Americans who are collecting some form of the benefits. Both the direct checks and jobless aid were part of past Covid aid packages that totaled roughly $4 trillion, meaning the government has systems in place to distribute the money.</p> \n  <p>But other elements are trickier. There is $130 billion for K-12 schools to hire teachers, upgrade ventilation systems and make other improvements so that in-person classes can resume. Universities are eligible for $40 billion. Separately, $30 billion in housing aid is available. And there is about $120 billion for vaccine distribution and coronavirus testing, among other public health expenses. The White House said the billions for schools would “begin” to be distributed this month by the Education Department.</p> \n  <p>But some funds could take time to distribute, since government agencies with their normal spending can take six to nine months to release funds through competitive grants or an application process. Schools and state and local governments also might spread out spending to well after most of the country is vaccinated.<br></p> \n  <p>“A fair process can inherently take longer because of the checks and balances and the internal reviews,” Smalligan said. “Having the money flow out quickly and then having state and local government spend the money over the next two fiscal years is probably responsible on their part. You want to be hiring a teacher not for a month but for years.”</p> \n  <p>The Treasury Department is planning how to best distribute roughly $350 billion in state and local aid. But it hasn’t finalized a plan and is consulting with governors, mayors and other officials.<br></p> \n  <p>“Our Treasury team is going to work to get this aid out as in the quickest way possible - and the one that produces the greatest impact,” Treasury Secretary <strong>Janet Yellen</strong> said at a Tuesday speech for the National League of Cities. “To do that, we’re going to need your input and advice.”<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=""block-604b4b1e8f0849a7378fd9ff"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> \n <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2021-03-12T11:10:36.620Z"">11.10am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=""block-elements""> \n  <p>Also away from domestic politics for a moment, president <strong>Joe Biden</strong> and fellow leaders of the Indo-Pacific alliance known as the Quad are set this morning to announce a plan to expand coronavirus vaccine manufacturing capacity in India, according to administration officials.</p> \n  <p><strong>They will hold a virtual meeting of the leaders of Australia, India, Japan and the US today, and it comes as the Biden administration is putting greater emphasis on the Indo-Pacific region in the face of growing economic competition from China.</strong></p> \n  <p>Secretary of state <strong>Antony Blinken</strong> and Defense secretary <strong>Lloyd J Austin III</strong> are travelling to the region at the weekend in their first overseas trips in the role. <br></p> \n  <p>Associated Press report that the effort by the alliance to pump up India’s vaccine manufacturing also comes as the Biden administration and leaders of other wealthy nations have faced calls from France and some global health advocacy groups to donate a small percentage of vaccine produced in the US and other industrialized nations to poor countries.</p> \n  <p>The Biden administration says it is focused on making sure that all Americans are first vaccinated, but has made a $4 billion commitment to COVAX, an international effort to bolster the purchase and distribution of coronavirus vaccines to poor nations.</p> \n  <p>“If we have a surplus, we’re going to share it with the rest of the world,” Biden said earlier this week at an event where he announced that the U.S. had acquired an additional 100 million doses.</p> \n  <p>The effort by the Quad is projected to allow India to increase manufacturing capacity by 1 billion doses by 2022, according to two senior administration officials who briefed reporters ahead of the meeting.<br></p> \n  <p>The issue of China is sure to loom large in the meeting. Each of the four nations has a complex, if not strained, relationship with China, and Biden, in his calls with each of the leaders during the first weeks of his administration, has stressed the need for cooperation on China.</p> \n  <p>The White House is also expected to announce on Friday that Biden will host Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga for the first in-person foreign leader visit of his presidency, according to a senior administration official.

It’s been just under a year since Donald Trump set an ambitious goal for moving beyond the coronavirus, aiming to have things fully open again by an upcoming holiday: Easter 2020. Biden gave another holiday for which to aim: 4 July 2021. Biden cast it as a chance to “not only mark our independence as a nation, but we begin to mark our independence from this virus.” </p> \n   <p><strong>Some stern words for skeptics</strong>. With some states moving away from mask mandates and many Americans — especially Republicans — still resisting even voluntary masking, Biden labeled it the “easiest thing to do to save lives,” sounding a bit exasperated while adding “sometimes it divides us.”</p> \n   <p><strong>Pumping up his vaccine record — a bit too much</strong>. The biggest early test of his administration has been the vaccine rollout. But as has been the case before, Biden’s effort to pitch it as a success story was overstated.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On that last point Blake elaborates:</p> \n  <blockquote class=""quoted""> \n   <p>When Biden came into office, there had already been several days of 1 million people being vaccinated — the daily number required to hit 100 million in 100 days. In other words, to hit the goal, he mostly just needed to keep things moving in the direction they were going. There is always some game-playing when it comes to setting expectations and then beating them, and vaccines continue to ramp up. But casting this as some unthinkable feat goes too far and detracts from legitimate claims to success.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Read more here: <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/11/takweaways-biden-address/""><strong>Washington Post – 3 takeaways from Biden’s first prime-time address to the nation</strong></a></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=""block-604b23aa8f08089f0d4affe8"" class=""block is-key-event"" data-block-contributor=""""> \n <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2021-03-12T10:24:59.549Z"">10.24am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=""block-title"">Biden says all Americans vaccine eligible by 1 May</h2> \n <div class=""block-elements""> \n  <p><strong>Joe Biden pledged yesterday that all US adults will be eligible for coronavirus vaccines by 1 May</strong>, as he addressed the nation on the one year anniversary of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Do not read on unless you have watched season eight, episodes one and two.</em></p> <p>It’s hard to fathom that in just four weeks Spiral will be gone from our screens for good. Fifteen years, an eight-season run and international acclaim is a good outcome for a French drama. It’s kept a high standard throughout, with its signature blend of cerebral procedural and high-octane cops and robbers. Laure Berthaud and her crew of roughnecks will be missed – especially BTL on this blog.</p> <h2><strong>The laundromat murder</strong></h2> <p>The fallout from <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/16/spiral-recap-season-seven-episodes-11-and-12-the-finale"">l’affaire Gilou</a> continues to rain down on our heroes. Three months of criminal chump change have left the gang frustrated and forlorn. What better way to get back in the game than to take on a messy murder guaranteed to make them even less popular? When a dead kid shows up in a tumble dryer, Laure is all over that action like caramelised onion on a croissant.</p> <p>The unfortunate youth, known nominally as Shkun, was part of a loose collective of undocumented minors from Morocco, living in squats and running wild in the 18th arrondissement. Early suspect Souleymane spends his days mugging tourists and his nights bombed on benzos. He is not above violence against his friends, either, as the assault on Shkun reveals. However, when his laser-tag alibi exonerates him of murder, we are forced to look elsewhere for the culprit.</p> <p>The white van that spirits Souleymane away suggests exploitation by organised crime. Bigger players seem certain to enter the fray.</p> <h2><strong>Gilou</strong></h2> <p>That perennial survivor Escoffier is already making a big impression in prison. Turning down the protective custody offered to incarcerated flics, he settles down into gen pop, targeting le grand fromage of the wing, Cisco. A summary beatdown followed by a high-risk bait-and-switch on Cisco’s phone leads to an intense steak-and-chill session in the Romanian’s cell. Cisco is quietly impressed that Gilou never ratted out his colleagues. Gilou is quietly impressed with the tender yet flavourful rump he is presented with. Lovers of bromance will be disappointed, however, as Gilou is working an angle – getting close to Cisco to try and pin a revenge murder on him. Brémont hints that when Cisco gets out in two days, Gilou may be exiting with him to pull off the sting. Two career criminals back on the street – the French justice system continues to perplex.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""02936ebb56ccce639ca26c3b482a848158a6178d""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/02936ebb56ccce639ca26c3b482a848158a6178d/0_0_3543_2126/1000.jpg"" alt=""Spiral season 8 ...

Like Tintin before him, Ali despairs at the secrets-and-lies culture Laure perpetuates. Whether or not her (literally) phoned-in apology will get him back on board remains to be seen. When she tries to bond with new face Judge Lucie Bourdieu she immediately rubs her up the wrong way. That’s Laure for you – making enemies in high places wherever she goes.</p> <h2><strong>Joséphine</strong></h2> <p>If the early indications were that domesticity with Lola had blunted Joséphine’s edges, we are quickly disabused of that notion once she catches a glimpse of herself in the smart, feral Souleymane. She can still sniff a procedural infraction from 500 yards and with a flourish of her gown she gets the youngster out of custody and into child protection. The same old Joséphine, then? Not quite. The trauma of the last two seasons has left its mark – she now specialises in rape cases, presumably advocating for the victims.

A senior Labour source said ministers had not adequately explained how it would work, its purpose and the cost to the taxpayer. Forty Tory MPs have pledged to oppose certificates as “divisive and discriminatory”, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/apr/06/keir-starmer-likely-to-oppose-covid-status-certificates-if-put-to-vote"">potentially wiping out the government’s majority</a>. Under the scheme, only people who can prove they have had a coronavirus vaccine, a recent negative test, or antibodies from an infection in the last six months would be <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/05/what-are-covid-status-certificates-and-how-might-they-work"">allowed into some settings</a> such as theatres and sports stadiums. Starmer has said he thinks the idea runs against British instinct.</p> \n<p>Johnson has suggested that Covid status certificates and mass weekly testing <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/05/boris-johnson-confirms-easing-of-england-lockdown-next-week"">could be key to further easing of restrictions</a>, as he gave the green light for pubs, shops, hairdressers and gyms to reopen across England from next Monday. The PM said this next step out of lockdown was “fully justified” by the success of the vaccine rollout and the drop in cases and hospitalisations. Hopes that foreign holidays may be allowed from 17 May were dampened as Johnson said he did “not wish to give hostages to fortune” and was nervous about “the virus being reimported” from abroad given the surge in cases across Europe.

Police said the body had been discovered in a pond and identification efforts were under way. Okorogheye, a student of computer science at Oxford Brookes University, has not been seen by his family since 22 March, when he left his home in Ladbroke Grove, west London. He took a bus and a taxi to Loughton in Essex where he was last seen on CCTV near Epping Forest. He has sickle cell disease and had been shielding at home during the pandemic. The Met said Okorogheye’s family were being supported by officers and kept aware of developments.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>‘That should have stopped’ – </strong>The Minneapolis police chief, Medaria Arradondo, has told the Derek Chauvin murder trial he <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/05/derek-chauvin-trial-police-chief-medaria-arradondo"">“vehemently disagrees” there was any justification</a> for the former police officer to keep his knee on George Floyd’s neck for more than nine minutes. “Once Mr Floyd had stopped resisting, and certainly once he was in distress and trying to verbalise that, that should have stopped.”</p> \n<figure class=""element element-atom""> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=""b58f9145-044f-4caa-a56c-76c0f7ccb9c2"" data-atom-type=""media""> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GqYb6xd3zQY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0""></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It is highly unusual for a police chief to give evidence against one of his own officers. Arradondo, his city’s first black police chief, fired Chauvin shortly after Floyd’s death. Dr Bradford Wankhede Langenfeld, the emergency room doctor who tried to save Floyd’s life, has <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/05/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-doctor-asphyxiation"">told the trial he most likely died of asphyxiation</a>. He saw no evidence Floyd was killed by a heart attack or a drug overdose as Chauvin’s defence has claimed. Chauvin, 45, has denied charges of second- and third-degree murder, and manslaughter. The trial continues.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Northern Ireland roils – </strong>Violence has <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/apr/05/further-violence-breaks-out-in-northern-ireland-despite-appeals-for-calm"">continued in Northern Ireland</a> where tensions have soared among loyalists over post-Brexit trading arrangements. A car was set alight in Sperrin Park in the Waterside area of Derry on Monday night while there were reports of violent incidents in Carrickfergus, near Belfast. On Sunday night five police officers sustained injuries after being pelted with petrol bombs and masonry in Belfast. In all, 32 police were injured in incidents in Derry and Belfast over the Easter weekend. In County Antrim a series of police drug seizures against the renegade South East Antrim UDA is thought to have contributed to disturbances in Newtownabbey. There is also anger over a decision not to prosecute 24 Sinn Féin politicians who attended a large-scale republican funeral during Covid-19 restrictions.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Be like Captain Tom – </strong>The family of the late Captain Sir Tom Moore are asking Britons to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/apr/06/family-of-captain-sir-tom-moore-issue-charity-challenge-to-nation"">embark on their own 100-something challenge</a> for charity.

Born in Bradford, she has made <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=anita+rani+india+documentary&amp;oq=Anita+Rani+India+do&amp;aqs=chrome.3.69i57j33i22i29i30l6.5480j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"">documentaries about India</a> inspired by her family background, danced the samba on <em>Strictly</em> (she later hosted the show’s live tour) and been a regular, much-loved presenter on the BBC’s <em>Countryfile</em>. She has just joined Radio 4’s <em><a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007qlvb"">Woman’s Hour</a></em>, presenting the show on Fridays and Saturdays.</p> <p><strong>How do you feel about your new role on </strong><em><strong>Woman’s Hour</strong></em><strong>?<br></strong>I’ve always listened to <em>Woman’s Hour</em>, even as a kid. My dad listened to Radio 4 in the car – I’d constantly try to get him to put it on Radio 1! It came out of the blue getting this gig, and I want to put my mark on it. I’ve got this amazing opportunity to talk to whoever I want to about topics that might not get looked at elsewhere, and to bring a vibrancy to a Friday. It’s a gift getting the Friday programme, because everyone is looking forward to the weekend. I see it as glossy magazine day. What do I want to do? Everything – it’s all up for grabs.</p> <p><strong>Would you describe yourself as a feminist – and did the traumatic discoveries you made on the BBC’s genealogy series </strong><em><strong><a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06fv8wf"">Who Do You Think You Are?</a></strong></em><strong> deepen your wish to champion women?<br></strong>One hundred per cent. I’ve always been a feminist, but something changed when I found out about my family’s history. My grandfather was in the British Indian army, stationed in Mumbai, when the partition of India happened. His family – father, wife and two children – were in Pakistan, on the wrong side of the border. None of them made it out alive. I came across horrific accounts of what happened to women. And the story of my grandfather’s first wife really affected me. I felt like I knew this woman and was channelling her story. The rumour was she had jumped down a well. But did she? Was she murdered? Or abducted and converted to Islam? I genuinely don’t know. These women’s stories were not told; they’re hidden in a shroud of shame.</p> <p><strong>The historian David Olusoga recently argued that the BBC needed a structural overhaul for more diversity and inclusivity. Do you agree?<br></strong>The industry needs to change. The whole country needs a structural overhaul. I live in Hackney, a partly gentrified area full of media companies – but how many of them employ kids from the local area? I often go on shoots where I’m the only northerner, never mind the only woman and brown person.</p> <p><strong>You’ve said you have to work twice as hard as a white person to be successful…<br></strong>Any non-white person will tell you this. This is how we were brought up: “Get your head down and work twice as hard to be even noticed.”</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>I want to ditch shame. I’ve spent a lifetime being told I need to be quiet, or that \'Girls should behave like this\'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You grew up in Bradford – how did this contribute to your character?<br></strong>Bradford made me… Obviously, I’m a Yorkshire lass so I’m going to bang on about Yorkshire. But it’s stunning, and growing up in that landscape… My parents worked really hard, they had a clothing manufacturing business. Me and my brother would help at the factory after school. And on Sundays, Dad would bundle us off to the moors for a Punjabi picnic. My grandad came to the UK in 1953, one of the first Indians in Bradford. My dad is a proper Yorkshireman, I’ve got his adventurous spirit and curiosity. My mum is Indian-Indian, she came in the 70s to marry Dad. As a kid, I had a conflicting identity, but now I own all of it – a healthy dose of Yorkshire and Punjabi.</p> <p><strong>You’re a</strong><strong> buoyant presenter</strong><strong>, but presumably you do feel down sometimes?<br></strong>What I want to bring to <em>Woman’s Hour</em> is warmth, humour and hope, particularly now, in such bleak times. But I do get down… I’m writing a childhood memoir, <em>The Right Sort of Girl</em>, so it’s all going to come out. The book’s premise is that you spend a lot of time trying to fit in, then lose the essence of who you are. I’d tell my 16-year-old self: don’t worry too much. I spent so long worrying. I was very driven, focused on making a life. I was torn between doing what I wanted and doing what I was told. I’d tell my younger self to do what she wanted more and not bend to do what people expected from her.</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pZ23eShemY""                                                                        >  <iframe height=""259"" width=""460"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0pZ23eShemY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pZ23eShemY"">Watch Rani dance the samba on Strictly Come Dancing</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>You have talked openly about your miscarriage – does the subject need more discussion?<br></strong>I don’t know whether it’s because we’re living through a pandemic, but something has changed in me. Increasingly, I want to ditch shame. I’ve spent a lifetime being told I need to be quiet, or that “Girls should behave like this,” or “Don’t bring shame on us”. Now I think: who am I shaming? More people are talking about miscarriage now, and we need to: one in four women in the UK suffer miscarriage. I’d no idea until I had my own. Nowadays, we’re encouraged to talk more about our identities. When I was growing up it was: assimilate, don’t rock the boat, don’t talk about your ethnicity – fit in. This is so detrimental to self-esteem. You find yourself bending in the workplace to make sure everyone else feels OK with who you are.</p> <p><strong>How have you fared during lockdown? </strong><strong><br></strong>Getting a dog has changed my life – she’s a Bedlington whippet. It’s been magical. I’ve never had a pet before, because Dad said it was cruel. But she has connected me to animals in a way I’ve never been – even as a <em>Countryfile</em> presenter. The only major problem is she wants to stick to us all the time. My husband will take her to work eventually.</p> <p><strong>What’s your greatest hope for the future?<br></strong>Same as everyone – that we sort this pandemic out. This is the hardest lockdown, winter has come and I’ve friends on the NHS frontline who are exhausted. What I want is for the world to free up a bit so we can go back to some sort of normality. And I’d quite like a holiday, dare I say it?<br></p> <p><em><a href=""https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-right-sort-of-girl/anita-rani/9781788704236"">The Right Sort of Girl will be published by Bonnier in July</a></em",False,pillar/arts,Arts,['woman+murder']

At 70, his energy puts mine to shame. He cycles everywhere. His diary is full. I’ve rarely interviewed someone so engaged (there are days when he emails me several times, each message more exacting than the last). But ask him a question and he’s unlikely to rush in. Certainty is not a given. His open-mindedness belongs to someone far younger. Above all, he is so calm: a reassuring presence. There are times during our conversation when it’s hard to believe we’re discussing experiences that must have caused him so much anxiety and even, at moments, some fear.</p> <p>Bell, a distinguished psychiatrist and practising psychoanalyst, is the doctor who in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/03/tavistock-centre-gender-identity-clinic-accused-fast-tracking-young-adults"" title="""">2018 wrote a controversial report </a>about the activities of the gender identity development service (GIDS), a clinic at the Tavistock and Portman NHS foundation trust in north London, where he worked in adult services from 1995 until his retirement earlier this year. GIDS, the only clinic of its kind in England, specialises in treating children with gender identity issues and in recent months has been in the news even more than usual. Last December, a judgment by the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/19/high-court-grants-leave-to-appeal-to-uk-gender-identity-service"" title="""">high court ruled </a>that those under the age of 16 were unlikely to be mature enough to give informed consent to the prescription of puberty blockers (such drugs delay the development of secondary sex characteristics in patients, in theory enabling children more easily to transition into their desired gender identity as an adult). This ruling, the result of a judicial review brought by 23-year-old Keira Bell – born female, she was prescribed blockers by GIDS at 16 and now regrets her transition – has effectively curtailed medical intervention for children with gender dysphoria. (The Tavistock is to appeal; the case will be heard in June. David Bell will be what is technically called an intervenor in the appeal, which means he can give evidence.)</p> <p>Bell’s report anticipated the concerns of the high court and he feels vindicated by its judgment. “It was jaw-dropping,” he says. “Because it was very strong.” As he read it, he was struck by details that have not been widely reported, particularly those involving a lack of data, a problem he had raised himself (GIDS was unable to produce for the court any data relating to outcomes and effects, whether desirable or adverse, in children who had been prescribed puberty blockers; nor could it provide details of the number and ages of children who had been given them). But the experience was painful, too: “I felt concerned that we’d moved away from the values [of care] the trust has embodied for so long.” He is astonished the judgment seems to have had so little effect on the organisation of GIDS. “Ordinarily, heads would roll,” he says. “The management structure has changed slightly, but it feels like window-dressing.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""a1d587f7693b6f17d8a98ab12a9e9e270440dce5""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/a1d587f7693b6f17d8a98ab12a9e9e270440dce5/0_3_4827_2897/1000.jpg"" alt=""Keira Bell outside the high court after its recent ruling on puberty blockers."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Keira Bell outside the high court after its recent ruling on puberty blockers.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But whatever the court’s verdict, it cannot change the fact that the organisation to which Bell devoted the greater part of his working life did not respect his rights as a whistleblower. Nor has it taken the heat out of the debate about the medical treatment of trans children – if anything, the discourse has only grown more entrenched – which is why he’s talking to me now. This is the first time he has spoken in detail about his experiences: about how he came to write his report and the grave consequences that doing so had for him. His retirement means that the threats of disciplinary action against him are over. He is free, at last, to say what he likes.</p> <p>Writing the report was, he says, a matter of conscience. In 2018, 10 GIDS staff brought their worries to him unsolicited, a figure he estimates to be around a third of those then working there. He had no choice but to act and would do the same again. Nevertheless, it was not easy. Far from being grateful to him for alerting it to a potentially dangerous situation, the trust’s position appeared defensive – having read the correspondence involved, perhaps aggressively so – almost from the start. It tried to silence him and instituted proceedings against him. Was he frightened? Yes and no. “I believed I was doing the right thing,” he says. “I never doubted that, and most of my colleagues in the adult department supported me, so when I went up to my floor at the Tavistock, I could be oblivious and get on with my work. The real betrayal wasn’t of me personally, but of the trust’s duty to whistleblowers and to its wider mission [since 1920, the Tavistock has specialised in talking cures]. But the thing that enables you to sleep at night is a good lawyer.” To pay for this lawyer, he launched two crowdfunding appeals.</p> <p>How, exactly, did the trust attempt to silence him? The trust told the <em>Observer</em> that it is proud of the GIDS service, which is committed to providing high-quality support and care for young people experiencing issues with gender dysphoria, and that the claims made by Dr Bell are historical and were dealt with following proper processes at the time. It vigorously denies that any steps were taken against Bell for being a whistleblower. It says that it has a duty to safeguard its staff, who have faced intense, personalised and upsetting harassment, and has taken a series of actions, following proper processes, to do this.</p> <p>By Bell’s telling, its approach was at once Kafkaesque and cack-handed. In the months after he delivered his report, a book to which he had written an introduction was removed from the Tavistock’s library. When he spoke at a conference about de-transition in Manchester, a member of GIDS’ staff travelled there, he says to spy on him. “They wrote it up very accurately,” he says, with a laugh. Finally, he was told that he was not allowed to write about, or to talk in public about, anything that wasn’t directly connected to his NHS employment, “which sounded odd to me… was it the case that if I was going to write a paper about the psychology of<em> King Lear</em>, I’d have to ask permission?” (As his lawyer informed him, this was against the terms of his contract.)</p> <p>The story begins in February 2018, with a knock on Bell’s office door. “I was often the person people came to when they had problems,” he says. Having worked as a consultant at the Tavistock for more than 25 years, he was one of its most senior doctors: for 10 years, he was in charge of its scientific programme; in 2018, he was also an elected staff governor of the trust, for the second time. Of the 10 GIDS staff who would talk to him over the course of the next seven months, only the first saw Bell at the Tavistock; the others, who spoke of intimidation, worried about being seen. What did he make of what they told him? “My blood ran cold. Their concerns were similar, but not in a choreographed way. One or two were severely troubled.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""049d50ab731cab500fb1ebc2dcb10ff5454181ca""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/049d50ab731cab500fb1ebc2dcb10ff5454181ca/0_417_5051_3030/1000.jpg"" alt=""The Tavistock Centre in north London."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The Tavistock Centre in north London.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among these concerns were the fact that children attending GIDS often seemed to be rehearsed and sometimes did not share their parents’ sense of urgency; that senior staff spoke of “straightforward cases” in terms of children who were to be put on puberty blockers (no case of gender dysphoria, notes Bell, can be said to be straightforward); that some were recommended for treatment after just two appointments and seen only infrequently thereafter; some felt that GIDS employed too many inexperienced (and inexpensive) psychologists; that clinicians who’d spoken of homophobia in the unit were told they had “personal issues”. One told Bell that a child as young as eight had been referred to an endocrinologist for treatment. “I could not go on like this… I could not live with myself given the poor treatment the children were obtaining,” said another.</p> <p>Was he surprised? How much did he know about GIDS before these conversations? (The clinic, which was established in 1989, had grown hugely during his time. In 2009, it saw 80 patients. By 2019, this figure had risen to 2,700.) “That’s a good question. It started as a small service, then it became nationally funded; a contract with NHS England meant a guaranteed income. It was peculiar. You could see that everyone knew about it and yet no one wanted to know about it. In the adult department, there was a sense that we didn’t want to find out what went on there, because we might not have liked it if we did.”</p> <p>Bell wondered what he should do. “In July, I met with hospital management. I told them I would write a report. They said: OK. While I was writing it, I contacted GIDS. I needed to know some basic stuff: the number of patients they’d seen; their gender; what psychiatric problems they may have had.” He received no answers. “I then got a rather unpleasant letter from Paul Jenkins, the trust’s chief executive. It said that GIDS was very busy and that its staff were not obliged to answer me.” Was it that GIDS didn’t have the data or that it didn’t want Bell to have it? “Both.”</p> <p>In September, Bell sent his report to Jenkins and to Paul Burstow, the chairman of the board. For unspecified legal reasons, he says, they forbade him to send it to the council of governors, which oversees the board. “That was when I got myself a lawyer,” says Bell. His lawyer told him that, on the contrary, a failure to send it out might make him culpable in the event of any future legal case taken against the trust. When he did so, however, he received what felt like a “very hostile and threatening” note from Burstow. Nevertheless, the report was discussed at the next council, where it was agreed that a review of GIDS would be led by Dinesh Sinha, the trust’s medical director. In spite of this, in November 2018, Bell received two letters threatening disciplinary action. One of the grounds was “bullying”. He was not told whom he had bullied. He was also asked to agree not to speak any further to Sonia Appleby, the trust’s director of child safeguarding. (Appleby is bringing a whistleblowing claim against the trust in which she alleges that when she made “protected disclosures” regarding concerns raised by GIDS staff over patient safety, she was subjected to detriments.)</p> <p>While Sinha’s review was taking place, Bell asked for its terms of reference. He wanted to ensure that those who’d talked to him could speak to the review safely, that their anonymity would be protected. He says he got no response. Bell wrote to staff at GIDS, reminding them of their right, as NHS workers, to speak confidentially. At this point, he says, the trust “went ballistic… they interfered with my emails so I couldn’t write to them again”. The trust’s review delivered its report in February 2019. Initially, Bell was not allowed to see it. He was then given 30 minutes to read its 70 pages (it was later leaked to him in full). “There was still no data. It mentioned intimidation, but no action was [to be] taken. However, it did acknowledge the inappropriate involvement of trans ideology groups in the work of the service.” The report was approved by the board and the council of governors, although one consultant psychotherapist, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/23/child-transgender-service-governor-quits-chaos"" title="""">Marcus Evans</a>, accused the trust of having an “overvalued belief” in GIDS expertise and resigned. Soon after this, Bell’s report was leaked to the press. “That disturbed me, until I read [the article],” he says. “The reporting was accurate. I started to think it was a good thing.” He says the trust began to suggest that Bell was unqualified to write such a report and to suggest that the cases in it were hypothetical. (They were not.)</p> <p>In early 2020, procedures were set up for disciplinary action to be taken against Bell. “All the grounds were in connection with my activities as a whistleblower,” he says. In the meantime, Bell announced that he would retire, as he’d always planned to, in June 2020. But then the pandemic hit; wanting to see his unit through it, he decided to delay his departure until January 2021. The trust attempted more than once to set a date for the hearing, but these were always dropped. Bell felt all this was just for show.</p> <p> His retirement was only weeks away.</p> <p>Last January, he retired as planned, only a month after the Keira Bell judgment. He had long believed a case would be brought against the trust, though he thought the most likely scenario was that a former patient would sue for damages (Keira Bell instigated a judicial review). “It was inevitable,” he says. “I warned the trust of this.” But the Keira Bell judgment has done little to alleviate his concerns. Whatever the outcome of the appeal, he believes more questions must be asked, particularly about the rise in the number of girls presenting at the clinic (three-quarters of patients are now girls; the gender balance used to be closer to 50:50). “We do not know why this is happening.” He worries that too much emphasis is placed on gender and not enough on sexuality – “the children are often gay” – and he continues to be anxious about co-morbidities such as anorexia, autism and history of trauma in its patients. “Some of the children are depressed. It’s said that it’s their gender that is the cause of this, but how do we know? And why don’t we try to treat that first?”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""4624bbc0244bebc7d33205db9f1cb8c0f94894b6""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/4624bbc0244bebc7d33205db9f1cb8c0f94894b6/0_1006_4480_5599/800.jpg"" alt=""Bell says the trust threatened him with disciplinary action after he published his critical report."" width=""800"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">‘Consent is the issue here, nothing else,’ says Bell.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bell is not against puberty blockers per se – “a doctor should never say never” – but he believes that halting puberty only makes it more frightening to the child: “The child will never want to come off the hormones and 98% do now stay on them. This could be a dangerous collusion on the part of the doctor. The body is not a video machine. You can’t just press a pause button. You have to ask what it really means to stop puberty.” It should be possible, he believes, to manage the distress of a child who is suffering gender dysphoria in a less interventionist way, until he or she is an adult and can make a decision: “Consent is the issue here, nothing else.” He does not doubt that some patients will want, and need, to transition in the future. But, he says, not all children with gender dysphoria are trans. The two have been elided. More work needs to be done locally. “Gender dysphoria clinics should be part of child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and available nationwide,” he says. “At the moment, children who are suffering extreme distress in relation to their bodies are sent to the Tavistock and the problem then goes away at local level, where psychotherapy services are on their knees.”</p> <p>There is anger on both sides of the debate. But given his politics – Bell describes himself to me as a “Corbyn-supporting Jew” – he has been most shocked by the reluctance of the left to engage with the issues. “They think this is to do with being liberal, rather than with concerns about the care of children. Mermaids and Stonewall [the charities for trans children and LGBTQ+ rights] have made people afraid even of listening to another view.” It surprises him that the left is unwilling to consider the role played by big pharma. In the US, a journal that published a paper about the effect of puberty blockers on suicide risk recently had to disclose that one of its co-authors received a stipend from the manufacturer of another drug.</p> <p>When he appeared on <em>Channel 4 News</em> earlier this year, Bell was asked if he feared being on the wrong side of history. “I’ve often thought about that question,” he says. “It’s a good one. Psychiatry has a sad past. Homosexual men were given behavioural therapies and so on. But history isn’t always right. What matters is the truth. I hate the weaponisation of victimhood, the fact that the fear of being seen to be transphobic now overrides everything.” The current campaign to ban so-called gay conversion therapy is, he believes, likely to become a Trojan horse for trans activists who will use it to put pressure on any clinician who does not immediately affirm a young person’s statement about their identity, decrying this, too, as a form of “conversion”. For Bell, the prospect of not being able to talk openly about such things is a tyranny: just another form of repression. “This is about light and air,” he says. “It’s about free thinking, the kind that will result in better outcomes for all young people, whether transgender or not.”",False,pillar/news,News,['gender-based violence']

They are also aware of midwives and nurses refusing to care for patients before and after the procedure.</p> <p>As a result, women are ordering abortion pills online from European charities, travelling overseas during lockdown, or continuing with their unwanted pregnancy.</p> <p>Naomi Connor, co-convener for Alliance For Choice, a leading reproductive rights group, says services have regressed to the worst level in 50 years as women are allegedly being denied care.</p> <p>“We had a lady who went to her GP to get an abortion, and her GP refused to help her; she asked to see someone else in the practice, and the GP said ‘no one else will help you unless you’re keeping your pregnancy, and if you are, we’ll provide you with folic acid and pregnancy support, but otherwise, we won’t help you’.”</p> <p>Connor said: “We know that obstructing abortions doesn’t stop abortions, it just makes them unsafe.</p> <p>Dr Laura McLaughlin, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist from Doctors for Choice NI, said: “Some GPs have been very vocal about being obstructive towards either a service or any woman that comes to them for help [for an abortion].” </p> <p>“There are also nurses and midwives that don’t want to be on the floor or in the room when something like that [an abortion] is happening. ”</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Some GPs have been very vocal about being obstructive towards any woman who comes to them for help</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Laura McLaughlin, Doctors for Choice NI</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Abortion was legalised on 31 March after a decades-long campaign. Terminations can now be carried out up to 12 weeks on request, and up to 24 weeks if the mother’s mental or physical health is jeopardised. In cases of fatal foetal abnormality or impairment, no time restrictions apply.</p> <p>The Department for Health at Stormont has stated that it has received legal advice that, under the regulations, registered medical professionals in Northern Ireland may now terminate pregnancies lawfully on health and social care premises.</p> <p>Some doctors have publicly declared their opposition to abortion under any circumstance. Dr Andrew Cupples, a GP, <a href=""https://simplegp.net/2019/11/23/guidance-on-conscientious-objection-to-abortion-for-healthcare-workers-in-northern-ireland/"">stated in a blogpost</a> dated November 2019 that he would refuse to refer on a patient who wished to have an abortion, even in cases with a foetal abnormality: “Whenever a pregnant woman discovers that her child has downs, or a cleft palate, or tetralogy or spina bifida, and asks for an abortion, what do you do? Again, because there is no NI service, I believe that you are within your rights not to refer, even if there is a local obstetrician starting to take an interest in this work.”</p> <p>He also stated that he would encourage a pregnant woman who wished to have an abortion to have a scan, look at it and “talk them through what’s going on with the baby’s body at that point”, then he would book her in to an early pregnancy clinic.</p> <p>General Medical Council guidelines state that if doctors have a conscientious objection, patients must be told about their right to see another doctor, and arrangements should be made without delay so that the patient is treated.</p> <p>Cupples told the <em>Observer </em>this weekend that “doctors are under no obligation to go against their objections and refer a patient for that service”.",False,pillar/news,News,['forced abortion']

The film-makers set themselves very tough challenges. How do you, for example, illustrate a song getting stuck in somebody’s head? One of those wretched earworms that burrow deep into our brains?</p> <p>Moorhouse in particular (who directed the first three and the last two episodes) understands it’s less about a character hearing or singing the song than using cinematic language to materialise abstract ideas. This involves reverberating sound effects, changes in character behaviour, the establishing of a visual motif (tap-dancing shoes; you’ll have to watch it to find out why) – and even moments when the actors change realities by breaking into song.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""a8a3750739c6c52a2780e19b3d2d58cea69d9b00""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/a8a3750739c6c52a2780e19b3d2d58cea69d9b00/0_0_2150_1500/1000.jpg"" alt=""Linda (Mandy McElhinney, Omar (Richard Miller) and Nik (Rudi Dharmalingam) in Wakefield."" width=""1000"" height=""698"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Linda (Mandy McElhinney, Omar (Richard Miller) and Nik (Rudi Dharmalingam) in Wakefield.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: ABC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tune that gets stuck in the head of Nik (Rudi Dharmalingam), a psych nurse at Wakefield, is Dexys Midnight Runners’s Come On Eileen.

Because we never spend time with Ratched away from her workplace – and barely observe her alone in thought – we end up with a character who, while well acted, is ambiguous in many respects. We don’t understand what makes her tick or what motivates her, beyond a desire to maintain a sense of normality in the face of Randle McMurphy, Jack Nicholson’s trouble-making anti-establishmentarian.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""e82babc06e0f030e18273fadb6ab05250bc8d992""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/e82babc06e0f030e18273fadb6ab05250bc8d992/251_318_1850_1182/1000.jpg"" alt=""Kareena (Geraldine Hakewill) in Wakefield"" width=""1000"" height=""639"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">‘The psych ward unites them but does not define them’: Kareena (Geraldine Hakewill) in Wakefield.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: ABC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wakefield, on the other hand, is absolutely committed to exploring the inner and outer worlds of its characters. For much of the series Nik wears a blue T-shirt, blue being – as Patti Bellantoni reflected in her excellent book If It’s Purple, Someone’s Gonna Die – a quiet and aloof colour. A “colour to think to, but not to act”, which nevertheless has “an amazing ability to influence our emotional reactions”.</p> <p>The same could be said of Rudi Dharmalingam’s performance – he’s a terrific anchoring presence, with an ability to steer us into unpredictable directions – and indeed the uniformly outstanding cast around him.</p> <p>Gorgeous cinematography from Martin McGrath (who recently shot <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/01/operation-buffalo-review-maralinga-nuclear-testing-rendered-as-part-drama-part-farce"">Operation Buffalo</a> and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/24/ride-like-a-girl-review-cinematic-schmaltz-swamps-michelle-paynes-ride-to-the-melbourne-cup"">Ride Like A Girl</a>) is textured with a slightly foggy look, suggesting there is something unclear about this story. But Wakefield isn’t vague, lofty lyricism; the drama is tense and grounded, laced with illustrations of a sentiment stated in the marketing materials that “there’s a fine line between sanity and madness”.</p> <p>Early on, for instance, we see James (Dan Wyllie) in a suit and tie, discussing in a video call with clients how to “maximise an asset in a fluid and dynamic market”. Moorhouse then reveals where he is: in a communal area of the ward, wearing pyjama pants beneath a button-up shirt. He is a patient.</p> <p>Other moments play along similar lines, connecting to a bedrock idea from which the entire series extends: that we are all crazy – in our own ways and for our own reasons. The show’s perspective arises from a more learned era than the time of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, with an understanding that being “crazy” doesn’t mean acting “funny” – just as “sane” does not equal “serious” or “surly”.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""268e0f211cea6b3dcc7d267001d01728213ef79a""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/268e0f211cea6b3dcc7d267001d01728213ef79a/0_0_3543_2362/1000.jpg"" alt=""Nik (Rudi Dharmalingam) in new Australian ABC series Wakefield."" width=""1000"" height=""667"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">How do you illustrate a song getting stuck in somebody’s head?

But asking whether she is sane or not misses the point: we are all Nurse Ratched and we are all Randle McMurphy. While the old good angel/bad angel trope may be crude shorthand, it does have something going for it, in that all of us have good and bad – but good and bad are entirely none of us.</p> <p>Wakefield understands that, and a whole lot of other things besides. The word “nuanced” comes to mind, but does little to communicate drama so rich and involving. The ending (no spoilers) is so well done – such a powerful and moving look at trauma, so patiently revealed across the series’ eight hours – that the hairs on my body were literally standing up, and I came close to tears. A truly great achievement and one, as they say, for the ages.</p> <p><em>• Wakefield is available to binge in full now, on ABC iView.

There has been praise for aspects of the 43-year-old’s spell. His holistic approach and the big-game experience he had from his career as a player were perhaps his greatest strengths. His man-management was described as “world class” by his assistant Bev Priestman (who took charge of the Canada national team on 1 November last year) on the eve of England’s 2019 World Cup opener. She was backed by the right‑back Lucy Bronze, who said his relationship-building with players, fans and staff had helped England to “become a better team”.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/jan/18/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action"">Women\'s Super League: talking points from the weekend\'s action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Neville undoubtedly has an ability to build a rapport with players and to charm employers. He is, overall, not an unlikeable person. However, we will mainly remember the outbursts, the narrative twisting and an arrogance not befitting a man with such limited coaching credentials.</p> <p>“The performances over the last two games in my opinion have been outstanding,” he had said after a scrappy goal from Beth Mead salvaged a sluggish 1-0 defeat of Portugal – now ranked 30th in the world – in October 2019. “I’m pleased with the direction that we’re going.”</p> <p>It was a baffling assessment for anyone watching the game and would become a defining moment of his time in charge. Filled with a renewed confidence at having ended a five-game run without a win, Neville attacked a young journalist who had described the preceding performance in a 2-1 defeat against Brazil as “tepid”. He raged petulantly: “You wanted me sacked, didn’t you? Yes you did, I read it. I read it.”</p> <p>His record, say those searching for the positives, includes a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/06/japan-england-women-shebelieves-cup-match-report"" title="""">first SheBelieves Cup win</a>, a World Cup semi-final and Olympic qualification and Baroness Sue Campbell, the Football Association’s director of women’s football, said on Monday that his status as a former Manchester United and England player “did much to raise the profile of our team”.</p> <p>But how much did he actually improve the team, if at all? England were a good team when Neville took the reins in January 2018, third in the world and the top ranked European nation. They now sit sixth and have registered seven defeats and a draw in their past 11 games.</p> <p>Even the three wins left a lot to be desired. After the debacle in Portugal in October 2019 and a limp 2-1 defeat against Germany at Wembley in November, England twice fell behind to the Czech Republic (now ranked 27th in the world) and had to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/12/england-women-czech-republic-international-friendly-match-report"" title="""">rely on an 86th-minute goal from Leah Williamson to save face</a> – a goal which likely kept Neville in his job going into the new year.</p> <p>Against Japan, at the She Believes Cup the following March, an 83rd-minute goal from Ellen White ensured the somewhat humiliated Lionesses did not depart the mini‑tournament goalless.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""c47e69d5206d10f8436ac45f657b8c6cce2da425""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/c47e69d5206d10f8436ac45f657b8c6cce2da425/327_91_2279_1367/1000.jpg"" alt=""Phil Neville leaves England Women with their ranking lower than when he took charge in 2018."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Phil Neville leaves England Women with their ranking lower than when he took charge in 2018.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The jewel in Neville’s crown, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/02/england-fall-to-familiar-foe-as-steph-houghtons-penalty-ends-world-cup-dream"" title="""">the World Cup semi-final</a>, was the team’s third consecutive major semi-final, a hurdle he was charged with helping them to clear, but failed. In France, six goals from an in-form White helped to paper over the cracks of an at times chaotic defence and frequent lapses in concentration. In the end only a standout quarter-final defeat of Norway offered a complete England performance.</p> <p>Campbell is not wrong, Neville’s profile did bring attention. The biggest names in UK football journalism attended his unveiling at St George’s Park. But it would be wrong to suggest the Lionesses and women’s football owe a significant portion of an increased profile to the manager. Women’s football was (and is) growing and major tournaments bring eyes in increasing numbers. Neville’s decision to take on the job in the first place was not a charitable gesture on his part, a bid to use his profile to pull the women’s game into the spotlight, it was self-serving, a job that would bolster his managerial career and, if anything, the decision of a high‑profile player from the men’s game taking on the job was much more of a reflection of just how far the women’s game has come.</p> <p>Ignoring the results, the outgoing manager has been credited with changing the way the side play, making them a more possession‑dominating side that builds out from the back. Except it is likely that change would have taken place regardless. The top Women’s Super League sides were increasingly playing with the ball at their feet and building through the thirds and any appointment by the FA, which has been cultivating that style of play across all age groups, would have likely been encouraged to do similar.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jan/17/chelsea-manchester-united-wsl-match-report"">Fran Kirby hits winner as Chelsea beat Manchester United to go top of WSL</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the FA appointed Gareth Southgate on the men’s side the governing body took a risk, one that has, on the whole, paid off.

She also failed to tell parliament she had met one of Salmond’s former aides in her Holyrood office on 29 March 2018, when she is said to have been first told he was under investigation – another potential breach of the code.</p> <p> Several investigations were launched: Sturgeon referred herself under the ministerial code and the case was passed to James Hamilton, a former director of public prosecutions in Ireland; the Scottish parliament appointed a special committee to investigate the government’s handling of the inquiry and Sturgeon’s actions; and the government set up an internal review.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/feb/23/crown-office-says-it-has-grave-concerns-about-alex-salmond-evidence"">Holyrood redacts Alex Salmond evidence after Crown Office warning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Two weeks after winning his judicial review, Salmond appeared at Edinburgh sheriff court on 14 counts, including two of indecent assault, nine of sexual assault and two attempted rapes. He denied all the charges.</p> <p>In August 2019, the Scottish government paid Salmond £512,000 to cover his legal expenses for the judicial review. It later emerged that figure was so high because of serious procedural concerns about the government’s handling of his legal challenge.</p> <h2>What happened at the Salmond trial?</h2> <p>In March 2020, after nine days of evidence at the high court, Salmond was cleared of 14 charges – an attempted rape, one intent to rape, 11 sexual assaults and two indecent assaults, against 10 women. One charge was dropped by the crown; the jury acquitted Salmond of all the others on majority verdicts.</p> <p>Salmond <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/alex-salmond-tells-court-charges-are-fabrications-or-exaggerations"">admitted in evidence</a> he had an extramarital “sexual liaison” with one of the complainers, but on a different date to the one alleged in the charges, and a “sleepy cuddle” with another for which he soon apologised to her. It emerged during the trial a number of civil servants heard of two alleged incidents after the women involved told close colleagues.</p> <p>Once the trial ended, the Scottish parliament inquiry began to gather evidence.</p> <h2>What has happened with the two remaining inquiries?</h2> <p>The Holyrood inquiry has held 11 oral evidence sessions, given under oath, including several with Evans, the senior civil servants involved in drafting the sexual harassment policy used to investigate Salmond, and the officials who carried out the inquiry. MSPs heard that officials were aware of unspecified rumours about Salmond, including alleged bullying.</p> <p>The government has released thousands of pages of evidence but MSPs have repeatedly accused ministers of breaching promises to do so quickly. After ministers repeatedly refused to release their legal advice on the Salmond case, Holyrood voted twice to insist it was handed over. The government has not given way, and the committee has only been allowed to see a summary of the advice.</p> <h2>What happens now?</h2> <p>After weeks of legal wrangling over the publication of his submissions, Salmond has refused to appear before the Holyrood inquiry on Wednesday instead suggesting Friday, with Sturgeon expected to be its final witness next week.

Meanwhile, the Scottish government will have to publish Hamilton’s report into whether Sturgeon broke the ministerial code: many observers think that investigation is a greater threat to the first minister than the Holyrood inquiry.

In early 2018, he was accused by his senior managers of having committed fraud amounting to £56,000 by not seeing enough patients in each clinic.</p> <p>He said he was told that level of fraud was a imprisonable offence and was likely to result in him being struck off the medical register.</p> <p>He also alleged that he was told that this would result in a “terrible future for his family”; his children “would not have their father around and there would be no income to pay the family mortgage”. He was also told, he said, that this would “bring shame to his parents” – a statement he claimed was based on racist stereotypes.</p> <p>Chappiti said he was told by his managers that he needed to hold his extra clinics without payment for a year to “repay” the fraud. He alleged he was told to “keep [his] mouth shut” and not speak to anyone about the arrangement.</p> <p>Chappiti claimed the unpaid work amounted to modern slavery under the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the European convention on human rights.</p> <p>In August 2018, Chappiti said he met another senior manager, whom he told about the arrangement. The unpaid clinics were stopped the following week but a formal investigation into Chappiti was launched, which eventually decided he had no case to answer. </p> <p>Chappiti is now asking the tribunal for a declaration that he was forced to engage in modern slavery and for financial compensation.</p> <p>The experience has, said Chappiti, led to him being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression.</p> <p>Chappiti said the trust, where he has worked for 18 years, discriminated against him because of his race and subjected him to race-related harassment, creating an “intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating and offensive environment” for him.</p> <p>He also alleged the trust made unauthorised deductions from his wages and leaked details of the fraud allegation to the press.</p> <p>“I feel used, let down and ashamed of myself because I didn’t stand up to them,” he said. “It seems illogical that someone as experienced as me could be bullied but I think they targeted me precisely because I’m not an agitator: I just get on with treating my patients.”</p> <p>Richard Port, Chappiti’s lawyer from the legal firm Boardside, lodged a complaint at the tribunal in May. A date for the hearing has not yet been set.</p> <p>Port said: “This is an amazing case, featuring allegations of race discrimination, whistleblowing and even modern slavery (in the sense of forced labour) of a British Indian consultant ophthalmologist at a large NHS trust.</p> <p>“Modern slavery is a scourge, which raises its ugly head in surprising places and unexpected circumstances,” said Port, who has instructed barrister Sheryn Omeri, a specialist in discrimination law at Cloisters chambers in London, to fight the case.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust said: “We can confirm Dr Chappiti has brought a complaint in the employment tribunal. The trust denies the claims made and is defending the complaint.”",False,pillar/news,News,"['forced marriage', 'forced abortion']"

The afternoon sun in Canberra is warm and bright, the crowd is vocal and unforgiving, and Michelle Heyman is tearing away from her towards goal.</p> <p>Polkinghorne flashes a desperate look towards the sideline official, whose flag has stayed down. The offside trap that she and her Brisbane Roar teammates had set to keep Heyman contained has been breached. The Roar captain watches forlornly as the Canberra United striker shoulders off her challenger, takes a touch and slots the ball low and hard across the goalkeeper.</p> <p>Another goal and an assist followed that day for Heyman, as she helped Canberra win the 2011-12 W-League grand final against Brisbane. The game would book-end the most impressive season to date for the iconic forward and the club she became the face of: Heyman would win the Golden Boot while Canberra would become the first club to go through a W-League season undefeated.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/mar/07/its-a-constant-fight-four-top-players-discuss-the-future-of-womens-football"">\'It’s a constant fight\': Four top players discuss the future of women\'s football</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Polkinghorne knew the feeling, though. She was there when Queensland Roar won the double in the league’s inaugural season, defeating Canberra in the championship final. She was there when the Matildas became the first Australian team to win the Asian Cup in 2010. And she was there to become the first defender to win the Julie Dolan medal twice – once in 2013 and again in 2018. </p> <p>Not much has changed in the almost 10 years since Polkinghorne threw up a hopeless, pale arm as Heyman strode away from her that afternoon in 2012. This past Sunday, the Roar captain watched on as her decade-long W-League rival and Matildas teammate did it again, muscling her opponent off the ball and sliding it past the goalkeeper. That moment – the run, the touch, the finish – was a kind of historical echo, containing within it all the resistance and persistence of not just the two iconic women of Heyman and Polkinghorne themselves, but also the league and the teams they have become synonymous with.</p> <p>Now in their early 30s, both players celebrated characteristic milestones in the same game at the weekend: Heyman equalled the W-League’s all-time goal scoring record (70, along with Sam Kerr), while Polkinghorne became the first player in league history to tally 150 appearances for the same club (Heyman, for her part, currently sits at 98 appearances for Canberra).</p> <p>These numbers are all the more impressive when you consider the footballing context within which both have worked for the past decade. Up until the W-League’s collective bargaining agreement in 2017, players in Australia’s top women’s league (including Matildas) did not have guaranteed salaries, nor did they have minimum medical or travel standards.

The conviction is less a signal that the criminal justice system can work for victims than a signal that women’s grassroots organising can accomplish things that would never have otherwise been possible. The symbolic significance of his conviction can’t be overstated: for women, this is a very good day.</p> <p><strong>Jill Filipovic in the Guardian<br></strong>Women’s rights advocates should take wins where we can get them. But history isn’t a straight line, and this verdict does not unquestionably propel us into a fairer world for sexual assault survivors. The criminal justice system will remain an imperfect venue for most cases.</p> <p>What would feel like real justice for sexual assault survivors? That is the next big question for #MeToo. There is no perfect solution here. But at the very least, Weinstein’s conviction despite one of the ugliest, most misogynistic defences in recent memory suggests we’re ready to start figuring it out.</p> <p><strong>Gerard Baker in the Times<br></strong>Weinstein’s lechery, bullying and entitlement was an open secret in Hollywood for decades. Yet there has been no real attempt to hold accountable those many people, in Hollywood and beyond, who aided or enabled the mogul’s deviancy, or simply looked the other way because it was inconvenient to do otherwise.</p> <p>None of these, of course, is as culpable as the producer himself and perhaps few of us would have had the guts to challenge him.

People move there or stay there because they fall in love with the gothic revival Victorian houses, which exist in various states of renovation or decay. One of those people was photographer <a href=""https://carolyndrake.com/"">Carolyn Drake</a>, who settled in Water Valley a few years ago, having returned from a decade of travelling in Russia and Asia, including a spell living and photographing in Uighur villages on the edge of the Taklamakan desert.</p> <p>Drake spent two years in Water Valley hardly picking up her camera. She wasn’t sure how to photograph the place without it looking like a New Yorker’s view of “the south”. It was only after she became part of a knitting circle, an insider, sitting on her friend Katharine’s porch drinking IPA, stitching rugs, listening to true crime podcasts, that she found a way to do that. <em>Knit Club</em>, her strange and powerful book of photographs of the women of Water Valley, is the result.</p> <p>This picture, in which her fellow knitters and quilters are obscured by flowers, captures one of the themes of her book, an extreme playfulness with ideas of motherhood and femininity – ideas she had tended “to run away from with her camera”. In the collaborative community of the knit club she began to question why she resisted those ideas. Some of her photographs are taken in abandoned houses, some in dusky woodland; several suggest mysterious sisterly ritual. In most, Drake has suggested, the women’s faces are obscured to avoid replicating the male gaze. There are no captions, but brief fragments of quotation in the book, from the knitters. Katharine, for example, says: “I live right in the middle of town, so everybody sees us sitting out here. A couple of my friends’ ex-husbands, they just hate it. They’re like: ‘These chicks are up to no good.’ Maybe they’re right.”</p> <p><em><a href=""https://tbwbooks.com/products/knit-club"">Knit Club is published by TBW Books</a></em",False,pillar/news,News,['women killed over honor']

So is an increase in the number of homicides in which the victim was under 16, to its highest level since 2004. Caution must always be taken in forming conclusions based on a single year’s figures. The human tragedies behind such data are shaped by a multitude of factors. But it is impossible not to be disappointed that violence against women and children increased during a period when the government was led by a prime minister, Theresa May, who counted domestic abuse among her <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/17/theresa-may-domestic-violence-abuse-act-laws-consultation"" title="""">personal priorities</a>.</p> <p>Almost half of the 241 killings of women and girls were domestic, with 38% involving a partner or ex-partner, while 31% of the 68 victims aged under 16 (including boys, and 30 babies aged less than one) were killed by a parent or step-parent. This figure is set to rise, as a perpetrator has yet to be confirmed in 53% of child homicides – and killings of children by strangers are very rare.</p> <p>It is too soon to assert conclusively that the trend in killings of women and children is upwards. Until 2017, the number of female victims of homicide had fallen in most years since the early 2000s (when a spike included the 130 female victims of Harold Shipman). But the rise in homicides of women and children, who are mainly killed by partners or close family members (in contrast to men, who are more often killed by friends or strangers), means that home life for women, girls and boys has become less safe.</p> <p>After several years of sharp rises, last year’s 11% fall in the number of male victims is hugely welcome – as is a 24% fall in the number of those aged 16-24. These figures contributed to an <a href=""https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019"" title="""">overall 5% decline</a> in the homicide rate. But while it is neither possible nor helpful to point to a single reason either for this development or for the rise in killings of women and children, it is essential to put both into context. By promising to increase police numbers by 20,000, ministers have in effect acknowledged a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/08/police-cuts-likely-contributed-to-rise-in-violent-leaked-report-reveals"" title="""">link between police cuts and rising crime</a>. Mrs May’s domestic abuse bill, which would have strengthened protection for some victims, fell when December’s general election was called. Budgets for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/23/council-funding-womens-refuges-cut-since-2010-england-wales-scotland"" title="""">refuge and crisis services</a> have been stretched beyond breaking point.</p> <p>Meanwhile, an increasingly chaotic situation in the wider criminal justice system has led to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/14/probation-sector-in-crisis-report-finds"" title="""">well-documented failures</a>, with the position with regard to rape prosecutions especially dire.

The deadline triggered a collapse in prices as desperate oil traders with more crude than storage space were forced to take action.</p> \n<p>Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer-winning oil historian, said: “The May crude oil contract is going out not with a whimper, but a primal scream.”</p> \n<p>The price of oil from the US shale heartlands has been declining steadily in recent weeks following <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/15/oil-prices-slump-as-market-faces-lowest-demand-in-25-years-covid-19"">the biggest slump in oil demand for 25 years</a> steps due to restrictions on travel to curb the spread of Covid-19. The fall accelerated amid rising fears that the global economy may be facing its deepest downturn since the Great Depression.</p> \n<p>Oil producers have continued to pump near-record levels of crude into the global market even as analysts warned that the impact of the coronavirus outbreak would drive oil demand to its lowest levels since 1995. The emergence of negative oil prices is expected to prompt some oil companies to hasten the shutdown of their rigs and oil wells to avoid plunging deeper into debt or bankruptcy.</p> \n<p>The collapse will come as a blow to US President Donald Trump who took credit for brokering a historic deal between the Opec oil cartel and the world’s largest oil producing nations to limit the flood of oil production into the market. The pact to cut between 10 million and 20 million barrels of oil from the market from next month was dismissed by many within the market as “too little, too late” to avoid a market crash.</p> \n<p>At his daily White House briefing, Trump described the negative price as a “short-term problem”. He said the US was filling up its strategic reserves: “If we could buy it for nothing, we’re gonna take everything we can get,” he said.</p> \n<figure class=""element element-atom""> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=""8d3b7c2a-3328-472b-bf78-e277fe57ac8a"" data-atom-type=""media""> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DbP_LVSZl2g?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0""></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-20T19:18:52/embed.html"" data-alt=""Graph: US oil prices since 1983""> \n <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-20T19:18:52/embed.html"">Graph: US oil prices since 1983</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The Guardian reported over the weekend that a record 160m barrels of oil was being <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/19/supertankers-drafted-in-to-store-glut-of-crude-oil-coronavirus"">stored in “supergiant” oil tankers outside the world’s largest shipping ports</a>, including in the US Gulf. The last time floating storage reached levels close to this was in the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, when traders stored more than 100m barrels at sea before offloading stocks when the economy began to recover.</p> \n<p>Historically weak oil markets are likely to bring lower prices for drivers at service station forecourts, but the price collapse will also hurt pension savings which are often invested in major oil companies through funds which track equity markets. The oil price crisis has already wiped billions from the market value of the largest oil companies, many of which will not be able to pay dividends if the market rout drags on.</p> \n<p>Brett Fleishman, from climate campaign group at 350.org, said the collapse of oil prices is “another powerful example of how fossil fuels are too volatile to be the basis of a resilient economy”.</p> \n<p>“We are experiencing an unparalleled upending in our economies. And it is time for the fossil fuel industry to recognize that, from now on, the cheapest and best place to store oil is in the ground,” he said.</p> \n<p>“While this recession shows us that we desperately need sustainable, resilient, and stable economic systems, based on renewable, accessible and just energy sources, the fossil fuel industry is not only trying to profit off of the current chaos, but continues to drive us further into climate breakdown,” Fleishman added.</p> \n<p>Oil prices began to rise again on Tuesday as oil traders turn their attention to trading oil for delivery in June.</p> \n<p>The US oil market - known in the industry as the West Texas Intermediate price - is expected to trade above $20 a barrel this week, recovering from its slump into negative territory. The international oil price benchmark, known as Brent crude, is trading at around $26 a barrel.</p> \n<p>The recovery is expected to pick up over the second half of the year as tight restrictions on travel to help curb the spread of the virus are lifted, raising demand for fuels and oil. At the same time supply is expected to dwindle due to the historic deal to limit oil production and the financial collapse of weaker oil companies.</p> \n<p>However, most analysts believe that oil prices <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/13/historic-oil-production-cuts-slump-demand-goldman-sachs-coronavirus"">will fail to reach the same price levels</a> recorded at the beginning of the year before the outbreak.

The House speaker once scoffed that a “<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/20/nancy-pelosi-openly-critical-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ilhan-omar"">glass of water</a>” could have won congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s seat; she <a href=""https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/07/pelosi-trump-government-shutdown-1154355"">condescendingly</a> described the Green New Deal as the “green dream, or whatever they call it”; she dismissed the ever-growing Squad as “<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/14/politics/pelosi-aoc-60-minutes/index.html"">like, five people</a>”. Now some imaginative new insults have come out. Pelosi once mocked the Squad’s “purity politics” using a baby voice, according to a new book by Susan Page, Madam Speaker: Nancy Pelosi and the Lessons of Power.</p> <p>“Some people come [to Congress] … to pose for holy pictures,” <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/pelosi-mocked-aoc-squad-as-perfect-and-pure-baby-voice-2021-4"">Pelosi told Page</a> while discussing the Squad in a 2019 interview. Page writes that Pelosi then: “changed her voice and mimicked a child trying to make a solemn show of piety. ‘See how perfect I am and how pure?’”</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/10/fertility-cliff-age-35-week-in-patriarchy"">It is time to reassess our obsession with women’s fertility and the number 35 | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“When you come in, cross that door, take that oath, you have to be oriented toward results,” Pelosi continued, apparently referring to AOC. “Have confidence in what you believe in, have humility to listen to somebody else, because you’re not a one-person show.”</p> <p>It’s a little bizarre to describe Ocasio-Cortez as a “one-person show” when she’s part of something that’s called the Squad. While AOC gets a huge amount of media coverage, she doesn’t hog the mic, she shares it. During her short political career, she, along with the other members of the Squad, have worked incredibly hard to amplify the sorts of voices that don’t usually get heard. Instead of pulling up the ladder behind them, they’ve worked to dismantle the barriers that stop regular people from entering politics. In 2019, for example, the Squad <a href=""https://www.vox.com/2019/4/3/18290851/ocasio-cortez-dccc-blacklist-incumbent-democrats-vendors"">spoke out against</a> the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s (DCCC) policy of prioritizing incumbent Democrats. This has always been an unofficial policy but, in 2019, the DCCC announced they would blacklist any political vendors that worked with challengers in Democratic primaries. That’s a big deal because it helps enshrine the status quo. It helps to keep the same sort of people in power.</p> <p>“If the DCCC enacts this policy … we risk undermining an entire universe of potential candidates and vendors – especially women and people of color – whose ideas, energy, and innovation need a place in our party,” Ayanna Pressley <a href=""https://twitter.com/AyannaPressley/status/1112050765793845248?s=20"">tweeted at the time</a>. She explained that she wouldn’t be airing all this on Twitter if people in the DCCC had listened to the Squad’s concerns. “When a candidate takes the risk to run, Democrats should not be in the practice of creating litmus tests or roadblocks that have a chilling effect on new candidates.”</p> <p>As well as speaking out against the blacklist policy – which the <a href=""https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/03/the-dccc-blacklist-is-no-more.html"">DCCC eventually dropped</a> – the Squad launched a fundraising committee to <a href=""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kadiagoba/squad-fundraising-progressive-candidates-aoc-omar-tlaib"">raise money for progressive candidates</a>. How on earth does this constitute a “one-person show”?</p> <p>Pelosi may wax lyrical about the importance of listening to others, but it’s worth noting that the US government is still very much a one-type-of-person show. The majority of lawmakers in Congress <a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/04/majority-of-lawmakers-millionaires/"">are millionaires</a>, for example. Far too many are also related to each other or former politicians. One study found that <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/opinion/sunday/seth-stephens-davidowitz-just-how-nepotistic-are-we.html"">sons of senators</a> have an 8,500 times higher chance of becoming a senator than an average American male. I don’t want to diminish Pelosi’s achievements at all, but she herself is part of a political dynasty: her dad was a congressman and a three-term mayor of Baltimore. The government may be full of people who call themselves <em>representatives – </em>but they mostly represent an elite sliver of the United States. If we want government to work for the people then it’s imperative that we don’t have the 1% legislating for the 99%. It’s easy to dismiss social justice as “purity politics” when, like Pelosi, you have a net worth of $114m. </p> <p>However, things like a living wage and student debt forgiveness aren’t purity politics when they’re a part of your daily life – they’re existential. AOC, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib are still <a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/04/members-of-congress-owe-millions-in-student-loans/"">paying back student loans</a>; Cori Bush has experienced <a href=""https://www.stlmag.com/news/politics/cori-bush/"">homelessness</a>. We need more politicians like this. We need more politicians who understand how the system has failed people; not more politicians who have always benefited from the system.</p> <p>Pelosi has had an impressive career, but publicly demeaning the Squad really isn’t a good look. True leadership isn’t just about knowing how to leverage the power you have, it’s about knowing when to step back and cede power to a new generation.</p> <h2><strong>Australian </strong><strong>navy battles twerking scandal</strong></h2> <p>Eyebrows were raised and pearls were clutched this week over an “inappropriate” twerking performance by a dance troupe to launch a new <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/apr/14/twerking-among-top-brass-the-inappropriate-dance-routine-the-australian-navy-tried-to-hide"">naval vessel</a>.

Earlier this month, she warned that domestic abuse killings were up to twice as high as normal since lockdown measures confined millions of people to their homes, although the sample size was small.</p> \n<p>“There was always going to be an epidemic [of domestic violence] inside this pandemic,” Baird said. “It should have been flagged up a lot earlier. There have been stories from social services of people not being able to obtain admission to [family] homes [to investigate] because they have been told, inappropriately, they haven’t got personal protective equipment (PPE).</p> \n<p>“Ministers are working very hard but they are all working in their own silos. It’s imperative that there be more accommodation made available for victims of domestic violence. Refuges are full, others are in lockdown because of coronavirus [so can’t take in new victims].”</p> \n<p>There were 72 refuge vacancies in England on 3 April, compared to 170 on the same day last year. The Women’s Aid Annual Survey 2017, carried out on a single day, found there were 3,557 women with 3,919 children and young people staying in refuges across all services in England.</p> \n<figure class=""element element-atom""> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=""interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default"" data-atom-type=""interactive""> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>“There’s very little accommodation,” Baird said. “Universities and hotels have been offering help” but they cannot provide the specialist services required, she added.</p> \n<p>An intergovernmental group involving both the Ministry of Justice and Home Office should be established to deal with the problem, Baird urged, with the victims’ commissioner and domestic abuse commissioner also involved.</p> \n<p>A survey published by Women’s Aid on Tuesday found that over two-thirds of survivors contacted this month said that domestic abuse was escalating under lockdown; 72% said their abuser has more control over their life since Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Over three-quarters (78%) of victims, the survey found, reported that Covid-19 has made it harder for them to leave their abuser. One survivor said: “I wanted to leave the relationship. However, since Covid-19 and the lockdown coming into effect, it has made it harder to leave. I am a key worker who is around Covid positive patients, so I don’t feel like I can go home and stay with my parents.”</p> \n<p>Womens’ Aid said there was a severe shortage of refuge places even before the pandemic. There were about 300 refuges in England and Wales in 2017 but funding has been cut.</p> \n<p>Lucy Hadley, campaigns and policy manager at Women’s Aid, said: “Demand for refuge services far outstripped supply before the Covid-19 crisis. Sixty-four per cent of refuge referrals were declined in 2018-19, and the number of refuge bed spaces in England is 30% below the number recommended by the Council of Europe. These life-saving services are now on the frontline of the response to the pandemic.</p> \n<p>“They are now facing staff shortages, lost income, challenges in managing social distancing within communal accommodation, and restrictions on resettling women and children into long-term housing. This simply means the spaces we have are even less accessible to survivors.”</p> \n<p>Baird also told the justice committee that there is “some suggestion of abuse by older children on parents” during the coronavirus lockdown. “This is a newer kind of domestic abuse which is probably suggestive of kids wanting to go out and not being allowed to. We are talking teenagers.”</p> \n<p>Calls to domestic violence helplines have rocketed, she said, although complaints to the police have not gone up commensurately. “There are real worries about access to any help if you are locked down with the perpetrator in the next room.”</p> \n<p>Labour’s shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds MP, has criticised the government’s announcement that it is providing just over £3m in emergency aid. “That is why Labour has set out an urgent £75m plan to fund charities working to protect people suffering from domestic abuse,” he said.</p> \n<figure class=""element element-embed"" data-alt=""Callout callout-coronavirus""> \n <iframe class=""fenced"" srcdoc=""<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>""></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>In the Commons, the new attorney general, Suella Braverman, said the extra funds being made available would help frontline services.

He was about to play Glastonbury, a turn of events by which he seemed utterly perplexed. He suggested the audience might know his music because their parents had played it when they were kids, “which,” he chuckled, “probably counts as child abuse”.</p> <p>But by then he’d got used to unlikely things happening in his career. There was the gig he played at the Bonnaroo festival in the US the previous year. At an event that had also featured Radiohead, Skrillex, Bon Iver and Kendrick Lamar, Rogers had received some of the best reviews; one critic felt moved to call Rogers’ appearance “the performance of a lifetime”.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2020/mar/21/kenny-rogers-a-life-in-pictures"">Kenny Rogers - a life in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then there was his popularity in Jamaica. Look on YouTube and you can find shaky cameraphone footage of Kingston truck drivers killing time between deliveries by singing Rogers’ 1979 hit The Coward of the County. The first time he played there, he recalled, it took him four hours to get into the venue, such were the crowds outside. “They knew every word of my songs,” he said. “I think they were all stoned.”</p> <p>But, for all his bemusement, Rogers seemed seemed to take each unlikely turn in his stride. “Somebody asks me to play, then here I come,” he reasoned. “Nothing stops me.” Maybe he had learned this early on.</p> <p>Rogers was raised on country music by his mother, a Hank Williams fan, but before his solo career took off, he had variously dabbled in doo-wop; played bass in a jazz trio, the Bobby Doyle Three; done a stretch in the New Christy Minstrels, one of a number of large ensemble folk bands who acted as a kind of finishing school for 60s US rock stars and through whose ranks the Byrds’ Gene Clark, Barry “Eve Of Destruction” McGuire and record producer Jerry Yester also passed; and found success with the First Edition.</p> <p>This last band couldn’t seem to decide whether they were explorers of psychedelic inner space – their 1967 single Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In) was a favourite of Jimi Hendrix – a country-rock band, a middle-of-the-road bubblegum outfit, a gospel-inspired pop act, or purveyors of funky, Dr John-influenced swamp rock, as suggested by their 1973 medley The Hoodooin’ of Miss Fannie DeBerry/The Ritual. The charitable interpretation was that the First Edition were admirably eclectic, declining to be hemmed in by one genre in the confused, post-Beatles climate of US pop. A more prosaic explanation would be that the First Edition would do pretty much anything they thought might get them a hit.</p> <p>For a while, it was an approach that worked admirably: they scored a string of international hits and even had their own TV show, Rollin’ On the River. But their career began to wane dramatically. By 1974, Rogers was broke and reduced to promoting guitar lesson albums in a TV commercial; when United Artists signed him as a solo artist in 1975, it was widely thought they were taking a risk on someone whose moment had passed. But the First Edition’s oeuvre contained the seeds of Rogers’ solo success. Ruby Don’t Take Your Love To Town, from 1969, and its follow-up Reuben James were middle-of-the-road country tracks whose musical softness concealed a tough lyrical centre: the first was the story of a paralysed Vietnam veteran imploring his wife not to cuckold him, the second gradually revealed itself to be about an impoverished African-American who’d taken it upon himself to raise a white prostitute’s son after her death.</p> <p>They were the kind of songs Rogers would turn to over and over again. Behind the Nashville gloss, his first solo hit, Lucille, offered a stark portrayal of a man picking up a woman in a bar, and attempting to forget the sight of her bankrupt husband tearfully pleading with her to return; his signature song, The Gambler, offered the gloomy prediction that “the best you can hope for is to die in your sleep”. The Coward of the County was grimmer still: the song centres around a gang rape. Rogers’ other stock-in-trade was ballads that played on his silver-fox good looks, including a string of duets with the singer Dottie West, brought to an end when she died in a car crash in 1981. They were songs, as he put it, “that say what every man would like to say and every woman would like to hear”.</p> <p>Together, they made Rogers a star – loosely conceptual, his 1978 The Gambler went platinum five times in the US alone and was subsequently turned into a movie. The success was helped by the fact that Rogers was a charming live performer with a line in very funny between-song patter and by his well-judged and broad-minded choice in material and collaborators that stretched far beyond the usual Nashville songwriters’ pool.</p> <p>He covered Bob Seger’s We’ve Got Tonight and Billy Preston’s You Are So Beautiful; his hit Lady was one of a number of songs he recorded written by Lionel Richie; and before Bette Davis Eyes made her an adult-oriented rock solo star, he got his fellow former New Christy Minstrel Kim Carnes to co-write an entire album for him, another loosely conceptual work called Gideon. And he was smart enough to avail himself of the services of the Bee Gees when the Gibb brothers switched from performing to writing and producing. The result was 1983’s Eyes That See In the Dark, a brilliant pop album that occasionally hinted at country – as on the track Buried Treasure – but more importantly spawned his peerless collaboration with Dolly Parton, Islands In the Stream, a 2m-selling single that was subsequently voted the greatest country duet of all time by America’s Country Music Television.</p> <p>In truth, Rogers never came up with an album as good as that again. He subsequently sank into making unmemorable soft rock – umpteen Christmas albums, covers of Labi Siffre’s Something Inside So Strong and Dolly Parton’s I Will Always Love You, an album of religious songs that you could only buy alongside your chicken and dumplings at Cracker Barrel restaurants – with only occasional sparks of inspiration. If it wasn’t up to the standards of his 70s work, 2006’s Water and Bridges was at least interesting, a set of songs about memory and loss that seemed to play on the fact that his voice was ageing.</p> <p>He didn’t sell records in anything like the quantity he once had, but he remained a huge live draw, always happy to sing the songs audiences wanted to hear: “I’m contractually obliged to sing The Gambler and Islands In the Stream,” he said. “I love it. To come on stage and know I’ve got The Gambler at the end of the show – that’s a weapon.”</p> <p>They were weapons that invariably worked. For all his doubts about Glastonbury – “I know the acts that play [there],” he mused, “and that just doesn’t sound like me” – he was rapturously received: the response to Islands In the Stream from the Sunday afternoon crowd was such that he was forced to sing it twice. From a vantage point in the crowd, it didn’t look like Kenny Rogers minded doing that one bit.",False,pillar/arts,Arts,['gang-rape']

Not far from Bokerley Ditch was a huge bank – a rifle range made for training first world war Tommies and later pressed into service again for the fight against Hitler. It’s now nibbled by sheep which, I presume, occasionally spit out a bullet.</p> <p>Roland and I made our way south, the ghostlines of the Cursus sunk in the land to our right, and on to a narrow path by a long, thin patch of woodland to our left, its low boughs occasionally making us duck and weave.

We folded our maps, pulled out waterproofs, munched squashed sandwiches and retreated a little more under the tree cover, where only occasional drips found the space between necks and clothing.</p> <p>Roland pointed out that recent forestry work had removed the conifers, leaving native trees and revealing some modest lumps and bumps which might have been barrows or part of the ancient Grim’s Ditch complex, elsewhere rubbed out by the plough.</p> <p>But I was still talking about the Apollo missions, specifically the photographs taken on the moon. These were some of the most recognisable images of the 20th century: from the prints left by astronauts’ feet on the lunar surface to the huge, beautiful desolation of the landing zone and, of course, “Earthrise” – the moment of the fragile Earth’s milky elevation above the dust-scape, a turning point in the way human beings see ourselves, maybe.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/jan/11/semi-solo-hiking-brings-me-the-gift-of-time-alone-and-the-joy-of-reuniting"">Semi-solo hiking brings me the gift of time alone, and the joy of reuniting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the rain slackened we pushed our bikes along the muddy path that led through the narrow stand of trees, emerging into light. Opening before us was a large field of a pale-green crop – which we later identified as unripe oats – cut through with a neat, straight path leading to more woodland; trees also fringed the field to our north. To the south the land rose to the horizon, meeting a greasy napkin sky.</p> <p>Some places have <em>something. </em>In 2006 the CPRE (formerly known as the Campaign to Protect Rural England) commissioned a Tranquillity Survey, attempting to pin down sites that had a sense of peace, calm or isolation, and map England’s quiet spots, county by county.

<p>The parents of Hannah Clarke, who was murdered along with her three children in Queensland earlier this year, <a

would prevent behaviour that is not physically violent, but can indicate that an offender is seeking to control a partner or former partner.</p> <p>The behaviours can include isolation, deprivation and monitoring and controlling appearance, finances, or access to children, and are seen as a key indicator that a person may be progressing towards a physically violent attack.</p> <p>Rowan Baxter murdered his estranged wife, Clarke, and his three children after exhibiting 17 different types of controlling behaviour in the years leading up to the attack, Clarke’s parents Lloyd and Sue say.</p>

could have saved Hannah and her three children\'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Starting in Queensland, the Clarkes want to increase education around these behaviours, and hope laws will be introduced that will criminalise them.</p> <p>This would mean police could arrest and charge an offender for behaviour which, in most states and territories, is currently not a crime.</p> <p>“I’m sure it would have saved her,” Sue Clarke told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>Family violence victims and the support sector agree that these behaviours are deeply damaging and misunderstood.</p> <p>But <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/06/coercive-control-is-a-form-of-intimate-terrorism-and-must-be-criminalised"">fissures are emerging</a> about how best to deal with them.</p> <p>Lynda Memery, the manager of policy and campaigns at the Women’s Legal Service Victoria, said that coercive control should be included in the civil jurisdiction of all states and territories, meaning it could be relied upon when it came to victims seeking court orders protecting them from their abusers.</p> <p>But she said there was little evidence that showed the introduction of coercive control offences in Tasmania, Scotland, Ireland and the UK had made women safer.</p> <p>“In pretty much every state and territory, they are exploring this, as they should be as they have a responsibility to look and see if there’s something else we should be doing,” Memery said.</p> <p>“On the surface it looks appealing, but then digging a little bit further … it’s not the right pathway to go down.</p> <p>“It’s a complex social problem, family violence isn’t something that can be fixed by any one law.”</p> <p>Two women who said they had experienced relationships with elements of coercive control also told Guardian Australia they did not feel the creation of a new criminal law would have protected them.</p> <p>The women, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was clear there needed to be greater community awareness of what constituted coercive control, but said entrusting police to investigate and charge the men responsible was not the solution.</p> <p>One victim, who is also a lawyer, said unfortunately women including those from Indigneous or marginalised backgrounds could not trust they would be treated equally in the criminal justice system.</p> <p>“I care very deeply about what happens to women, but it’s clear that ... there are so many women in our society who don’t receive the treatment from police and the courts that they should.”</p> <p>Antoinette Braybrook, the chair of the national family violence prevention and legal services forum, said any state seeking to criminalise coercive control needed to first ensure they spoke to the women who were affected and the organisations that supported them.</p> <p>The forum comprises 13 legal services for Indigenous people experiencing or at risk of family violence.</p> <p>“There must be proper consultation with our communities and our … legal services who are the experts on the ground every day supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, particularly women and their children.”</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

This oppressive decision is part of a slide towards authoritarianism that began in earnest after the rightwing populist Law and Justice party (PiS) of Jarosław Kaczyński won an absolute majority in 2015. It must not be allowed to continue.</p> \n<p>Halting this deterioration is, first, a matter for the people of Poland. Although this predominantly Catholic, socially conservative country already has some of the strictest abortion prohibitions in Europe, surveys suggest that only a small minority supports additional curbs. Not for the first time, Kaczyński and PiS are deliberately ignoring the democratic consensus to advance a narrow ideological and religious agenda.</p> \n<p>Pro-choice supporters have reacted quickly. Angry crowds besieged streets around Kaczyński’s home in Warsaw waving signs that read “You are building women’s hell”. More demonstrations are planned this weekend in a nationwide upsurge of protest reminiscent of 2016, when tens of thousands of women dressed in black <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/30/how-polands-far-right-government-is-pushing-abortion-underground"">marched against earlier anti-abortion legislation</a>.</p> \n<figure class=""element element-atom""> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=""2f5d9254-89b3-4b8a-a372-d5e7f6a23195"" data-atom-type=""media""> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KOOsDaPHV28?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0""></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The new restrictions ban terminations in the case of severe foetal impairment, currently the reason given for most legal abortions. In future, abortion in Poland will be allowed only in cases of rape, incest or where there is a threat to the mother’s life. Such cases account for only 2% of legal terminations. Each year, thousands of Polish women seeking abortions are forced to travel abroad.</p> \n<p>The ruling is a direct assault on women’s rights and a moral obscenity. It is also legally flawed, in the sense that the PiS packed the tribunal with loyalists who delivered the result it wanted. Sadly, this is not unusual in Poland, whose government is locked in a long-running <a href=""https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20200712IPR83209/rule-of-law-in-poland-meps-point-to-overwhelming-evidence-of-breaches"">dispute with the EU commission</a> over its repeated attacks on judicial independence, free media and LGBT rights.</p> \n<p>Past attempts by Brussels to impose penalties have been ineffective, owing to a lack of solidarity and, more recently, to Polish threats to block the new EU budget and pandemic recovery fund.

It is always about the person who is at the centre of this.”</p> <p>The issue dominated parliament last week, culminating in Higgins’ <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/feb/19/brittany-higgins-proceeds-with-formal-complaint-about-alleged"">announcement on Friday</a> that she was re-engaging with the Australian federal police and would proceed with a formal complaint about her alleged rape in Parliament House.</p> <p>Higgins has also called for a “truly independent investigation” and widespread reform to the way staffers are treated.</p> <p>Morrison has maintained that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/feb/20/brittany-higgins-shocking-story-must-be-a-turning-point-women-in-politics-have-had-enough"">his office was first made aware</a> of the alleged rape of Higgins on 12 February this year, the day the media inquiry was submitted.</p> <p>But on Tuesday, Morrison <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/feb/16/scott-morrison-publicly-rebukes-defence-minister-for-not-reporting-allegation-to-him"">publicly rebuked Reynolds</a>, now the defence minister, for failing to tell him about the matter at the time.

I’m not saying in every case, but a pervasive culture of discourtesy, of disrespect, of getting somebody as opposed to getting something done,” Westacott said, while also raising concerns about bullying.</p> <p>“That culture is a cancer that gives rise to these very serious events that happen in this place. Frankly, it wouldn’t be tolerated in a good workplace and shouldn’t be. But this is not just about this place. We’ve got to get on top of the disrespect that people have for women and that starts with how young people are educated.”</p> <p>When asked about those comments on Sunday, Morrison said the culture needed to change “but I’ve got to say, if any workplace thinks that this is just confined to the parliament, they’re kidding themselves – seriously, they’re kidding themselves”.</p> <p>“We’ve got our issues to deal with as a parliament, and we’re saying we do,” Morrison said.</p> <p>“All I’m simply saying is we need to deal with what’s happening in our house and everybody needs to deal with what is happening in theirs.”</p> <p>Morrison said he hoped the reviews he had ordered over the past week would lead to an improvement of the culture at Parliament House, and “provide greater support to anyone who would find themselves a victim of those types of events in the future”.</p> <p>“It is a fairly straightforward expectation: I want the culture to be better; I want the system to be better.”</p> <p>Morrison said the finance minister, Simon Birmingham, was working with other party leaders on a multiparty parliamentary process “and we hope to make further announcements there”.</p> <p>Morrison <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/feb/20/scott-morrison-upset-after-reports-second-woman-assaulted-by-man-who-allegedly-raped-brittany-higgins"">said on Saturday</a> he was “very upset” at reports a second woman was sexually assaulted by the same man who allegedly raped Higgins.</p> <p>The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said on Saturday he was “shocked” by the new allegations.

For the second time in just over a year, nine House impeachment managers carried the charge in a ceremonial procession across the US Capitol, recently invaded with fatal consequences by a violent mob urged on by Trump. Senate leaders agreed last week to delay the trial for two weeks, allowing time to deal with coronavirus, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/25/trump-impeachment-explained-what-happens-how-does-it-work-senate-trial-guide"">install Joe Biden’s cabinet and let Trump prepare a defence</a>.</p> \n<p>The trial of Trump “has to happen”, Biden has told CNN. While acknowledging the effect on his agenda, the president said there would be <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/25/joe-biden-donald-trump-impeachment-trial"">“a worse effect if it didn’t happen”</a>. Biden said he did not think enough Republican senators would vote for impeachment to convict – which would allow Trump to be disqualified from ever holding office again. Donald Trump’s campaign has meanwhile <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/26/trump-campaign-distances-itself-from-new-patriot-party"">sought to distance him</a> from efforts to create a “Patriot party”, an idea the former president has reportedly toyed with since his election defeat.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>‘Phase vulnerable children back into class’ –</strong> Schools should let teachers select additional vulnerable pupils for an early return to classrooms, the head of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has said. When safe to do so, vulnerable children could be prioritised for a return to the classroom, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jan/26/teachers-in-england-should-pick-vulnerable-pupils-for-early-return"">rather than the reintroduction of entire year groups</a>, Prof Russell Viner said. The children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, has urged Boris Johnson to set out “a clear roadmap” for letting all pupils back. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has responded to Tory MPs who are calling for a roadmap out of Covid-19 restrictions. Hancock said the need to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/25/matt-hancock-fires-coded-warning-at-tories-calling-for-lockdown-easing"">“look at the facts on the ground”</a> and respond accordingly meant it was not possible to lay down a timeline. The European Union has threatened to block exports of vaccine to outside countries such as Britain, after AstraZeneca was accused of failing to satisfactorily explain a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/25/eu-threatens-to-block-covid-vaccine-exports-amid-astrazeneca-shortfall"">shortfall of promised doses to members of the EU</a>. It is feared they may receive only half the 100m shots ordered for the first quarter of 2021. AstraZeneca has said it is “doing everything it can” about the situation.

Their report, Checking Out on Plastics, says plastic bag use remains “incredibly high” and offering reusable “bags for life” is not working. Plastic cutlery sold or given away has risen sharply, from 143m items in 2017 to 195.5m in 2019. The report says supermarkets need to press suppliers of their products to reduce plastic.

The case comes with rape prosecutions in England and Wales at a record low. Reports of rape have increased by almost a third in the four years to March 2020. In that same time the number of rape prosecutions has <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jan/26/victims-speak-out-ahead-of-legal-challenge-to-cps-policy-rape"">fallen 60% to the lowest figure on record</a>. The judicial review mounted against the Crown Prosecution Service by the Centre for Women’s Justice (CWJ) and End Violence Against Women (EVAW) coalition will hear that a more cautious approach has led to a collapse in rape prosecutions. The Guardian has reported that CPS prosecutors were being trained to put a “touch on the tiller” and weed “the weak cases out of the system”. The CPS has denied any change in approach.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Death in the bad old days – </strong>A friar crushed by a cart, another killed by bandits: according to new research, some of the possible misfortunes to have befallen those in centuries past.

But the building industry continues to be affected by shortages of power tools, screws and fixings.

No one knew. There was all this uproar about what I’d said. And I was meeting Amal for dinner that night.”</p> <p>Alamuddin, as she then was, had been hired as a lawyer to argue the Greek case for the return of the marbles and so was able to brief Clooney in depth.

I gotta tell you, it’s been pretty fun chasing some war criminals around.” He says the role also helps him to feel a better father to the couple’s three-year-old twins, Alexander and Ella.</p> <p>“I just feel like, with kids this age, having young children in a period of time when there’s all this craziness, I wanna make sure I can say, ‘these are the things we did to stand against this moment in history’.

She said that after she reported the men’sbehavior, her hours were drastically cut.</p> <p>“No one should have to go through what we have been through,” she said.</p> <p>The complaint, alleges that McDonald’s has failed to comply with the organization’s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and is the first-ever case filed related to sexual harassment at a multinational.</p> <p>Organizers said they filed the complaint with regulators in the Netherlands because McDonald’s’ Dutch offices were the company’s “nerve center” in Europe.</p> <p>The unions claimed any actions filed in the US, where McDonald’s is headquartered, would be met with “unclean hands,” on McDonald’s’ part because sexual harassment “permeates the top ranks of corporate management” there.</p> <p>The complaint does not seek any monetary action, but aims to bring McDonald’s to the table to come up with a plan together to combat sexual harassment at McDonald’s restaurants worldwide.</p> <p>“Mediation is the goal,” said Lance Compa, an international labor law specialist. “It’s not a case of winning or losing, it’s about coming together and finding a joint solution to this problem,” he said. He said that the complainants cannot force McDonald’s to take action, but said these kinds of complaints have proven effective in bringing companies to the negotiation table with unions.</p> <p>Labor unions say one challenge is that McDonald’s insists it is not responsible for employees of its franchised operations, which make up over 90% of McDonald’s restaurants worldwide.</p> <p>“[McDonald’s Corporation] is the employer of all who wear the McDonald’s uniform,” said Kristjan Bragason, the general secretary of the European Federation of Food, Agriculture and Tourism Trade Unions.</p> <p>McDonald’s Corporation said in a statement that they will review the complaint when they receive it.

That year, they went to a national meeting for medical schools. Prakash was there to play badminton and Mythily to display her <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangoli"">rangoli</a> art work. “I spotted her cheering me on and later asked if we could go for an ice-cream,” he says. They soon became good friends, and Prakash admits he found excuses to seek her help in the library. “I was the more serious, studious one, he was always out on his motorbike with his friends, making jokes,” she says. By the fourth year of their studies they were inseparable.</p> <p>When they completed the course in 1992, Mythily went back to her home town of Visakhapatnam, many hours away from Bhopal. Prakash, who lived locally, realised how much he would miss her. “I went to the station to say goodbye and felt this huge sense of loss,” he says. The separation made them realise they wanted more than friendship, but they knew it wasn’t going to be easy. In India many conservative families prefer their children to marry within their caste, and this was the case for both their parents. “Mythily comes from a conservative Brahmin sect, whereas I’m from a traditional warrior clan and we have a very different way of life. She told her parents she was in love and all hell broke loose,” says Prakash.</p> <p>“My mum said it was an absolute no,” Mythily remembers. “My father told me that nobody in the family would accept me.” Prakash’s parents were equally unimpressed by the prospect of their marriage. “They worried it would bring shame on the family and make it harder for my sister to marry.” Undeterred, he took the train to Mythily’s home to try to persuade her parents to change their minds. He was unsuccessful, but they did say that she could return to Bhopal to complete her post-grad training a few months later. The couple stayed in touch through letters and secret calls. Despite her family’s promises it soon became clear she wouldn’t be returning.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""a7976a99abf2f9e2bcab54728df9f4812179ea59""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/a7976a99abf2f9e2bcab54728df9f4812179ea59/51_63_402_502/400.jpg"" alt=""Prakash and Mythily in the Indian Army Medical Corps in 1996"" width=""400"" height=""500"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Prakash and Mythily in the Indian Army Medical Corps in 1996.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Image supplied by Dr Prakash Shankar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“They tried leaning on me to consider other matches. I knew I couldn’t marry anyone else and decided to go,” she says. They left their families and met in Mumbai, where Prakash’s friends could help them to get married. “We couldn’t go to Bhopal because that’s the first place her family would look” says Prakash. “She was flying to Mumbai and I took the train. It was stranded before the final destination and I became distraught thinking I would miss her and she’d be vulnerable in this dangerous city.” Luckily he found another way to get to Mumbai and reached her in time. “Seeing her come out of that airport was the most satisfying moment of my life. It was so good to be back together.”</p> <p>They married the next day before revealing their secret to their furious families. “We moved back to Bhopal to get jobs. I lived with my parents and Mythily was offered accommodation by generous seniors from our university.” In 1994 they moved to Delhi to live together and later joined the Indian Army Medical Corps. From 1995 to 2000 they served together in various field locations and had their first son together in 1997. After leaving the army in 2000, Prakash decided to pursue a career in psychiatry in the UK, working briefly in Darlington before settling in Edinburgh. Mythily joined him in 2002 and their second son was born six years later. “It was a huge transition but I’m now happy here, working as a GP, and Prakash is practising as a psychiatrist,” she says.</p> <p>By the time they left for the UK they had reunited with their families and they both developed close bonds with their in-laws. Mythily lost her father to cancer in 2002 and Prakash’s parents died in a road accident a year later, but they still travel to India to visit her mother. “She came to support us during the initial months when our second son was born and loved Edinburgh,” says Mythily. Despite the difficult start to their relationship, neither has a single regret. “Prakash is so loving and committed to what he does,” says Mythily. “I just love his sense of humour.” He describes her as “his rock”. “Her mental strength and resilience give me a sense of purpose.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Want to share your story?

One that has been <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/16/global-economy-faces-19tn-corporate-debt-timebomb-warns-imf"" title="""">highlighted by the International Monetary Fund</a> is the high level of debt sitting on the balance sheets of UK corporations, government – local and central – and its low-income consumers.</p> <p>The UK was among eight leading countries that the IMF said played host to corporations with debts that were so huge they would struggle to finance them should there ever be a major recession.</p> <p>The current low rate of interest within the eight countries (including the UK, US, Germany and Japan) has encouraged businesses to increase their borrowing, often to finance payouts to shareholders rather than investment, to a point where 40% of the corporate debt pile – some £15tn – would be impossible to service if there were a downturn half as serious as that of a decade ago.</p> <p>Government debt in the UK has also risen, mostly to support the economy during the pandemic, just when Boris Johnson and his ministers wanted to increase spending to fix many of the problems made worse by 10 years of austerity.</p> <p>With a bill for the pandemic that will stretch over the next few years, the government faces the prospect of the overall debt to GDP ratio increasing from the 105% predicted for this financial year to 120% and beyond if austerity is to be reversed.</p> <p>If this wasn’t bad enough, the pandemic has forced millions of low- and middle-income earners to borrow to keep their finances afloat. Aggregate figures for the UK disguise a widening gap between those with and without loans. Mortgage borrowing, for instance, is not at high levels historically, but is increasingly concentrated in a relatively small group of younger households while those over the age of 60, if they are not renting, own their home outright.</p> <p>Likewise, Bank of England figures for consumer borrowing almost disguise more than they illuminate, and a casual glance at the overall figures would leave the chancellor neither shaken nor stirred.</p>  <figure class=""element element-embed"" data-alt=""Sign up to the daily Business Today email"">  <iframe id=""business-today"" name=""business-today"" src=""https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today"" scrolling=""no"" seamless="""" class=""iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe"" height=""52px"" frameborder=""0"" data-component=""email-embed--business-today""></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the UK’s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/nov/12/debt-crisis-warning-uk-records-steep-rise-emergency-borrowing-coronavirus"" title="""">debt charities have warned of a borrowing frenzy</a> by those with the weakest finances, putting a ticking time bomb under the large number of households that spend every penny they earn, and are therefore crucial to the recovery of the economy.</p> <p>In an age of anxiety, when the threat of disease combines with a longer-term fear arising from a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/23/new-covid-variant-and-looming-brexit-disruption-deepen-uk-economic-gloom"" title="""">loss of competitiveness and skilled private sector jobs</a>, these issues will be tricky for any government to manage.</p> <p>That the government should borrow extra funds to get the economy back on track is clear.

A retreat in the week since has put that at closer to $600bn. That puts its value at more than the next seven largest carmakers combined, despite planning to produce a small fraction of the volume of vehicles its rivals churn out every year.</p> <p>For those looking at whether the run can continue, there are some ominous signs. Among the reasons for the shares retreating in the past week was a report that Apple, another of the S&amp;P 500’s heavyweights, was hoping to bring out an electric car in 2024. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/22/apple-plans-self-driving-car-in-2024-with-next-level-battery-technology"" title="""">Reuters reported</a> that Apple’s car would bring self-driving capabilities and significant battery advances.</p> <p>That would be quite an about-face for Tim Cook.

But even without that, the current sky-high Tesla valuations are based on optimism over its autonomous driving systems and solar energy business. Those are two highly competitive and fast-developing fields.</p> <p>Tesla has built up an undeniable lead in battery electric cars, and the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/08/tesla-shares-p-500-index-stock-price"" title="""">impressive fundraising abilities</a> that go with its huge valuation give it a good chance of defending its position. However, the Apple rumours point to an uncomfortable truth about electric car manufacturing: the hardware barriers to entry are much lower than before, and the software battle has barely even begun.</p> <h2>Bond gives MGM a licence to make a killing in the content wars</h2> <p>So it turns out that even uncompromising super-spy James Bond has his price. MGM, the Hollywood studio behind the mega-franchise, is <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/22/hollywood-giant-mgm-puts-itself-up-for-sale-at-5bn"" title="""">in the market for a buyer</a>, touting a potential price tag of $5.5bn (£4.1bn).</p> <p>Only a decade ago MGM, once a Hollywood superpower boasting a library of titles from <em>Gone with the Wind</em> and <em>Ben Hur</em> to the Rocky franchise, was forced into bankruptcy with a debt burden of $4bn.</p> <p>Fast-forward to the Netflix-propelled era of the streaming wars and content owners have become kings, able to command sky-high prices to license, or sell, their products. And the evergreen Bond franchise, now on its 25th instalment (<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/02/no-time-to-die-bond-25-pushed-back-spring-2021"" title="""">delayed until April</a> in the hope of avoiding pandemic restrictions), has a global fanbase few can match.</p> <p>MGM began to sniff out potential buyers at the beginning of the year, holding preliminary talks with Apple and Netflix, among others, before the effort fizzled out. But since then a new generation of deep-pocketed streaming competitors, from <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/01/disney-plus-coming-soon-to-uk-galaxy-netflix-challenge"" title="""">Disney+</a> and Apple TV+ to HBO Max, are fuelling a renewed wave of content hyper-inflation. This month, Disney said its streaming service was doing so well – racing to more than 73 million subscribers in a year, putting it behind only Amazon and Netflix – that it had moved to more than triple its subscriber target and double annual content spending to $15bn by 2024.</p> <p>MGM has been quietly building value, making $1bn in TV and film revenues last year. And it is broadening a perceived over-dependency on Bond, with Rocky spin-off <em>Creed</em> proving a film franchise success as well as TV hits such as <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>.

For the purposes of this show, Adepitan travels first to the Solomon Islands, then to Australia, ending this first stage of his trip in Tasmania. He is, he says, aware that flying to these places is not ideal, but he believes it is important to “see and meet the people being impacted by climate change every day”.</p> <p>One of the most successful points made by the series is that the people being severely impacted by climate change are rarely the people who have contributed much to its increasingly rapid and destructive march. In the Solomon Islands, he meets a woman who would hop across the water to visit the small island where her grandparents had a home. It used to be dense forest. She shows Adepitan a photograph from 10 years ago, and it looks like paradise. She takes him out to its location on a boat, where dead or dying branches of trees now poke out of the water where paradise once stood. The island is gone. Others nearby are becoming smaller by the year.</p> <p>In terms of scientific detail, Ade on the Frontline is not particularly dense, but Adepitan makes the interconnectedness of the crisis seem obvious, demonstrating again and again how great the consequences of even the smallest change can be. Cause and effect loom large here. The ocean is rising, which brings salt water on to the islands and into the trees, which are helping to hold the sand and thus the islands together. The salt kills the trees, and when they die, there is nothing left to hold the land together. “It’s like an island graveyard,” says Adepitan.</p> <p>If that snippet of catastrophe is hard to take, then it only gets worse. Magnificent green sea turtles lay their eggs on Heron Island, on the Great Barrier Reef, but the sand where they lay them is warming up, and that affects the sex of the hatchlings; over the past two decades, 99% of hatchlings have been female. I am all for a feminist turtle utopia myself, but without human intervention, it does not bode well for their breeding future. And on the Australian mainland, in Queensland, the drought is changing the scale and nature of farming, where farming is even still possible. Bushfires have turned parts of the east coast in to a burning hellscape. Sydney is shrouded in smoke, and bats are falling out of trees and dying because of the extreme heat.</p> <p>This is hard-hitting, because it has to be; few can deny the urgency of the climate crisis now, and the ones who do are looking increasingly as if they live on a different planet to the rest of us. But it also does a solid job of balancing stone-cold reality with the question most people want to hear the answer to, particularly on a Sunday evening: can anything be done to stop it?</p> <p>As such, Adepitan goes in search of people who are trying to offer solutions. He is not so much a cool, analytical reporter as a presenter who is continually in awe of the magnitude of what he is seeing, but he is clearly very good with people, and is able to convey a message of hope through them. He meets a company redistributing food that would otherwise be thrown away. One third of food produced globally goes to waste every year, leading to emissions that weren’t even necessary in the first place. If we can learn to do more with less, we may be in with a chance of reducing that.</p> <p>In Tasmania, where Adepitan ends his journey for now, he encounters a scientist attempting to grow giant kelp, to harness its clever carbon-capturing properties, which means catching the invasive sea urchins who love nothing more than a kelp-flavoured snack. If you have ever wanted more information than you know what to do with about sea urchins’ teeth – and anuses, for that matter – then you might be as horrified as Adepitan by the offer of a free and extremely fresh meal.</p> <p>If it all feels like watching the planet play the last level of Tetris, then there is a possibility that we just may be able to win. Paul Gilding, the former head of Greenpeace, tells Adepitan he believes that if we start to see this as an emergency on the scale of a world war, then we may be in with a chance. We have the technology, we have the wealth, we have the innovations. The message is clear: what we need is action from those in power.",False,pillar/arts,Arts,['honor killing']

Perhaps I’m not as confident in myself because of my history.”</p> <p>She said he had questioned her if she had been intimate with older men, and had told her he was comfortable dating women who were decades younger than him.</p> <p>“He also explained that he was fine with anyone over 22,” she said in the interview with CBS’s managing editor, Norah O’Donnell, adding that he had further asked if she had “had trouble” being intimate with anyone because she was previously sexually assaulted.</p> <p>“He asked if I had trouble enjoying being with someone because of my trauma,” she said.</p> <p>“I really was uncomfortable and understood that my boss was asking these questions, so I was trying to answer them.

Can you tell me a bit about this community behind bars?</strong></p> <p>There were so many queer folks and GNC and trans people inside. There were roughly 4,000 people incarcerated at CCWF, eight people in a room, and every room had at least two trans and GNC folks. There were even more queer folks. It’s crazy because we all come from the same communities. It felt like every queer person from these small communities ends up in prison. It’s then when you realize, damn, we’re targeted. It’s very revealing. How does that happen? How are so many of us incarcerated? We’ve all been through the worst of it, and if we don’t fight for us, there isn’t anyone else who is going to come.

People have to understand that a lot of folks are there for survival crimes. They were hungry. They were getting beaten, and they were defending themselves. People need to stop looking at us like: “You’ve been to prison, you can’t be trusted, you don’t belong in society.” Trans, GNC and queer folks, especially if they are Black, are criminalized, and there is no winning in this system.

They constantly misgender us, and that hurts, but that is the least of our problems. They always want to humiliate us. Even the way they handcuff us. If you’re GNC or trans, they twist your arms back and it’s really painful. They make you bend over as they walk you across the yard. You’re the joke of the prison. Staff make fun of you. They talk about our bodies and ask us if we know what we are. They’ll joke about periods. They’ll dangle a tampon in front of you and taunt you. A male guard said he would show me what a “real man” was. I was threatened with rape, and then I was laughed at when I was scared. They would strip me and I’d be naked in a room with male officers. They parade you around. And we would get disciplined more than anyone else. We were abused in every way.</p> <p><strong>What impact did this have on you personally?</strong></p> <p>You feel shame. You want to keep it a secret. It’s hard to tell your family and each other, because you don’t want to be the punchline, you don’t want folks to hear about it. You just try to stay quiet so it goes away. But it doesn’t ever go away. A lot of folks inside have never had any type of therapy. So they get angry. It does something to you mentally. And I think about the times I didn’t speak up, listening to my friends cry and seeing what happened to them, and I feel like, damn, I should have said something about this. There are so many people that were incarcerated with me and we’re constantly apologizing to each other now, realizing we should have said something. Out here, at least there are spaces for us to talk about these things. PTSD is real. I still cry. I wake up crying at night. I have horrible dreams. Sometimes I’m daydreaming and tears are just rolling down my eyes, because of what I had to live with for so long.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--inline""> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes we can’t speak, but we know what those teary eyes mean</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>How did you decide to start organizing? That must have been terrifying.</strong></p> <p>I didn’t decide to start organizing until my last year in prison, because I was so scared of retaliation. They can cut off all your lifelines – they stop your mail, rip up your pictures, it’s horrible. But after being in there for so long, I decided I was sick of it and I would blow the whistle and fight back, even if I had to go through retaliation. They do what they want with you. They come down hard. They’ll make you strip. They give you write ups. They discipline you. You literally have to let them abuse you. But we started organizing anyway. And we had a network of folks that supported us on the outside and helped us create #MeToo Behind Bars.</p> <p><strong>What tactics did you use when you actually organized with others inside?</strong></p> <p>You have to get super creative. You’re not allowed to be in groups of more than three or you can get in trouble. They can label you a gang. And so we had to figure out other ways to talk to each other. And a lot of us didn’t go to school, so sometimes we’d get a dictionary and figure out how to write our grievances together. We’d help one another, but in secrecy. You can’t let the officers know you’re organizing on the inside, because then everyone has to deal with retaliation. If you get caught, that’s it.</p> <p>So you have to find new ways to keep it a secret. You have to meet in hidden places wherever you can, and figure out who can bring back messages. You have to trust each other. Sometimes you have to figure out how to talk without talking. I know that sounds so crazy, but you can see someone with a certain look and you know something has happened to them and you have to figure out what’s going on. Sometimes we can’t speak, but we know what those teary eyes mean.</p> <p><strong>You filed the lawsuit in 2017 – do you think the guards or the institution have changed at all?</strong></p> <p>Two of our plaintiffs are still incarcerated, and the case is stuck in litigation. We’re still waiting. But I’ve heard that other folks are speaking up or they are writing grievances or considering suing. I think more folks are empowered. That is a big deal, just to hear that folks want to sue, that they are going to fight back and stand up to retaliation – that is amazing. Sometimes when there is media attention around these cases, the officers will back down for a bit. But eventually they go back to their behaviors. It doesn’t matter. Or they’ll just change the way they attack you. Just because we’re exposing these institutions doesn’t mean it’s going to stop. They’re not just going to give up their power. This is going to be a long fight.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--inline""> <blockquote> <p>Even if we change things a little bit, the problem is not going away. The violence comes from these systems</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Beyond litigation, how do you protest and stop this kind of abuse?</strong></p> <p>It’s not going to be fixed with reform. There is no fixing this. We can’t keep these systems in place and just make them better. They are still going to be super violent. Gender-based violence isn’t going to end when you fire certain officers or put certain officers in jail. This is the system and this is how it works, and even if we change things a little bit, the problem is not going away. The violence comes from these systems. I hope people really start listening to the folks that have been through it, and start thinking about prison abolition – thinking of how we can better our communities without these systems. These prisons are supposed to “rehabilitate” you, but instead they just continuously punish you. There is no help.</p> <p><strong>Now that you’re out, what has it been like for you to watch the Covid-19 <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/03/california-prisons-coronavirus-covid-19-health"">catastrophe</a> in California’s prisons – to see thousands get infected and dozens lose their lives?</strong></p> <p>It exposes that they don’t give a shit. They’d rather leave people in there who have months left of their sentence and leave them at risk of dying. We ain’t shit to them. They don’t care about our lives. They’d rather take those last few months that they think we owe them. We don’t matter. The governor has to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/california-prisons-elderly-women-clemency-coronavirus"">release</a> more folks – folks who have two years left in their sentence, folks who have been imprisoned for 20 years, folks over 60, folks with medical conditions who could easily die. With more folks out, they could at least socially distance more on the inside, and folks could live. We wouldn’t have to talk about who lost their life today inside of prison.</p> <p><strong>How should people on the outside who are sympathetic to the experiences of incarcerated people get involved?</strong></p> <p>People should look up local organizations that do this work wherever they live. Find the closest one and ask what kind of support they need. And I hope people start to have these conversations at home, with their families. What would it be like if we didn’t have police? Beyond that, more people need to listen to our stories. There are hundreds of people saying the same thing as me. Believe us, like they did with the larger #MeToo movement when the public started believing women more. Us too. We deserve that. It’s so hard to change the narrative. People think we deserve this punishment, that we are liars. It’s time to give us a chance.</p> <p>•••</p> <p><em>The state declined to comment to the Guardian on Rojas’s specific claims. </em><em>California has denied </em><em>their allegations in court, but a judge has ruled that </em><em>the retaliation and excessive force claims in their case can move forward.

One of the standard tricks of the Covid-19-era illiberal populist is to reach for religion when you are being accused of incompetence. Donald Trump posed for photos with the Bible, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/24/erdogan-prayers-hagia-sophia-museum-turned-mosque"">converted the Hagia Sophia</a> into a mosque, and in Poland Jarosław Kaczyński, the leader of the Law and Justice party (PiS), has resorted to an almost total ban on abortion.</p> \n<p>A ruling from <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/22/poland-rules-abortion-due-to-foetal-defects-unconstitutional"">Poland’s constitutional tribunal</a> last week outlawed abortion in cases where the foetus is severely damaged or malformed. This in practice now means almost all forms of abortion are banned.</p> \n<p>Poland already had some of the strictest abortion legislation in the EU. In the three decades since the end of communism the country has lived under what is called the “abortion compromise”. Public opinion favoured retaining liberal post-communist abortion laws. But politicians, bowing to the power of the Catholic church, tightened the law anyway in the mid-1990s without recourse to a referendum, leaving foetal abnormality as one of the only available routes for women seeking terminations. Since 1997, of approximately 1,000 legal terminations performed annually in Poland, the vast majority cite severe foetal abnormality. After last week’s ruling by the tribunal, this too will be illegal.</p> \n<p>The <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/24/thousands-join-poland-protests-against-strict-abortion-laws"">street protests</a> of recent days are on a scale not seen in Poland since 2016. Back then a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/30/how-polands-far-right-government-is-pushing-abortion-underground"">grassroots women’s movement</a> forced Kaczyński to back down from proposals to criminalise anyone seeking abortion. Clad in black, thousands took to the streets demanding that parliament reject the plans. The protesters were furious, but they also had hope. Kaczyński’s party duly shelved the planned changes.</p> \n<p>This time, the same anger is there but accompanied by a sense that this ultra-conservative government (which unlawfully appointed loyalist judges to the constitutional court) is engaged in a form of humiliation of Polish women. Many who had until now remained silent about politics are speaking publicly. The slogan “women’s hell” has gone viral. A renowned sportswoman and two-time Olympic medal winner, <a href=""https://www.onet.pl/sport/onetsport/wyrok-tk-ws-aborcji-justyna-kowalczyk-tekieli-zabrala-glos-burza-w-internecie/x28xv3j,d87b6cc4"">Justyna Kowalczyk-Tekieli, said</a>: “Polish women are diminished to the role of incubators. I do not know how one could condemn a woman to give birth to a dead foetus.”</p> \n<p>So why is Kaczyński, in the middle of a global pandemic, lining up with a minority of reactionary anti-abortion activists allied to the Catholic church to declare war on women’s rights? Partly, this is another line of attack on the post-cold war liberal democratic order he holds in such contempt. More pragmatically it is a move by a leader on the back foot as he fights one losing battle against Covid-19 and another to keep a fragile governing coalition from falling apart. Using the constitutional court is a trick to dodge a repeat of 2016 and any potential pushback by parliament.</p> \n<figure class=""element element-atom""> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=""da386cc1-af8e-4566-a3ea-cfde7b357a97"" data-atom-type=""media""> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OiusAxfclcA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0""></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On the far right, meanwhile, Kaczyński has to compete with the Confederation, a party that is gaining ground with a more radical set of policies. Kaczyński’s move to revive the anti-abortion law aims to boost the coalition, marginalise the Confederation and thank the church for its support in recent years. It is also a ‘“populistainment” classic beloved of the PiS: light a fire, arouse strong emotions and make spectators choose sides. Kaczyński’s address to party rank and file via social media on Tuesday night, calling for a defence of the Catholic church “at all costs” was a perfect example of this tactic.</p> \n<p>This time, however, the populist playbook isn’t quite working. A new political faultline has been created and Kaczyński can’t control the outcome or put the genie back in the bottle. He has another three years until elections but women who had shown no interest in party politics are outraged and on the march. Heavily armed policemen and vans have had to be deployed around Kaczyński’s villa in Warsaw.</p> \n<p>Almost 300 years ago, Montesquieu noted that while a despot is busy enslaving his subjects he may also be enslaving himself. This is the trap the embattled Kaczyński is falling into. As he deprives Polish citizens of their freedom of choice, he is becoming increasingly ensnared by the distorted political system he has himself created. And it could eventually consign him to the scrapheap of Polish history.</p> \n<p>His cynical and potentially incendiary exploitation of religion reflects his political powerlessness in the Covid era. Liberals should draw their own practical conclusions and learn from his failing tactics to come up with a convincing strategy for the future.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Karolina Wigura is a historian, political editor of the Polish weekly Kultural Liberalna and a fellow at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Berlin.

As we think about those directly and indirectly impacted, we must also continue to think about what needs to change.</p> <p>In December 2020, <a href=""https://christchurchattack.royalcommission.nz/the-report/"">the report of the royal commission</a> into these events was made public. The <a href=""https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/checkpoint/audio/2018776247/islamic-women-s-council-responds-to-terror-attack-report"">findings were a disappointment</a> in not holding any person or agency negligent, though the body of the report detailed a number of failings. The government has committed to implementing the 44 recommendations, with <a href=""https://dpmc.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2020-12/CAB-20-SUB-0513-continuing-action-to-improve-social-inclusion.pdf"">some announcements already made</a>.</p> <p>One set of recommendations relates to hate speech and censorship laws, with <a href=""https://christchurchattack.royalcommission.nz/publications/comp/introduction/"">a separate paper</a> detailing the main issues. New Zealand’s current hate speech laws largely reside in the Human Rights Act, and relate to race, ethnicity, nationality and colour. The laws don’t include gender, religion, sexuality, or any of the other bases of discrimination used in the rest of that act or the Bill of Rights Act. This is an anomaly that needs to be changed.</p> <p>The government has signalled a willingness to change a law that has only been successfully used once. The commissioners recommend that these provisions be moved to the Crimes Act and simplified. There is much research to show that <a href=""https://www.theworkshop.org.nz/publications/online-hate-and-offline-harm-2019"">online hate leads to real and significant harms</a>, and that it <a href=""https://www.isdglobal.org/isd-publications/hate-speech-and-radicalisation-online-the-occi-research-report/"">has a role in radicalisation</a>.</p> <p>Christchurch was unique in that it was the first instance of a killer livestreaming his attack, giving commentary as he carried out the atrocity. The promotion of the live stream, with the help of algorithms, <a href=""https://www.cnet.com/news/how-the-new-zealand-mosque-shooting-was-designed-to-go-viral/"">ensured the footage went viral</a>.</p> <p>A <a href=""https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2020/0268/latest/LMS294551.html"">new bill</a> written last year passed first reading on 11 February, after a change in composition of the government made it possible. It seeks to address the livestreaming, but has some concerning elements that could put communities at risk.</p> <p>The Films, Videos and Publications Classifications Act is the one which sets out ratings for films. It allows for material to be deemed objectionable, so that it is illegal to hold or distribute. There is a process to be followed, and the reasons are made public. People have the right to appeal through the courts if they disagree with the decision.</p> <p>The proposed amendments to this bill allow the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) to appoint inspectors, who can issue interim notices deeming material objectionable. They can do this based on “reasonable grounds” – a highly subjective test, open to bias, discrimination and opening up the possibility to harass individuals and communities.</p> <p>The Classifications Office is an independent organisation, though funded by government and administered by DIA. It cannot be influenced by the state. An inspector employed by DIA is the government, and can enforce takedowns via an electronic system. The interim notice can be appealed, but that takes time to prepare and action.</p> <p>As an example, a person livestreams a protest. Police arrive and there is violence resulting in the death of a person. The person may have shared the video widely as evidence of a state crime, but the inspector can order an interim takedown. If the person continues to distribute, they are now committing an offence which could result in their arrest.</p> <p>Their ability to appeal against the order is limited while incarcerated, but even if the appeal is successful, it may take four or five days. In which time, the arrest and any charges may cause them to lose their employment, be evicted from their rental property or suffer other damage.</p> <p>The bill introduces the electronic takedown system, but provides no specific details of what it will look like nor how it will be administered. Those details will be provided in regulations, which have a <a href=""https://dpmc.govt.nz/our-business-units/cabinet-office/supporting-work-cabinet/cabinet-manual/7-executive-legislation-7"">much less rigorous process</a>. An electronic system will give strong powers to government, and the details of any such system must be subject to public debate, submissions and intense scrutiny.</p> <p>Any legislation should be assessed considering the worst-case scenario – what I like to call “the Trump test”. How might a hostile government misuse this legislation, and what checks and balances are in place to prevent that misuse? In this case, there aren’t enough.</p> <p>While legislation serves a purpose, it deals with events after they happen. More important is the work to prevent such an event happening in the first place. Understanding the path to radicalisation and effective measures to stop it happening are crucial to any government response to the Christchurch attacks.</p> <p>The best solutions happen with input from and the support of communities. Government alone cannot solve these issues. It requires strong partnerships with communities, giving them the resources and power to make a difference. Two years on from the attacks, we are still waiting for that to happen.",False,pillar/news,News,['gender-based violence']

Someone earning £55,000 a year has to repay half the child benefit they or their partner received that tax year. For those earning more than £60,000, the charge is equivalent to 100% of the child benefit received.</p> <p>It is controversial because HMRC chases the person earning above the income threshold rather than the recipient of the money.</p> <p>Every year the high-income charge catches out thousands of families who are either unaware of it or who find themselves unwittingly earning more than they thought.</p> <p>A worker who earns a headline rate of £48,000 a year can find that their true income for tax reasons is above £50,000 because they receive other benefits such as a company vehicle or even private medical insurance. Other workers have been caught out after receiving a pay rise, or a bonus that has tipped them over the £50,000 threshold.</p> <p>Child benefit is worth £21.05 a week for the first child and £13.95 for additional children.</p> <p>A family with two children receive £1,820 a year and some people have reported being told they must pay back <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/6yeyij/high_income_child_benefit_tax_charge_question/"">as much as £660 a month</a>.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Those receiving the most recent HMRC letters face having to assemble proof of their income</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In some extreme cases, workers who moved in with a partner who already had children have been pursued by HMRC for thousands of pounds.

Those ignoring the letters face a possible investigation and the imposition of fines.</p> <p>Critics of the scheme have long argued that HMRC knows exactly how much most employees have earned and where they live, and yet it requires consumers to tell it they are liable for the charge.</p> <p>In 2019, Guardian Money reported on the case of a woman who <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/feb/09/mother-hit-with-4500-tax-charge-for-child-benefit"">had received a £5,400 demand</a>. A pay rise had sent her over the threshold but HMRC had not alerted her to the fact that she would face the charge.</p> <p>Families can choose to opt out of getting child benefit payments and thereby avoid the charge, and many have done this. The other way to avoid the charge is to reduce your taxable income by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/sep/28/child-benefit-pension-contributions-higher-earners"">paying more into your pension</a>.

Prosecutions and convictions in rape cases are now at the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jul/30/convictions-fall-record-low-england-wales-prosecutions"">lowest level</a> since records began. Despite police recording more than 55,000 rapes in 2019-20, there were just 2,102 prosecutions and 1,439 convictions. Last year 1,500 fewer rapists were convicted than three years ago.</p> <p>The government launched an <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-sets-out-key-measures-to-tackle-violence-against-women-and-girls"">end-to-end review</a> of the treatment of rape in the criminal justice system in March 2019 in an attempt to understand the decline. It was due to report in March 2020, but has been delayed and is expected to report by the end of the year.</p> <h2><strong>What are the proposed targets</strong><strong>?</strong></h2> <p>They would aim to increase the number of rape cases making it to trial. The primary proposed target is an increase in the number of “effective trials” – that is, a trial that commences on a scheduled date and reaches a conclusion. It does not relate to the outcome of the trial. This would be done through more “high quality” referrals from the police to the CPS, and an increase in both rates and volumes of defendants prosecuted.</p> <h2><strong>Who </strong><strong>would enforce the targets?</strong></h2> <p>It is unclear. The police are answerable to the Home Office and the CPS is supervised by Her Majesty’s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate, which comes under the Attorney General’s Office.</p> <h2><strong>Are targets potentially problematic?</strong></h2> <p>Yes. Setting benchmarks can have unintended negative consequences. There are concerns that if targets are set before the underlying reasons for the decline in prosecutions are fully identified, the opportunity for change could be missed.</p> <p>The CPS previously had targets relating to “levels of ambition” <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/13/secret-cps-targets-may-have-led-to-cases-being-dropped"">for a 60% conviction rate</a> in rape cases. But they were dropped after prosecutors conceded they were not appropriate and may have acted as a “perverse incentive” deterring the prosecution of less straightforward cases.</p> <p>Women’s groups have expressed concerns about the implementation of targets. “The danger is that a target creates an external objective which police and CPS yet again change their behaviour to meet, all the while still not focusing on victim needs and rights,” said Sarah Green of the End Violence Against Women coalition.</p> <h2><strong>How </strong><strong>would the </strong><strong>changes be achieved?</strong></h2> <p>The police and CPS will likely argue for more funding after more than a decade of cuts and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. Between 2009 and 2019, <a href=""https://www.tuc.org.uk/blogs/crisis-criminal-justice-too-acute-new-pm-ignore"">the CPS budget was cut by 25%</a> – with 96% of prosecutors surveyed by the FDA civil service union believing it no longer had enough lawyers to fulfil its duties.

But it isn’t exactly a tale of two French Lieutenant’s Women, despite the inevitably tense walk up the fabled Cobb, filmed in thoughtful longshot. The complicated power balance between the principals makes the comparison incorrect. Actually, the film that swam into my head afterwards was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/15/the-piano-review-jane-campion-holly-hunter"">Jane Campion’s The Piano</a>.</p> <p>Ammonite is an absorbing drama that sensationally brings together two superlative performers: <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/saoirse-ronan"">Saoirse Ronan</a> and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/katewinslet"">Kate Winslet</a>. Combining these alpha players doubles or actually quadruples the screen voltage, and their passion co-exists with the cool, calm subtlety with which Lee inspects the domestic circumstances in which their paths crossed. It is a film about a real-life relationship speculatively reimagined with some artistic licence. But I have to say that – paradoxically – the figures of this bodiced and bonneted movie, despite being based on real life, seemed a tiny bit less real than the fictional figures of his previous film, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/22/gods-own-country-review-a-dales-answer-to-brokeback-thats-a-very-british-love-story"">God’s Own Country</a>. Yet they’re just as passionate.</p> <p>The heroine is <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/dec/16/hopes-rise-for-statue-of-pioneering-fossil-hunter-mary-anning"">Mary Anning</a>, a pioneering 19th-century palaeontologist whose ideas and extraordinary fossil finds in Lyme Regis were coolly appropriated by the male scientific establishment from whose societies and clubs she was excluded, and probably had to put up with mediocre, mutton-chopped ninnies treating her as an eccentric amateur. The real Anning took comfort in her close friendship with fellow geologist Charlotte Murchison, whose own expertise seems to have equalled and predated her husband’s.</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA-JpynpC5c""                                                                        >  <iframe height=""259"" width=""460"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MA-JpynpC5c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Lee presents things differently. Winslet plays Anning as a tough, capable but careworn woman, one grown accustomed to not declaring her feelings. Winslet gives her a look of perpetual wary resentment but fierce intellectual assertion. She is a scientist forced to be a shopkeeper, running a tourist trap in Lyme Regis (“Anning’s Fossils &amp; Curios”), selling seashell-encrusted hand mirrors and the like. This subsidises her serious scientific work, scouring the shore for fossils, a beachcomber for ancient evolutionary secrets. Mary lives with her placid mother: a ripe performance from Gemma Jones.</p> <p>A smoothly condescending London scientist swans in, professing to admire Anning’s work. This is Roderick Murchison (James McArdle) who has in tow his catatonically depressed wife Charlotte (Ronan). He asks if, in return for a substantial cash payment, he might leave his wife behind to lodge with Anning for a while, so that the sea air and healthy scientific thoughts will cure her “melancholia”. But Charlotte’s melancholia is more to do with Roderick’s passionless dullness, and the more she stays with Mary, the more a new situation is revealed.</p> <p>Lee shows us the windswept seaspray in which Mary spends her days, crunching along the shore, grimly inspecting stones like an old prospector. Ronan’s Charlotte is glacial and pale as she gingerly picks her way along the beach behind her. Charlotte’s husband had been plaintively wondering where his clever wife disappeared to, and as her relationship with Mary progresses, and her mood thaws, Ronan shows us exactly where that pretty cleverness has got to – it was there all along. And it is precisely Charlotte’s effervescent, coquettish daring that allows her to take the initiative in their affair.</p> <p>We can see Mary and Charlotte grow 10 years younger before our eyes – and when Mary laughs, Winslet looks the way she did in Titanic. Winslet and Ronan don’t need CGI to do this.</p> <p>The question arises about Mary’s identity in the wider world: she seems to have had some sort of abandoned friendship with a local woman, Elizabeth (an elegant, sensitive performance from <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/stage/fiona-shaw"">Fiona Shaw</a>). But there is no homophobic disapproval in the 21st-century sense, and Lee dispenses with the old urban myth about Victoria and Victorian society not recognising the existence of gay women. At one stage, Charlotte kisses Mary in front of the housemaid, and, in answer to Mary’s panicky look, Charlotte just shrugs that this is just a “servant”, who in turn grimaces at her snobbery. Class is paramount in the recognition or non-recognition of sexuality.</p> <p>It is tempting to look for the metaphorical properties of fossil-hunting: the cracking open of stones, the discovery of secrets, the thrillingly real evidence of life. Of course, Charlotte and Mary’s love is not a fossil; it lives ecstatically in the flesh-and-blood present. But for Mary that’s what the ammonites and ichthyosaurs do as well. It is a love story that is also a fascinating artefact: quixotic, romantic, erotic.",False,pillar/arts,Arts,['forced marriage']

At about 9pm, the authorities carried out a dead dog, followed by two live ones and a cat. Then they pulled out a woman’s body.</p> <p>Jessi, a 23-year-old psychology student at a local university, had gone missing a week earlier. On 24 October, she hadn’t appeared at the spot where her parents usually picked her up after class. Within a few minutes, she called her mother to say she was going out, abruptly hung up, then texted to add, “Don’t worry, I’m with Óscar”.</p> <p>That was strange. Óscar, the father of Jessi’s 10-month-old son, was no longer in the picture. Maybe they’d been talking, the Jaramillos thought. But when Jessi hadn’t returned home by morning and her parents’ calls went straight to voicemail, they knew something was wrong. She never stayed out all night. Between school, church groups and her baby, she didn’t have the time.</p> <p>Growing increasingly concerned, Jessi’s older brother logged on to her computer and tracked her phone through her Google account. A pin appeared in Villas Santín, a satellite of Toluca about nine miles from the university. Jessi’s parents, her brother and his fiancee piled into their van.</p> <p>After knocking on a few doors, the family was told by a neighbour to check out No 136 Ponciano Díaz street, which they said was home to a strange young man. The man always wore a black shirt tucked into black cargo pants, with calf-high black combat boots. He was muscular, about 6ft tall, and had a military-style buzz cut. This wasn’t the first time a young woman had entered the house and not come out again, the neighbour said.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2021/mar/26/hunting-the-men-who-kill-women-mexicos-femicide-detective-podcast"">Hunting the men who kill women: Mexico’s femicide detective – podcast </a> </p> </aside>  <p>The neighbour’s description matched one Jessi had given six months earlier of a former classmate who had repeatedly asked her out and then begun stalking her. The family had helped Jessi transfer to another local university so that she could get away from him. She wasn’t with her ex: she must be with this other man, whose name also happened to be Óscar. Now, they rushed over to the address, a two-storey concrete house with iron bars on the front door and windows. A bright yellow sign warned: “Caution: attack dog.”</p> <p>The family knocked, but no one answered. So they divided up. Two stayed behind to keep watch over the house, while the other two drove over to a prosecutor’s office in Toluca to file a missing person’s report. They were starting to panic. There are more than <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/mexico-disappearance-lopez-obrador/2020/07/13/44e04a50-c089-11ea-b4f6-cb39cd8940fb_story.html"" title="""">73,000</a> missing people in Mexico, collectively known as “the disappeared”. Their faces haunt billboards and social media feeds, alongside pleas for help returning them to loved ones. In 2019, #We’reLookingForYou and #AmberAlert were Mexican Twitter’s top trending social or political hashtags. Many of the missing are never found.</p> <p>At the prosecutor’s office, Jessi’s father told officials about her stalker, the message she had sent the previous night, and how they had tracked her phone to Villas Santín. According to the Jaramillos, the officials shrugged them off. Jessi’s message indicated she was with Óscar García Guzmán of her own free will, they said, and besides, they couldn’t report her as a missing person until 72 hours had passed from the time she was last seen. The Jaramillos insisted that the officials launch an investigation and refused to budge. After several hours, the officials relented.</p> <p>That night, police knocked on the house’s door and when no one answered, left. The following morning, Saturday 26 October, García emerged. The Jaramillos, who had been eating and sleeping in their van opposite the house since the previous day in order to keep watch, approached García to ask him to let them in to check on Jessi. García shouted that he hadn’t seen her and that they couldn’t come in without a warrant. Then he called the police on them. Officers came, took statements outside, and once again left. But before they did, García agreed to go to the prosecutor’s office to leave a statement regarding Jessi’s missing person’s case – though not until Monday. He had homework to do over the weekend, he said. The following day, a judge denied a search warrant request for García’s house.</p> <p>At about 8.30am on Monday 28 October, García took a taxi over to the prosecutor’s office. In his interview, an account of which I was shown, he described Jessi as a “friend with benefits” whom he’d known for a few months. He stated that the two had met up on the afternoon of 24 October, bought a pizza and gone back to his place to eat it, after which she had left in a taxi to see the father of her baby, the other Óscar.</p> <p>At 11.45am, García returned home from the prosecutor’s office. Then 20 minutes later, he stepped out again. In a video the Jaramillos took, you can see him stride by, clad in his black, military-style uniform – like an overgrown action figure – a backpack slung over his shoulder, a phone clutched to his ear. With his free hand he flashes them a peace sign before disappearing out of the camera’s frame. According to police, at this point, he skipped town.</p> <p>On 29 October, five days after Jessi had first disappeared, a judge approved a second search of García’s house based on new evidence – CCTV footage showing Jessi entering García’s house and not coming out again. The following night, police swarmed the house. By then, Jessi was dead. According to local press reports, she had been strangled and left in a bath.</p> <p>The Jaramillos were exhausted, heartbroken and furious. But then, a few days later, a woman named Frida Guerrera knocked on their door. She told them she could help them track down Jessi’s killer.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Frida Guerrera is a journalist who hunts down men who kill women. A year before Jessi Jaramillo’s death, Guerrera had moved to Villas Santín, just a few blocks away from the house where Jessi’s body was found, a wild coincidence she later ascribed to fate. “I’ve always believed the girls tell me where to go,” she told me when we met last year. “Call it magic.”</p> <p>For the past five years, Guerrera, who is 50, has devoted nearly every waking hour to searching for disappeared women and memorialising the victims of femicide. A distinct crime recognised in many Latin American countries, femicide is defined as the murder of a woman because of her gender. Some of the signs that characterise a femicide, according to Mexico’s criminal code, include sexual violence, a relationship between the victim and the murderer, prior threats and aggression, and the display of the body in a public space. UN Women calls Latin America the most lethal place for women outside war zones. More femicides are committed in Mexico <a href=""https://oig.cepal.org/en/indicators/femicide-or-feminicide"" title="""">than in any other country in the</a> region, except Brazil.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""65b26e0367c09e83a97270c1b12e657d56efd5ec""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/65b26e0367c09e83a97270c1b12e657d56efd5ec/0_130_3000_1800/1000.jpg"" alt=""Frida Guerrera in 2018"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Frida Guerrera in 2018.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Luis Cortes/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every day, Guerrera trawls national and regional news outlets, identifies femicide cases and catalogues victims’ age, location and the method of their murder on a spreadsheet. She then selects a few cases to write up on her blog, a never-ending scroll of pictures of victims, which she gathers from interviews with their parents. “She’s one of a kind,” says Jan-Albert Hootsen, the Mexico representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists. “She has been constantly shedding light on specific cases of women who have fallen victim to violence, which is something that very few people in Mexico have actually done.”</p> <p>Throughout the day, Guerrera posts missing person notices on her Twitter and Facebook pages and asks her tens of thousands of social media followers to help find the women or the men who targeted them. Guerrera claims that she has helped police find more than 40 killers since 2017. Though there is no official count, the prosecutor’s office for Mexico State, where Guerrera is based, confirmed she has helped to resolve a number of murder cases.</p> <p>The night Jessi Jaramillo’s body was found, Guerrera was drawn to García’s house by the crowd of police. From that moment on, she kept a close eye on Jessi’s case. On 1 November, two days after Jessi was found, two more bodies were dug out from the property’s back patio: 25-year-old Martha Patricia Nava Sotelo, missing since February 2019, and 27-year-old Adriana González Hernández, missing since March 2017. The media in Mexico State began covering the killings daily, calling García “the Monster of Toluca”. It was then, shortly after the Jaramillos had returned home from burying their daughter, Guerrera showed up at their house.</p> <p>Guerrera does this work in part because the police regularly fail to. “They’re inept,” she told me. The journalist Lydiette Carrión, who spent more than six years investigating how Mexico State handles femicide investigations, found that cases are often kicked from one agent to another like Hacky Sacks and that mothers are sometimes shown victims’ bones and asked if they can identify their daughters. The rise in violence, following the inception of the drug war 15 years ago, has overwhelmed Mexico’s police, and most violent crimes go unsolved.</p> <p>Police incompetence is compounded by corruption: federal money that is meant to go to training and paying skilled local police gets siphoned off by local officials instead. Misogyny also plays a large role: many police assume that young women have simply run off with their boyfriends and refuse to open cases before 72 hours have passed – even though a national protocol clearly states that a search should be initiated immediately. “What we see from investigators is bad performance from the very start,” says Nancy Lopez, director of the Mexican Commission for the Defense and Promotion of Human Rights. Only about 12% of Mexicans say they have much confidence in state police or prosecutors.</p> <p>To find García, Guerrera began by writing a blog post lambasting the authorities for waiting a whole week to search the house. If, in person, Guerrera’s tone oscillates between deadpan and sedate, online she is brash and combative. She described Garcia as an attention-starved “<em>Don Nadie</em>” (Mister Nobody), and asked readers to get in touch with any information relevant to the case. She published the blog on 11 November.</p> <p>That same day, Guerrera came across a Facebook post from 28 October, the day García fled town. A certain “Alexander Anderson” – the account’s profile picture showed García at a martial arts studio – had posted a screenshot of the missing person notices for Jessi Jaramillo, and the two other women who were subsequently found buried under the patio. Above their pictures he’d written, “To catch a serial killer, you must think like one”.</p> <p>Guerrera felt a surge of anger. On Facebook and Twitter, she wrote, “Óscar García Guzmán is an idiot who thinks he’s so great. I’m waiting for you here,” along with a closeup of his face. She remembers thinking, “He’s going to get mad. He’s going to look for me.”</p> <p>A little over a week later, he did.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For Guerrera, violence against women is personal. She was born Verónica Villalvazo in 1970, and grew up in Ecatepec, a sprawling municipality on the outer edge of Mexico’s capital. In recent years, Ecatepec has sometimes been described as the most dangerous place in the country to be a woman – between January 2015 and March 2019, at least <a href=""https://www.animalpolitico.com/2019/09/ecatepec-en-4-anos-han-asesinado-a-1258-mujeres-pero-solo-53-son-considerados-como-feminicidio/"" title="""">1,258 women</a> were killed there – but back when she was a child, Guerrera said it felt safe.</p> <p>As a young woman, Guerrera studied psychology, fell in love, had a child, fell out of love and met somebody new. In the early 2000s, she started reading articles about <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/02/mexico"" title="""">shocking murders</a> in Ciudad Juárez, where women had been strangled and arranged in public spaces like morbid trophies. It was the first time she remembers reading about these kinds of crimes. But all that was taking place so far away – 1,200 miles north of Mexico City – on the border with the US. Then the violence hit close to home. Her new boyfriend started beating her, and the violence slowly escalated. He broke her nose, then several ribs. On 3 May 2006, when she was 36 and had been with him seven years, she left. She moved to Oaxaca to reinvent herself.</p> <p>“I never saw myself as a victim,” she told me, plainly, but she hungered to write about others who had suffered at the hands of violent men. In Oaxaca, she joined a left-leaning radio collective and began reporting on local corruption and victims of state-sponsored violence, especially women and children. Guerrera’s work was lonely and dangerous. Death threats were routine, and she isolated herself from friends and family to protect them. One time she opened her front door to find the crushed corpse of one of her cats lying in front of her. Then one day she was grabbed off the street, blindfolded, hustled into a van, beaten and told to leave Oaxaca. This happened on three occasions, she told me.</p> <p>To protect her identity, Guerrera’s producer suggested she come up with an alias. She thought of one immediately: Frida, after the artist Frida Kahlo. She added “Guerrera” later after overhearing someone refer to her as a “warrior”. The producer encouraged Guerrera to try out a new, safer job: working on the communications team for a young senator running for Oaxaca governor. The senator won, and hired Guerrera full-time. She stayed for the next six years, safe under a friendly administration.</p> <p>In 2016, Guerrera moved back to Mexico City to live with a new partner. Coming back to the city she’d left a decade earlier, it seemed like a new place entirely, transformed by Mexico’s drug war, which had claimed the lives of <a href=""https://theconversation.com/a-decade-of-murder-and-grief-mexicos-drug-war-turns-ten-70036"" title="""">150,000 people</a> over the previous decade. The surge in violence had created a far more lethal country for women, one in which they were more likely to die in the crossfire, but also in private, domestic settings. One afternoon, Guerrera found herself searching the internet for stories of murdered women. She found 123 different cases. “It broke me,” she said. She saved the women’s names, ages and dates and location of death on a spreadsheet. Later, she got in touch with their parents to talk about who their daughters were, and why no one protected them. That’s how Frida’s Blog was born.</p> <p>She wasn’t the only journalist to start taking a more serious interest in femicide stories. Even before #MeToo broke in the US in 2017, the Mexican Twitter campaign #MiPrimerAcoso (#MyFirstAssault) in 2016 gave voice to an increasingly vocal women’s movement. “This feminist movement allowed women to insist that gender issues be part of the public agenda,” says journalist Valeria Duran. “We were able to fight our editors.” Whereas stories about murdered women had, until then, been relegated to the “<em>nota roja”</em> – a lurid crime beat rife with victim blaming and gratuitous violence – they pushed for more sensitive coverage that focused on the systemic reasons behind the killings.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""7c0d561e6b7c39a1d9f77854f7028a5d04768a78""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/7c0d561e6b7c39a1d9f77854f7028a5d04768a78/0_236_3543_2126/1000.jpg"" alt=""Frida Guerrera with relatives of Guadalupe Medina Pichardo – ‘Lupita’ – a four-year-old girl found dead in Mexico State, January 2018."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Frida Guerrera with relatives of Guadalupe Medina Pichardo – ‘Lupita’ – a four-year-old girl found dead in Mexico State, January 2018.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: GDA/El Universal/Mexico/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But if Guerrera was part of a movement of journalists chronicling the murders of women, she went one step further. She started trying to solve them, too. It started in early 2017, when an unidentified four-year-old girl was found dead in a dumping ground in Mexico State, naked save for a green T-shirt and a pair of ruby-coloured socks. The case made national headlines, often accompanied by a blurry picture of the girl’s dead body, her face out of the frame. The press called the unknown girl “Little Red-Socks”, but the investigation into her murder made little progress.</p> <p>Guerrera couldn’t stand that the child remained anonymous, or the fairytale name by which she was known. To her, the case represented the casualness with which the media and the government treated crimes against women and girls. She couldn’t just write about the girl and move on. So she went online and on the radio and asked her growing base of followers to help identify the girl.</p> <p>After four months, she received an email with three photos of the girl taken on the day police found her, in which her face was visible. Guerrera did not want to share the images of the semi-nude child, and looked around for an artist to sketch a portrait of the girl’s face. A forensic artist got in touch and offered to do the job. Guerrera published the picture on social media, soon attracting the interest of the press, who also shared the girl’s portrait, along with the story of the woman who wouldn’t give up looking for her.</p> <p>A few days later, the girl’s aunt, who had seen the picture making the rounds, contacted Guerrera and confirmed that the girl was her niece, Guadalupe Medina Pichardo, or Lupita to her family. She hadn’t heard any news of her for months. Then a few weeks later, a man phoned Guerrera. He introduced himself as a neighbour of Lupita’s, and said he’d tried to rescue the girl, who was a victim of heinous abuse. Guerrera compiled all the evidence she had been given and turned it over to the authorities. Police arrested Lupita’s mother and her boyfriend – Lupita’s killer – and in 2019, the pair were sentenced to <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-49603207"" title="""">88 years</a> in prison.</p> <p>Guerrera grew famous, and her combative manner attracted plenty of press attention. On 14 February 2020, she confronted President Andrés Manuel López Obrador at a press conference, taking the floor to accuse him of doing nothing to tackle femicide, which she called a “national emergency”. Amlo, as the president is known, has previously attributed the rising number of murdered women to past “neoliberal policies” and a “moral breakdown” in the country that could be solved by promoting “moral regeneration”. He has also repeatedly suggested that women speaking out about femicide are funded by his conservative political enemies who wish to discredit his administration.</p> <p>After Guerrera’s public spat with the president, Amlo’s most vocal supporters lobbed insults and death threats at her on social media, and also accused her of being financed by the political opposition. She stuck to her Twitter mission statement: “I don’t profit and I don’t lie.” She told me she lives off a meagre state stipend, which the Mexican government pays to certain journalists who face considerable danger. Jan-Albert Hootsen, the Mexico representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists, told me the accusations against Guerrera are almost certainly unfounded. It was a familiar smear, regularly used against any journalists and human rights activists. “The López Obrador government has been extremely hostile towards journalists and human rights defenders who have been critical of the government’s activities,” said Hootsen.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""dfec2fd8564063fd6718bd4083d42fa21e2bb976""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/dfec2fd8564063fd6718bd4083d42fa21e2bb976/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg"" alt=""Frida Guerrera at a press conference with Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador at the National Palace in Mexico City, February 2020"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Frida Guerrera at a press conference with Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador at the National Palace in Mexico City, February 2020.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other journalists are more dismissive of Guerrera. “She’s not a journalist. She’s an activist,” says Monserrat Ortiz, a reporter with Reporte Indigo who has covered femicide cases. “She loves to create a media circus.” Ortiz’s criticisms went further. Late last year, she published an exposé accusing Guerrera of exploiting the families of victims she purports to assist, by barring them from speaking to other journalists and occasionally posting stories to her blog without families’ consent. I’d heard similar criticisms from several journalists who hesitated to go on the record, and experienced some of this myself: after giving me several interviews for this story, Guerrera grew terse and ultimately uncommunicative when I asked to speak with some of the families she’s worked with. To her supporters, this is a sign of Guerrera trying to protect vulnerable and mourning families from an industry which, historically, has not been on their side. To her critics, it suggests that Guerrera does not want to share the limelight.</p> <p>Lucía Lagunes Huerta, who has founded multiple organisations aimed at protecting female journalists in Mexico, offered the most nuanced view, saying simply: “For some victims, she does good work.”</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On 20 November 2019, three weeks after Jessi Jaramillo’s body was carried out of Óscar García’s house, Guerrera received a Facebook friend request from “Alexander Anderson”, the account she suspected was García’s. Along with the request was a message claiming to reveal when the three women found in García’s house had been murdered and where their bodies had been stashed, and describing the house’s interior. It also mentioned a black notebook containing five names and five dates – a list of the people he had murdered. It was missing one name: “I ran out of time and I couldn’t put down Jessica. How do I know this? I’m Óscar,” the message read, in all caps. “Do I have your attention now?”</p> <p>Guerrera immediately showed the message to the commander in charge of Jessi’s case, who confirmed to her that the message’s description matched the inside of García’s house and told her to reply. “What do you want?” she messaged García. García said he wanted to know how his pets were doing. He was concerned about his cat, Paz, and his dogs, three large mutts named Gronda, Petra and Demona, all of which he’d left behind in Villas Santín. If she checked up on his pets and sent him pictures, he told Guerrera, he would give her information on his murders.</p> <p>Guerrera “was one of the links we had with [Óscar] at that time, and she seemed to have successfully established an empathetic line of communication with him,” the state of Mexico’s prosecutor’s office confirmed to me in a written statement. “His pets were really the only thing he cared about.”</p> <p>There was just one problem: the police had shot Gronda dead on the night of the search. If García found out, it seemed possible that he might stop talking, or worse. The strategy Guerrera and the authorities came up with largely consisted in her stalling for time – keeping García interested in talking to her while the police attempted to track him down by trying to locate his mobile phone, IP address, or any other method.</p> <p>For the next three weeks, Guerrera hardly ate or slept. She felt she had to answer García immediately whenever he got in touch, which he did nearly every day. He was by turns joking and arrogant, lauding his “superior intelligence” and the police’s ineptitude, then furious and impatient for news of his pets. He often launched into tirades about how much he hated his mother.</p> <p>“There were times I wanted to scream at him,” Guerrera told me. “I would speak to him harshly, tell him, ‘You sound like an idiot. Why don’t you behave like what you are? You’re a man. You’re a killer. So behave like one.’” Guerrera ran on instinct: she would let him talk, playing to his ego, then switch gears and scold him, matching his all-caps tirades with her own, as if it were a screaming match between a mother and her teenage son.</p> <p>After a few days, García’s messages grew bolder. He boasted about his supposed skills with women and mocked their stupidity for falling for him. “Are you in love with me yet?” he taunted Guerrera. He referred to the women he claimed to have murdered as <em>mis perras</em> – “my bitches” – and told Guerrera he’d make her his bitch, too. “Why do you defend those whores?” she said he asked her. “You should defend animals. They’re loyal.”</p> <p>As García opened up, he told her he’d always wanted to be a serial killer, like kids dream of becoming basketball players or president. He said his first victim had been his father, when he was 16. He also mentioned two other names: Mónica and Tomas. If García claimed to have killed six people, as he said in his first Facebook message, then these could be the other three. But with no other details besides their first names, Guerrera had little way of finding out who Mónica and Tomas were. She pressed him for details, but he offered nothing more.</p> <p>Holding up her end of the bargain, Guerrera started tracking down García’s pets. The authorities had separated them in different shelters around the area. She found Paz, the cat, first. When I asked Guerrera how she felt shooting cat videos for someone who claimed to be a killer, she shrugged. “The animals were blameless,” she said.</p> <p>She was in the middle of filming Paz when a storm of Facebook notifications erupted on her phone. García was sending her furious messages about his pets’ supposed mistreatment. It turned out the prosecutor’s office had just sent García pictures of his pets in cages on the night of the house search. (When I asked them about it, officials confirmed they sent the pictures “at an appointed time”.)</p> <p>García swore he would seek revenge, and threatened to kill another woman. He said he’d already chosen his next victim. Guerrera tried to calm him down. She told him that she was with Paz at that very moment, and begged him not to do anything rash. She sent the cat video. But he didn’t see it. He had already logged off.</p> <p>García was silent for two days. When he got back in touch, Guerrera says he told her he had killed a woman. Then he thanked her for the cat video.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>While Guerrera was messaging García, an unprecedented feminist uprising was sweeping the country. In August 2019, the alleged rape of a young woman by four police officers in Mexico City sparked what became known as the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/26/desperation-and-rage-mexican-women-take-to-streets-to-protest-unabated-sexual-violence-glitter-revolution"" title="""">Glitter Revolution</a>, so called because protesters doused the capital’s security chief with pink glitter during a demonstration. Three months later, thousands of Mexican women occupied Mexico City’s central Zócalo Square, where the presidential palace is located, and chanted “<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/03/the-rapist-is-you-chilean-protest-song-chanted-around-the-world-un-iolador-en-tu-camino"" title="""">The rapist is you</a>”. Then, in September 2020, an alliance of mothers of victims and young anarchists stormed Mexico City’s Human Rights Commission to convert it into a women’s shelter. They have occupied the building ever since.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""61c32cbc65bd7c216c4876cb522f0bcbfc85e264""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/61c32cbc65bd7c216c4876cb522f0bcbfc85e264/0_194_3500_2101/1000.jpg"" alt=""A protest against femicide and violence against women in Mexico City, November 2019"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A protest against femicide and violence against women in Mexico City, November 2019.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Carlos Jasso/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paradoxically, even when women’s killers are caught and prosecuted, the category of femicide has made it harder to convict them. “When you have a homicide, the only thing police need to prove is, ‘A murdered B’. But when you have a femicide, they need to prove that, ‘A murdered B because of C’,” says Ana Pecova, director of the women’s rights organisation Equis. A recent <a href=""https://contralacorrupcion.mx/feminicidas-libres/"" title="""">investigation</a> by the NGO Mexicans Against Corruption found that out of 15,000 violent deaths of women between 2012 and 2018, only 3,056 were investigated as femicide cases, even though they identified an additional 2,700 as fitting the criteria. And out of those, only 739 men were ultimately sentenced.</p> <p>For the families of victims, the state’s mix of apathy, incompetence and misogyny is devastating. “I felt so powerless,” Marta Leticia Gonzalez, a Mexico City resident whose 26-year-old daughter Iocelyn went missing in November 2019, told me. “I could see the authorities weren’t doing anything. I could see they don’t look for women.” After the case was passed around from investigator to investigator, Gonzalez’s daughter’s severed head was discovered and her identity confirmed by a DNA test in late December. A few weeks later, Gonzalez was sent a piece of her skin and her hair to bury. She spent the next few months requesting the rest of her daughter’s skull. They sent it to her in April 2020, and she was finally able to properly bury her daughter. The case into Iocelyn’s murder has stalled. No arrests have been made.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Two weeks after Guerrera first started talking to García, she redoubled her efforts to find out more about Mónica and Tomas, the two other people he claimed to have murdered. But García wouldn’t talk. He insisted on seeing pictures of his other pets, especially Gronda, his favourite. Guerrera started panicking. There was no way she could admit the dog had been shot and killed. She tried to buy time by sending pictures of the other animals. She told him Gronda missed him so much she wouldn’t eat and had fallen sick, and that was why she couldn’t take her picture. She couldn’t tell if he bought it.</p> <p>García asked Guerrera to make another deal with him. If Guerrera would take his pets home with her and care for them as her own, he would turn himself in. Once she accepted, he finally agreed to tell her who Mónica and Tomas were, and asked Guerrera for her email. On 2 December, she received a message with a Word document attached, in which García claimed to detail how he had murdered Mónica Chávez, a former classmate, in 2012. Mónica had ignored him, he wrote. So he had slipped into her house to kill her, but ran into her father, Tomas, instead. He killed him first, stabbing him with a knife, he said. When Mónica returned home later, he said that he had kidnapped her, taken her to Villas Santín and kept her alive for 17 days before murdering her. He later tossed her body in a ditch.</p> <p>By 5 December 2019, García had been on the run for 38 days. At 2.45pm, he wrote to Guerrera on Google Hangouts, asking her if she’d received his email. It was the last message he would ever send her. Guerrera, who was in a meeting, didn’t check her phone until 3.30pm. By then, García was in police custody.</p> <p>He had been eating a sandwich near the National Polytechnic Institute at the northern tip of Mexico City when police surrounded him. (The prosecutor’s office did not disclose how, exactly, they located him.) García put up a fight and threatened to eat a piece of poison-laced candy he carried in his pocket. He didn’t have time. The police were on him. In a <a href=""https://twitter.com/mileniotv/status/1203153366542667777"" title="""">video</a> from the local press, you can see García being led away by a patrol tightly surrounding him. With his black outfit and crew cut, he is nearly indistinguishable from the men arresting him.</p> <p>Guerrera regrets not having been there. “I wanted to see his face and tell him, ‘Your dog’s dead’,” she told me, and for the first time since we’d started speaking, laughed.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the days following García’s arrest, Guerrera met with the families of the other women García claimed to have murdered: Martha Patricia Nava Sotelo, Adriana González Hernández and Mónica Chávez. They all told crushingly similar stories of their daughters disappearing, suspecting García and telling the authorities as much, and getting ignored, rebuffed.</p> <p>Martha Patricia’s brother, Giovanni, told me that from the very start he had suspected García was behind his sister’s disappearance. García would occasionally drop by their neighbourhood to see his mother, who was Giovanni and Martha Patricia’s mother’s neighbour. He would shout, “Paty, I love you!” whenever Martha Patricia walked by. When she went missing on 9 February 2019, Giovanni says he traced her phone to García’s house in Villas Santín – just as the Jaramillos would eight months later.</p> <p>When Giovanni told the police that he believed his sister was being held captive by García, the police replied that they needed a search warrant first. Months passed, and no warrant was ever issued. Like the Jaramillos, Giovanni investigated on his own. All the time and effort he put into trying to find his sister and bringing García to justice cost him his job as a baker, plunging his young family – he has two children – into financial precarity.</p> <p>Then, eight months after his sister had gone missing, Giovanni got a call from the prosecutor’s office saying they had found her body buried in the back of García’s house. “If they’d listened to me,” Giovanni told me, “Óscar would be in prison and Jessica Jaramillo’s life would have been saved.”</p> <p>Documents shared with me confirm that García was on Mexico State authorities’ radar before Jessica Jaramillo went missing. A description of the evidence supporting the search warrant includes the statement, “Óscar García Guzmán is connected to the disappearances of two women by the names of Adriana González Hernández and Martha Patricia Nava Sotelo.”</p> <p>“This is the worst part of all this,” Guerrera told me. “Óscar García Guzmán’s name was known by the authorities since 2012.” She claimed that Mónica’s mother had told police back then that she suspected García in her daughter’s disappearance.</p> <p>At present, Jessica Jaramillo’s femicide case is making its slow way through the courts. To this day, Guerrera does not know if García was telling the truth when he claimed he had killed another woman, a seventh victim, after Jessi. In a public Facebook post before he was caught, García promised to “continue killing women for the mistreatment my pets suffered from the authorities”. He added that it was the authorities’ “mistakes” that had allowed him to get away with six murders already. “And that’s why I love MEXICO,” he wrote.</p> <p>As she waits for the verdict in García’s case, Guerrera continues to update her spreadsheet and blog, those grim testaments to sexism and violence in Mexico. On 12 February, she wrote that the body of an unidentified woman between 25 and 30 years old, with multiple stab wounds, was found in a drainpipe off a highway in Chihuahua. Earlier that same day, she logged the death of a 12-year-old girl, who’d been shot in Michoacán. She tweets it all. She still attracts criticism. She knows it. “They’ve called me crazy,” she <a href=""https://twitter.com/Fridaguerrera/status/1355578781566726148"" title="""">wrote</a> on 31 January. “Friends, partners, exes, strangers. It’s their absurd way of discrediting the truth. We’re crazy because we don’t shut up and it’s easier to call us unhinged.” </p> <p>• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=""https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread"" title="""">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email"" title="""">here</a>.",False,pillar/news,News,"['honor killing', 'women killed over honor']"

As a result, sport has been a cause of pain, fear, and distress for far too many Japanese children.</p> <p>“Athletes interviewed by Human Rights Watch described a culture of impunity for abusive coaches. Of recent child athlete interviewees who experienced abuse, all but one reported that there were no known consequences for the coach.”</p> <p>According to the report, in 2012 a 17-year-old high school basketball player in Osaka took his own life after suffering repeated physical abuse at the hands of his coach. Months later, the head coach of the Japanese Olympic women’s judo team resigned amid accusations that he had physically abused athletes in the lead-up to the 2012 London Olympics.</p> <p>Those cases and Japan’s bid for the 2020 Games led to the introduction of several reforms aiming to root out a practice that is known as <em>taibatsu</em> in Japanese, with the declaration on the elimination of violence in sport in 2013 urging organisations to track athlete abuse and establish reporting systems for victims. Human Rights Watch researchers tried to discern the reporting systems of various sports organisations and the national federations and in the report concluded they are “inaccessible.” It is understood that HRW wrote to many sports federations in Japan to ask them to report their process and data on abuse investigations, and that with few exceptions the federations declined to respond.</p> <p>“In order to end abuse of child athletes in Japan, the country will need a unified approach, guided by clear mandates and standards,” adds the report. “As a start, the government should explicitly ban any form of abuse as a coaching technique in sport, and establish a Japan Center for Safe Sport, an independent body tasked solely with addressing child abuse in sport. This body should have the responsibility to create and maintain standards for child athlete protection, and should serve as the central administrative authority for investigating abuse claims and issuing proportionate sanctions against abusive coaches. Abuse cases involving criminal behaviour should also be referred to police and prosecutors for concurrent criminal investigation.”</p> <p>There have been other cases of suicide since 2018, with the 17-year old Tsubasa Araya leaving a note that read “volleyball is the hardest” after he had allegedly been verbally and physically abused by his coach. The report also explained how last year a 15-year-old junior high school table tennis player in Ibaraki prefecture took her own life, writing in a note she left behind that her coach had constantly threatened to “punch” or “to kill” her. With the 2020 Games delayed for a year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, HRW has called on Japan to take “decisive action”.</p> <p>“Japan has a unique opportunity to show the world how it cares for its child athletes, and to lead in making sport safe for all,” says the report. “In doing so, Japan, as a pathfinding country of the UN Global Partnership to End Violence, would honour its commitment to ending violence against children. Taking decisive action to protect child athletes will send a message to Japan’s children that their health and well-being matter, place abusive coaches on notice that their behaviour will no longer be tolerated, and serve as a model for how other countries should end child abuse in sport.”</p> <p>The International Olympic Committee said in a statement: “We acknowledge the Human Rights Watch report entitled ‘I was hit so many times I can’t count’ – abuse of child athletes in Japan. Harassment and abuse is unfortunately part of society and also occurs within sport. The IOC stands together with all athletes, everywhere, to state that abuse of any kind is contrary to the values of Olympism, which calls for respect for everyone in sport. All members of society are equal in their right to respect and dignity, just as all athletes have the right to a safe sporting environment – one that is fair, equitable and free from all forms of harassment and abuse.”</p> <p><em>Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.</em><em> In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.
