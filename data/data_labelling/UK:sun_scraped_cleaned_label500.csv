The 19-year-old, now facing a year behind bars after being found guilty of making up claims she was raped by 12 young Israelis, says Cypriot police coerced her into a confession after a bungled investigation.

The teen's mum appeared on today's This Morning programme to talk about her daughter's case before she is due to be sentenced before a Cypriot judge tomorrow.

Her mother claims that a police officer told the court in a previous hearing that he never took any notes down on the night of the incident because he was 'too busy'.

She went onto slam Cypriot law as 'wrong' and a 'disgrace' adding that there were many 'shortcomings' throughout the police investigation.

She told hosts Holly and Phil via video link from Cyrpus that the only evidence police had was the retracement statement which they had failed to record.

The statement has been disputed by experts who say that it could not have been written by a native English speaker.

The Brit could face up to a year in jail when sentenced tomorrow but could otherwise be handed a suspended sentence alongside a fine.

The young woman's mother was also asked if her daughter would accept a pardon from the Cypriot president.

She said: ""Of course in the event she was put into prison, to get out of prison, she would accept a pardon.

""Provided, that would be subject to her not admitting guilt. She is innocent. She was brutally and violently raped by a group of men.

""She will never say she is guilty of this offense.""

DAUGHTER'S INNOCENCE

She supported her daughter saying she had 'no doubt' that she was innocent but was worried that her mental health had since been declining on a daily basis.

The student, who hopes to one day become a police officer, is suffering from PTSD and hypersomnia, as her mother claims she has been sleeping for up to 20 hours a day.

She also explained how she was commuting to work when her daughter called to say she had been gang-raped.

She said: ""I was thankful, I say this, on a train because quite honestly if I would have been driving a car, I would have crashed it.

""She said, 'Mum, I'm at a police station, I have been raped by a group of boys.

""It was horrendous, it was the worst thing.

""I was shaking, I felt numb, I felt physically sick. It was honestly the worst thing I've ever heard.""

10 Protests were also carried out in London to show support for the young woman

The British teenager has had a huge amount of support from both British and Israeli activists who say that women's voices are not being heard in cases such as these.

Her mother thanked the girl's family and friends as well as those who have donated to the Go Fund Me page, which has now raised £135,000, and warned others to look at this case before travelling to Ayia Napa.

Talking about comments left online for her daughter, she said: ""We read through those, I sit with her on a daily basis, we read through those.

""They are so inspiring they are so motivating, so thank you to anyone that has contributed in any way.""



'POSSIBILITY SHE HAD BEEN DRUGGED'

Dr Marios Matsakis, 65, a forensic pathologist, claims the lines of inquiry into the case were not properly investigated, the Mirror reports.

He said:“It’s a possibility she had been drugged. It is another aspect that was not fully explored.”

The woman, from Derbyshire, wanted to be a police officer and had offers from five universities to study criminology and policing.

Her mother told The Times: ""She had in mind to be a police officer but she would not be accepted as she wouldn’t have ‘good faith’ if she had to give evidence in court. ""

She said her daughter was initially named on Twitter and fears she will never be able to escape the ordeal.

She added: “She sees it as a life sentence — it will always be online. She feels powerless . . . it is like she is being made to go through everything again.”

The teen has faced a traumatic ordeal since first reporting the alleged gang rape.

After telling police of the incident she later retracted her statement under questioning, with cops then claiming she concocted the story after learning video of her having consensual sex was posted online.

One of the men accused of raping the teen has vowed to sue her, sparking fury amongst counsellors and campaigners.

Yona Golub, 18, insists the 19-year-old student ""deserves to go to jail"" because his life has turned upside down since the rape allegation.

ISRAELI PROTESTS

A group of around 60 Israeli women have said they will protest in support of the British teenager outside the courthouse, on Tuesday.

The demonstrators insist that the young woman is a victim of a gross miscarriage of justice and say they will stand beside her to help overturn her conviction.

Academic Ruhama Weiss, who runs the group, told the Telegraph: ""“This case has become a huge issue in Israel. Instead of trying to help the victim, she is being judged and punished. For us, that is intolerable. As Israelis, we want to say that this is not acceptable.

""Just because the boys involved are Israelis and Jews does not mean we should automatically defend them. People in Israel really care about this case and it is all over the media.

""The people who will take part in the protest are from all different occupations, different ages, many are women but there will also be some men. It was very spontaneous. I had the idea of demonstrating and people immediately started calling me.""

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also raised concerns about the Brits treatment but added that the government did not want 'aggravate' Cypriots ahead on Tuesday's sentencing.

The 30-year-old, who had an affair with co-star Sam Ball, said the backlash she endured as her season first aired in Australia in 2019 left her suicidal with her weight plummeting to 41kg.

8 Married At First Sight’s Ines says she was 'suicidal' and ‘so thin she thought she’d die’ after the show

She tells The Sun: “It was real hard. The whole thing… my weight loss was so severe. I dropped down to 41kg (6st 6lb) from 56kg (8st 11lb).

""I was too scared, people were sending me rape and death threats every day.

""I was too stressed to eat and couldn’t stomach anything while it was airing. Once it stopped airing I slowly started getting better.""

Ines' mental health first started to deteriorate during filming, after witnessing somebody attempt to take their own life and then finding out that a close friend had suddenly died.

“I saw someone jump of a balcony [while we were filming on the Gold Coast]. I’d just finished filming at 3am and was a witness and had to call the police. I was screaming and I couldn’t stand up. They survived,” Ines continued.

“Then I had a friend die during filming and [producers] let me have one day off. The show got me a psychiatrist and I was diagnosed with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder).”

After leaving MAFS, Ines then spent three months recovering at home – but things got drastically worse as she was then required to film the show's reunion episode, before it then started airing on TV.

She admits to “over-medicating on valium” while filming the end-of-season reunion - and has no recollection of being there.

Ines added: “There was so much happening and slamming me at once and I was so f***ed. It all happened within a short amount of time and I thought I was going to die. I got so thin I thought I’d die.

“I was suicidal. I was taking valium for my anxiety. I over-medicated before the reunion and shouldn’t have drank. I don’t even remember being there.”

David Cameron, 47, suffered a head injury when he fell to the ground after being struck once on the side of his face in Consett, County Durham, on December 5 2019.

An inquest at Crook Coroner's Court heard he suffered a heart attack and a ""substantial head injury"" after the altercation on Southernwood Road at around 5.30pm.

Mr Cameron, a bus driver, was walking home from the pub with his stepdaughter Abbey when the pair passed a group of teen boys, Chronicle Live reports.

A row broke out between him and a 14-year-old and Mr Cameron allegedly pushed the boy before the boy punched him and he fell to the ground.

The inquest heard how neighbours, including Mr Cameron's wife Carol, rushed out of their homes to perform CPR in an attempt to save his life.

A statement read out in court by Senior Assistant Coroner Crispin Oliver said: ""The female in the black coat I later found out to be the wife of the man in the road. She said someone had punched him and he had fallen over.

I felt as if I needed to stop him and I just seen the man trip up the kerb and push my friend. He punches him and he dropped. Eye witness

""When David was on his back it was clear he wasn't breathing. David's wife and my son worked together performing CPR.""

But despite the efforts of nurse Carol and the emergency services, Mr Cameron was pronounced dead.

One eye witness, who was 14 at the time and cannot be named for legal reasons, said they helped walk Mr Cameron part of the way home with his stepdaughter.

In an interview after the incident, they told police: ""We were walking along, we seen a man with his stepdaughter.

""The man fell, he got back up and we passed him, and I heard the stepdaughter shout ‘excuse me can you help’.

""I stopped, turned around and helped the man. I had my arm around and helped him.

""The man was quite drunk. He was struggling to walk and his daughter had her arm around him helping him to walk.

""My friend told us to hurry up, I thought he needed help so I turned around.

""The man was telling my friend to 'shut up and f off'. He seemed angry and wanted to go home.

""He let go of me and the woman and he just walked towards my friend saying 'come on then’.

""His stepdaughter was telling him to stop. Then my friend kept annoying the man so the man just pushed us out the way and was going towards him.

""I felt as if I needed to stop him and I just seen the man trip up the kerb and push my friend. He punches him and he dropped.""

'JUST ONE HIT'

In earlier evidence given to the inquest, stepdaughter Abbey said Mr Cameron hadn't deliberately pushed anyone before he was punched.

But the witness told Senior Assistant Coroner Mr Oliver that ""there was definitely a push"".

They added: ""It could have been a possibility that he might have stumbled but I seen his hands go up and my friend getting pushed back.""

The witness also told police that Mr Cameron was hit in the face with ""quite some force"".

They added: ""My friend just hits him. One hit. The next thing I know the man’s fallen.

""I heard the woman screaming ‘David’ and she started shouting his name. She was scared, she didn’t know what was happening.

""My friend said he seen the eyes go back and he was scared.""

The witness told police the group ran away from the scene before neighbours and emergency services arrived, but that they were left shaken by the incident.

When learning of Mr Cameron’s death, the witness said “our jaws just dropped”.

They told police: “I feel like a horrible person, I shouldn’t have been there in the first place.

""The man looked like he was angry, but I don’t think he would have been able to hurt my friend because of how drunk he was.

""I don't think there was any need for him to hit the man. He could have just walked off and he would have not been able to hurt him.""

One of the teens was arrested on suspicion of murder but was later released.

In May 2020, Durham Constabulary released a statement which said: ""A teenager who was arrested in connection with the tragic death of a Consett man has been released with no further action.

The horrific incident occurred at the family’s house in the city of Vologda, in the north-west of the country, two weeks after the couple’s wedding.

Kapustin had presented himself as a caring partner but began drinking heavily days after tying the knot, a court was told.

After getting fed up with his drinking, Marina started ignoring him.

A video shows Kapustin saying to detectives: “I came home and she didn’t say hello to me. I got angry. Went to the kitchen and took the biggest knife.”

Kapustin, who reportedly was drunk at the time, is said to have attacked Marina with the weapon in front of little Nikol.

The man hit his wife with the knife seven times and then attacked the child, who had rushed to her mother and shielded her with her body, investigators said.

Kapustin stabbed the girl 18 times before dousing both victims with petrol and setting them alight along with their home while trying to destroy evidence.

Police spokeswoman Natalia Letenkova said: “Examinations showed the victims died from multiple stab wounds to the upper body. The woman was pregnant at the moment of the crime.

“Forensics also said the girl was still alive when the suspect set the house on fire.”

Kapustin confessed to killing the mother and the child during police interrogations, local media report.

Marina Kapustina’s grieving father Mikhail Maklakov said to local media: “I lost my daughter and granddaughter.

“In the whole world, I loved them the most. Now I don't know what to live for.”

He faces up life-sentence in prison if convicted of murder committed with particular cruelty. The trial continues.

The woman, 19, boarded a flight back to the UK yesterday after a judge gave her a suspended jail term for “public mischief”.

But despite being given a suspended sentence, the teen has vowed to clear her name with the help of a team of legal experts.

Lawyers now have just ten days to submit an appeal to the Supreme Court of Cyprus and will then wait to see if it has been accepted by a tribunal

A specialist in human rights and part of the teen's defence, Nicoletta Charalambidou, told the Sun Online: ""We are preparing to submit an expedited appeal request so that it can be heard within six months.

""We have ten days from the day of sentencing, but will likely use all of them to prepare the ground properly.""

After landing back in the UK the young woman was overcome with emotion and told The Sun how she was desperate to enjoy England’s “cold weather”, tuck into a “cheeky Nando’s” and go for walks with her pet dog again.

The woman, who insists she is innocent, vowed: “My fight goes on”.

She and her mother boarded a BA jet from Larnaca to London after two passengers gave up their seats for 550 euros, following an appeal for volunteers by airline staff.

In an exclusive interview, she said: “I really thought it would be a custodial sentence when I arrived at court. When the translator said four months, I thought I was going to jail.

“It was only when she said suspended that I realised I was actually finally going home. I looked at my mum and we both had tears in our eyes. I’m so delighted to be going home.”

The teen voiced appreciation to hundreds of donors to her legal fund — many of them loyal Sun readers.

She added: “I want to thank everyone who has supported me. I am innocent and the fight will go on to clear my name.

'A NIGHTMARE'

“It’s been a nightmare for me, mum and everyone. Now I just want to be with my friends and family.

“What kept me going was my family and the amazing support of my friends and all other people who got in contact to say they believed me.

“Now, at last, I can go home to my own bed. I’m even looking forward to the cold weather back in England!

“I can’t wait to have a cheeky Nando’s and to take my dog for a long walk through the countryside.”

The teenager, who has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, was forced to spend nearly five weeks in prison on remand in a cell with up to nine other women.

Even after being granted bail in August, she was kept under virtual house arrest in a villa in the holiday resort of Ayia Napa and had her passport seized.

Her lawyers have already begun work on the appeal. Judge Michalis Papathanasiou suspended her jail term for three years, and ordered her to pay £125 court fees.

He told her he was giving her a “second chance” after last week convicting her despite huge holes in the prosecution’s case.

'VERY AGGRESSIVE'

The judge sparked fury by insisting “all the evidence shows that she had lied”. He dismissed expert defence witnesses as “unreliable” while ruling all prosecution ones “credible”.

Prosecutors also tried to pass off injuries to the woman — said to have been caused when she was held down by her attackers — as “jellyfish stings”.

She told The Sun: “I felt the judge was very aggressive towards me and vindictive. He was misogynistic towards me and my female defence team. They were barely allowed to ask questions and yet the prosecutor had me on the stand for six hours.”

Well-wishers chanted outside the court yesterday and held signs saying, “We Believe You”.

Her ordeal began last summer after she flew to Ayia Napa for a working holiday before university. On July 17 — in floods of tears — she and a pal rushed to tell cops she had been gang-raped by a group of Israelis. Police arrested the 12 suspects aged 16 to 19, but later released them.

Cops then accused her of making up the claims. She was quizzed for eight hours without a lawyer before being ordered to sign a dictated statement retracting her allegations.

Last night the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “The Foreign Office will be working with Cyprus and other countries on how we can avoid cases like this happening again.

“We have had numerous concerns about the judicial process in this case.

Sir Michael Wilshaw banned hugs in his school while working as a headteacher in 2007, saying the decision was viewed as ""too strict"" at the time.

But the former Chief Inspector of Schools in England today insisted it was ""the right thing to do"" as schools across the country face a Whitehall investigation into the harrowing scale of misogyny, harassment and sexual assault in and around classrooms.

Speaking of his time as the head of Mossbourne Academy in Hackney, London, Sir Michael told Good Morning Britain: “It was seen as the norm for boys when they came into the school to hug girls - there was nothing malicious in it, but they saw that as the norm but of course some over stepped the mark.

""Once I got complaints from girls that some boys were overstepping the mark I banned it.""

He said the decision came ""at great cost to the school and myself"" adding ""I was seen as being far too strict and far too authoritarian on this one"".

""But looking back now it was absolutely the right thing to do.""

Of schoolkids knowing their boundaries, Sir Michael said: ""They’ve got to know where the delineating lines are. It’s crucial for headteachers to make clear what is acceptable behaviour towards girls and what is not.”

He added: ""Unless head teachers and senior staff set the tone, set the culture, have high expectations, clearly define the parameters for poor behaviour than these sort of things happen.”

SCHOOL SCANDAL

Sir Michael's comments come amid an emerging ""rape culture"" scandal in Britain's schools, with thousands of pupils coming forward to share their experiences.

Whitehall is probing the issue as police ramp up efforts to tackle gender based violence, after a website 'Everyone's Invited' shone a ""light on peer-on-peer abuse within educational settings across the UK.""

Simon Bailey, the National Police Chiefs Council's lead for child abuse and investigation said: ""Thousands of children and young people have come forward to report allegations of sexual offences within schools"".

He added: ""We will now work at pace with Everyone's Invited and partners, including the Home Office and Department for Education, to progress a joint response.

A placard saying 'End Rape Culture' attached to the fence outside James Allen's Girls' School

""If victims wish to report sexual abuse to the police, they can be confident that they will be believed and treated with compassion and respect before a thorough investigation is undertaken.""

Officials from the Department of Education and Home Office are leading the response along with police chiefs and Ofsted.

And inspectors from Ofsted and the Independent Schools Inspectorate are ready to launch surprise investigations in schools if safety concerns are raised, Whitehall sources told the Telegraph.

Government advice on sexual harassment and sexual violence between kids in schools and colleges is also being revised and will be in force by the beginning of the next academic year, the Telegraph reports.

Sources confirmed that officials from the Government and ministers will be meeting in the coming weeks.

""We take all allegations and concerns about sexual abuse or violence extremely seriously and are working with multi-agency safeguarding partners to ensure the safety of all children in all schools, including in independent schools,"" the source added.

""Where schools do not meet the strict safeguarding standards that we have in place, we will always take action.

""If it becomes clear that there are current failings in any school's safeguarding practice, we will immediately ask Ofsted or the Independent Schools Inspectorate to conduct an inspection.

The falling out has blown up even further after serious allegations against several of the group's members. Here is everything you need to know about their feud.

What is the feud between Trisha Paytas and Jeff Wittek?

The drama between Trisha Paytas and Jeff Wittek began after Trisha mentioned in a YouTube video how one of her ex-boyfriend Jason Nash's friends ignored her in a Starbucks.

Jeff later confirmed it was him and she was furious at his description of the encounter.

He said in a podcast: ""I don't have any respect for them. If somebody f**ks over one of my friends, I don't even make eye contact with them.

""I'm not going to see you out and be like, 'Oh hey, how are you doing?' just to avoid that little awkward moment.""

Trisha hit back and said Jeff ""misconstrued the whole Starbucks thing"" - but this was just the beginning.

She went on to claim the Vlog Squad, whose channel has almost 19million subscribers, ""ruined her life"", adding: ""Your f*****g friends are the reason I was in a f*****g mental hospital.""

Then this month, an explosive article published by Business Insider reported that a woman featured on the Vlog Squad channel was raped by former member Durte Dom in 2018.

Jeff was dragged into the controversy after it was alleged he bought alcohol for underage girls the same night of the alleged sexual assault.

He denies the allegations, but photos show he was there while the victim was carried out of the apartment.

And her friend told Insider she recalls Jeff going out to buy alcohol that same night.

What has Jeff Wittek said about the allegations?

In a video titled My Truth, Jeff claims the only person who accused him of buying alcohol for minors was Trisha.

He added: ""It just makes me angry because it is so not true.

""Trisha and I haven’t been so friendly with each other in the past because of the breakup with Jason [Nash].""

Jeff has said he has donated money to a charity that helps victims of sexual assault, adding that what Dom did was ""horrible and disgusting"".

He went on to say he had ""absolutely nothing to do"" with the events that night.

What's the latest on the feud?

After Jeff's video, Trisha invited him to join her and YouTuber Ethan Klein on their Frenemies podcast.

They questioned whether Jeff had read the article about him - and he admitted he had not.

She also revealed a photo with a timestamp which proved Jeff was present at the time and played a recording which contradicted his story.

Jeff apologized directly to Trisha for his comments about her time in a mental health facility.

And Trisha, who has 1.43million YouTube subscribers, tweeted that she felt sympathy for Jeff at the moment as he is ""going through some stuff"".

She added that ""he is not slimy like the rest of the group, just trying to cover his bros"".

We met while working at the same DIY store last year. He’s 24, I’m 27.

1 I have been sleeping with my lover for six months but he has a girlfriend, I don't know how to make him commit to me

Everyone knew he lived with his partner, but that didn’t stop him from flirting — he’d regularly find an excuse to come and talk, quizzing me on whether I was single.

It got more intense as the months went on, with him regularly swapping shifts so we could spend more time together.

One shift we were alone in the stock room, sorting through a delivery.

He was trying everything and anything to make me laugh — jumping out of boxes and tickling me with the paintbrushes.

We weren’t getting much done so I tried to ignore him, moving further away to unpack another box.

Next thing I know, he’s pushing me up against the wall and kissing me.

It was full of passion — as if he’d been waiting months to do that.

After our shift we didn’t even make it out of the car park and ended up having sex in the back of his car.

Six months on and we’re still sneaking around.

We’ll meet each other in the stockroom for a kiss or a fondle whenever we can. But then, at the end of his shift, it’s like I don’t exist.

He goes home to his girlfriend, and won’t text me until he’s leaving for work the next day.

I don’t know if I’m being used as a bit of fun on the side, or whether he actually has feelings for me.

When I do bring up his partner, he quickly changes the conversation, so I have no idea if he has any intention of leaving her.

I feel awful being “the other woman” and have tried to cut it off a few times, but he always pulls me back in.

DEIDRE SAYS: The only person who knows what your lover wants is him – so you need to ask.

But bear in mind that you might not get the answer you want. By not talking about his current relationship, he avoids discussing yours, and it’s likely he’s doing this because he doesn’t think you’ll like what he has to say.

Protesters have occupied the Seattle area, and barricaded it for around two weeks amid ongoing protests following the death of George Floyd.

Video shared on social media showed Seattle Police pushing through demonstrators in the autonomous zone.

Some police used pepper spray in front of the precinct, KING 5 reported.

Cops clad in increased protective gear were seen holding batons as they pushed back protesters.

As of early Wednesday morning, police said they had made around 10 arrests.

Protesters called for police to leave them alone and chanted as cops moved in.

Seattle Police Department said cops were wearing protective gear ""because individuals associated w/the CHOP are known to be armed and dangerous/may be associated with shootings, homicides, robberies, assaults &other violent crimes.""

Demonstrators have said they should not be blamed for the violence.

At 12pm yesterday, Cal Anderson Park was closed – and at 2am on Wednesday, the entire area was closed to ""restore public safety,"" an executive order from Durkan said.

Durkan noted of demonstrations in her order that ""much of the expression has been peaceful ad created community solidarity for Black Lives Matter.""

She said however, that ""conditions in the Cal Anderson Park Area have deteriorated to the point where public health, life, and safety are threatened by activities in and around this area...""

Durkan then noted a number of incidents – including shootings, reports of ""rape, robbery, assault, and increased gang activity,"" and property damage – as she ordered the occupied zone be broken up.

Police Chief Carmen Best said ""CHOP has become lawless and brutal.""

""Four shootings–-two fatal—robberies, assaults, violence and countless property crimes have occurred in this several block area,"" Best said.

The Met officer is said to have shared the vile material in a graphic with colleagues on a WhatsApp group.

Shocked colleagues reported the rookie cop to senior officers and he has been removed from duties at the site and placed on a restricted role.

A high-level internal inquiry has been launched by the Met and the matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.

The Met said tonight: ""On Friday 12 March, the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards was made aware of an inappropriate graphic that was allegedly shared via social media by a probationary MPS police constable with some colleagues.

""The sharing of the graphic was reported by a number of these officers who were concerned by its content.

""Given the context of the officer’s duties at the time, a voluntary referral has been made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct in relation to this matter.

""The PC had been deployed as a cordon officer supporting the search operation in Kent in relation to the murder of Sarah Everard.

""The officer has been removed from these duties and placed in a non-public facing role while enquiries continue.

""The graphic does not contain photographic images, no images of Sarah, nor any other material obtained from or related to the investigation into Sarah’s murder.

""Sarah’s family have been made aware of the incident.""

Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said: “The MPS expects its officers to behave professionally at all times and this includes how they use social media.

""I take allegations that any officer or officers have failed to observe these standards very seriously and have referred this matter to the IOPC.”

Police today searched a new area in Sandwich, Kent - around 30 miles from where Sarah's body was found.

Officers cordoned off a Co-op car park and a pathway close to woodland as part of the investigation.

Cops today placed a gold necklace found on top of a car park machine in an evidence bag but it is not clear if it is connected to the tragic case.

Others officers with sticks were seen searching through a shopping trolley shelter and under cars in the car park.

Meanwhile specialist police divers waded through a stream next to a pathway as the new search continues.

It comes after protesters outside Parliament blocked roads and staged a sit-in outside Scotland Yard today as they shouted: ""We will not be silenced.""

Hundreds of people gathered outside Parliament in London at 5pm for a second day of protest over violence against women.

The Metropolitan Police said in a statement: ""A number of groups have gathered in Parliament Square to demonstrate.

""Officers are engaging with those present, urging them not to gather in numbers for their own safety & to prevent the spread of Coronavirus.""

Protesters are also opposing a new bill - which is being discussed in Parliament today and tomorrow - which would give police and the home secretary greater powers to crack down on protests.

Under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, police forces would be able to impose a start and end time for demonstrations, set a noise limit and shut down protests that have a ""relevant impact on persons in the vicinity"".

It comes as the CPS consider charges against two Met cops who allegedly shared grotesque selfies on WhatsApp of the bodies of murdered sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman.

Bibaa, 46, and Nicole, 27, were stabbed to death by a maniac in Fryent Country Park, Wembley, North West London, in June last year.

They had earlier been with a group of friends at a socially-distanced birthday picnic for Bibaa.

The sisters stayed behind when the others left to listen to music and dance with fairy lights.

Their mother, The Venerable Mina Smallman, the first black archdeacon in the Church of England, said the photos taken by the officers had “dehumanised” her daughters.

She told the BBC: “If ever we needed an example of how toxic it has become, those police officers felt so safe, so untouchable, that they felt they could take photographs of dead black girls and send them on.

“It speaks volumes of the ethos that runs through the Metropolitan police.”

The IOPC is investigating six cops who allegedly received or viewed the images of the sisters but failed to report it.

As a result of the probe, the watchdog is also investigating one officer for taking a photo at the scene of a sudden death elsewhere in North London.

The chaotic scenes saw a number of arrests overnight as the protesters and more than 100 cops armed with shields and helmets faced off in the streets.

One of the detained rioters has since been issued a fixed penalty notice while the other nine remain in custody, cops said today.

Boris Johnson called the attacks against officers ""disgraceful"" giving the city and the police his ""full support.""

The Prime Minister said today: ""Last night saw disgraceful attacks against police officers in Bristol.

""Our officers should not have to face having bricks, bottles and fireworks being thrown at them by a mob intent on violence and causing damage to property.

""The police and the city have my full support.""

And the Home Secretary today shamed the 'troublesome' demonstrators, saying: ""I am disgusted by the disorder in Bristol and the violence being directed towards the police.

""I’m in no doubt the silent, law-abiding majority will be appalled by the actions of this criminal minority.

TEN ARRESTED

""Despite repeated warnings to disperse, it’s clear these thugs were only intent on causing trouble. I am receiving regular updates and the police have my full support.""

Around 1,000 people had gathered in Bristol on Friday night with fears that the scenes would descend into violence after two confrontations in the city already this week.

The protests have been sparked after a new policing bill which would see protests criminalised when deemed a ""public nuisance""

And chaos kicked off quickly yet again with fireworks sent flying towards a police horse during the scuffles as cops tried to move on the protesters.

Fears of protesters arming themselves were also sparked with reports that a group of six men had been spotted in the crowd wearing knuckledusters just years away from the police station.

And the demonstrators were heard screaming ""no"" as the dramatic scenes once again took place on the streets.

Avon and Somertset Police said projectiles including eggs and glass bottles had been lobbed at cops.

In a tweet, they said: ""We will not tolerate violent disorder. Arrests have been made.""

But activists, who had earlier staged a sit-down demonstration outside Bristol’s Bridgeway police station, retreated just metres as they refused to give up ground.

Officers warned protesters force would be used - with mounted officers on horses and dogs on standby.

The baying crowd chanted “shame on you” as they were pushed back.

Other protesters were spotted with shopping bags full of alcohol after police put a restriction on city-centre shops from selling alcohol.

Earlier police formed a ring of steel around Bridewell Police Station, which was attacked in previous carnage.

The protests have been held in Bristol over the past week, protesting against the Government's Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill.

And during Friday's demonstrations protesters could be heard chanting ""ten years for protest, five years for rape"" and ""justice for Sarah"", referring to the recent murder of Sarah Everard in London.

It comes after demonstrations on Sunday and Tuesday had also started peacefully before descending into assaults against police and acts of vandalism.

Avon and Somerset Police is currently investigating assaults on 40 officers and one member of the media by thugs at the previous demos.

A total of 24 people have so far been arrested in connection with the disorder, which saw officers attacked, police vehicles set on fire and the windows of a police station smashed.

Police had urged people not to attend any protests because public gatherings are not currently permitted under coronavirus legislation.

Superintendent Mark Runacres said: “The majority of people acted peacefully however there was a minority who once again showed hostility to officers.

“Items, including glass bottles and bricks were thrown at officers, fireworks were launched at our mounted section while one of our horses was also covered with paint.

“This violent conduct is not acceptable.

“Officers repeatedly encouraged people to disperse but once the atmosphere changed and people became physical it was necessary to take action.

“Ten people were arrested for offences including violent disorder, assaulting an emergency worker and possession of Class A drugs.

“Three of those arrested were also detained in connection with the violent disorder which took place in Bristol on Sunday.”

Supt Runacres added: “All the officers policing the incident are specially trained and accredited in public order and showed exceptional patience in the face of a significant disorder.

“At times reasonable force had to be used – this is not something we ever want to do but we have a duty to uphold the law, prevent crime, and protect people and property.”

Graphic bodycam footage of the shooting was last night released by officials.

Cops say they were called to the scene by a person who said someone was trying to stab them at 4.32pm, with officers arriving on scene minutes later at 4.44pm

Video showed two girls arguing before a cop shouted ""Get down"" and began firing his weapon multiple times at one of them – just seconds after arriving on-scene.

The white cop, who was identified as Nicholas Reardon, has been placed on administrative leave while police investigate if his actions were justified, Police Chief Michael Woods told The Columbus Dispatch.

Reardon was hired by the force in December 2019.

Hazel Bryant, who said she is Ma'khia's aunt, said her niece called police because she was being abused by someone at the foster home where she lived, The Daily Beast reported.

She told The Columbus Dispatch that her niece got into an altercation with someone else who lived at the same home.

Hazel claimed that Ma'khia had a knife – and although she dropped it, she was shot multiple times, reports The Columbus Dispatch.

""She didn’t deserve to die like a dog in the street,"" Bryant said, as reported by The Daily Beast.

Ma'khia's mom, Paula Bryant, described her daughter as a ""sweet child"" who was on the honor roll at school.

""She was a very loving, peaceful little girl,"" Paula Bryant told WBNS.

She added: ""Ma'Khia had a motherly nature about her. She promoted peace.""

""That's something that I want to always be remembered.""

Pelas - who has natural 30HH boobs - has racked up more than 8.6million followers on her Instagram page.

But the 29-year-old was left furious after one of her pictures was taken down for breaching the guidelines.

In the image, Pelas posed for the camera as she showed off her cleavage in a skimpy black top.

She covered her modesty - but Instagram decided to remove it for 'nudity or sexual activity'.

Pelas shared the snap to her Twitter page and wrote: ""This photo got removed on @Instagram I guess you can't be naked and you also can't be hot. Lmfao.""

During an interview with TMZ, Pelas accused the social media site of promoting rape culture.

She said: ""Instagram has been pretty consistently discriminating against women's businesses and women's bodies.

""It's been really particular about showing so much skin surface and the type of wardrobe.

""You can actually go and look at Instagram and Facebook policies and they show examples of what they believe to be sexually suggestive.

""One of them is a woman sitting on a bed in underwear.

""The issue is when you decide that something is sexually suggestive, instead of a woman deciding that she wants to have sex with you, it's promoting rape culture.

""You can't just say, 'Oh if she wore a mini skirt she deserves to be raped', that's rape culture.""

The ex-girlfriend of Calum Best urged the government to step in to sort out the ongoing issue.

Before she added: ""I think we are far behind on cyber legislation and our digital laws do not mirror the laws we have in place in our physical lives.

""I think it's really important that our government notices that and takes note of it.

""We have these laws that we have to live and abide by and pay taxes on in a society that we support and we live that way, but then online it's lawless and people can do whatever they want and they can cherry pick.

The victims, two 15-year-old British schoolgirls, went to a party at a villa in Marconia di Pisticci, in the province of Matera, where they were allegedly raped by eight men the night between September 7 and September 8.

The girls said shortly after they arrived at the party, they were taken to a field nearby, where they were raped for about 15 minutes by a group of men.

CCTV footage released by police showed the suspects heading towards the field and coming back shortly after, attempting to leave the villa.

Michele Masiello, 23, Alberto Lopatriello, 22, Alessandro Zuccaro, 21, and Giuseppe Gargano, 19, who were named and pictured by Italian media, were arrested and are being held in jail in Matera.

'BRUTAL ASSAULT'

Local rappers Michele Leone and Egidio Andriulli, known on YouTube as Red Michael and Meu Deus, have also been added to the register of suspects, Italian national newspaper La Repubblica reports.

It is not clear whether the two trap artists, who are being investigated, were directly involved in the attack. The newspaper says that prosecutors have named them.

In their latest song 'Conto Cash' - which translates to 'I count my cash' - they rap: ""I count money in my Mercedes, two b*****s on board, we go for a ride.""

The song continues: ""These two b*****s undo my belt.""

Witnesses who were at the party confirmed the rappers were at the villa at the time of the alleged rape.

They reportedly arrived there with the four men who were arrested and are currently in jail, according to Virgilio.

Red Michael, a rapper online and an engineer in real life, is said to be the son of a police officer.

The organiser of the party said an invitation was published on Facebook, which is why many people joined in.

He said: ""We were wrong in publishing the invite on Facebook and send it to some WhatsApp groups, but we could not have imagined [what happened].

""The party was going well until at some point I saw the boys from Pisticci arrive.

""Everyone knows them here, they are a bit degenerate, even though some of them come from good families.""

He added: ""When I saw them arrive, I wondered what they were doing here. But then they disappeared.

""When we were serving the cake, the uncle of one of the British girls arrived and started talking.

""It was only then that we understood what had happened.""

One of the victims said she had the impression one of the men was trying to film the attack on his phone.

She said: ""I told them to stop. I was shouting in English let me go.

""They took off their trousers and I tried to defend myself by biting the penis of one.

""I saw that one of them was trying to film it on his phone.''

Following the rape, the victims told the sister of one of them what happened, then they returned home and called the emergency services.

The girls were taken to Madonna della Grazie hospital in Matera for a health assessment, according to reports.

The two victims, who were in a state of shock, reported the incident to police, saying they had been punched before being raped, TGcom24 reports.

Officers described the rape as a ''brutal and extreme assault''.

The investigation revealed that the uncle of one of the girls was told by guests ''don't call the police or you will ruin the party'' when he went to the villa after the attack.

One of the girls described in her statement how she ordered a drink from a barman and was then offered a second by a man she met at the party.

She said: ''I didn't knowingly take any drugs but I think someone put something in my second drink because after I drank it I felt awful.''

It came as the Minneapolis police officer, 45, was found guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter and faces a maximum sentence of 75 years in jail.

After the verdict, the Prime Minister said he was ""appalled"" by the death of Floyd last year.

He tweeted: ""I was appalled by the death of George Floyd and welcome this verdict.

""My thoughts tonight are with George Floyd’s family and friends.""

My thoughts tonight are with George Floyd’s family and friends. Boris Johnson

Mr Johnson's tribute came as US President Joe Biden called the conviction a a ""giant step forward"" in tackling racism in the US.

He branded Floyd’s death a “stain on our nation’s soul” and called his relatives a “remarkable family of extraordinary courage”.

Biden said: “It was a murder in full light of day, and it ripped the blinders off for the whole would to the systemic racism...that's a stain on our nation's soul.”

The president added: “Nothing can ever bring their brother back. But this can be a giant step forward in the march toward justice in America.”

Chauvin knelt on Floyd’s neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds while arresting the 46-year-old trucker in May 2020, killing him after he had repeatedly yelled out: “I can’t breathe.”

He now faces a maximum 40 years in jail on the most serious charge, plus 25 years and ten years in prison on the other two.

The shamed officer, wearing a suit and face mask in court, showed no emotion as the verdicts - guilty on all counts - were read aloud by Judge Peter Cahill.

His bail was revoked and he was cuffed and led down to the cells – as cheers erupted from outside the courthouse.

At George Floyd Square, the memorial where Floyd was killed, a woman nearly collapsed in tears, crying out: “We matter. We matter.”

Chants of ""justice"" and ""black lives matter"" were heard thundering out.

At the intersection where Floyd was pinned down, a crowd chanted, “One down, three to go!” — a reference to the three other fired Minneapolis police officers facing trial in August on charges of aiding and abetting murder in Floyd’s death.

The US had been braced for violence before the jury’s decision, with fears that not guilty verdicts could spark the violent unrest seen last May following Floyd’s death.

More than 3,000 National Guard troops and 1,100 extra cops were drafted into Minneapolis, while the courthouse was ringed with concrete barriers and razor wire.

US President Joe Biden, speaking just hours before the jury came back, said he was “praying” for the “right verdict”.

He said: “The evidence is overwhelming in my view.”

Speaking from the White House, he added: “I’ve come to know George’s family. I can only imagine the pressure and the anxiety they’re feeling. They’re a good family and they’re calling for peace and tranquility.”

Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, added that Biden – who lost his wife and young daughter in a car crash, as well as his eldest son, Beau, to cancer - “knows how it is to lose a family member”.

He added: “He was just letting us know that he was praying for us and hoping that everything would come out to be ok.”

President Biden, vice president Kamala Harris and First Lady Jill Biden called members of the Floyd family moments after the verdict.

In a video posted by Floyd’s lawyer Ben Crump, Biden told the family: “Nothing is going to make it all better, but at least now there is some justice. We're all so relieved.”

Biden said he hoped the verdict would give momentum to police reform efforts in the US.

Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell said the verdict showed that Floyd’s life mattered.

He added: “No verdict can bring George Perry Floyd back to us, but this verdict does give a message to his family that he was somebody, that his life mattered, that all of our lives matter.”

George Floyd's girlfriend, Courteney Ross, called Tuesday a ""huge day for the world"".

She told CNN: ""We’re finally starting to see. We walked around with eyes wide shut for a long time, so they’re starting to open today, and this is going to be the first in a future of change.

""For me, it means that my friends and people that have also lost loved ones now have a chance to get their cases reopened.""

On Monday, the jury was ordered to begin considering its verdict on charges of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

The jury – made up of six white, four black and two mixed race people - deliberated for four hours on Monday, before continuing for six hours yesterday.

The second-degree murder count carries a maximum 40-year sentence, the third-degree murder charge 25-years and ten years in jail for the second-degree manslaughter.

Chauvin will be sentenced at a later date, Judge Peter Cahill said.

Floyd had been arrested after producing a fake banknote at a store in Minneapolis last May.

His shocking death – captured in gruesome bystander video – sparked Black Lives Matter protests around the world.

Prosecutors rested their case on Monday, following a three-week trial, by claiming Floyd died because Chauvin’s heart “was too small”.

They said Chauvin “had to know” that he was squeezing the life out of Floyd.

Prosecutor Steve Schleicher, referring to the video of Floyd pinned to the pavement, told jurors to “believe your eyes”.

He added: “Use your common sense. What you saw, you saw.”

The trial judge Peter Cahill later claimed that a Democratic politician, Maxine Waters, may have recklessly given Chauvin grounds to appeal.

The Californian congresswoman visited Minneapolis this week and urged protestors to stay on the streets and “get more active” and “more confrontational” if the verdict was not guilty.

And the 70-year-old monster has caused new outrage by saying he'd like to take one of his victims back in an interview with journalist alleged to be Putin's god-daughter.

Mokhov became known as the ""Skopin Maniac"" for his horrific imprisonment and rape of Ekaterina Martynova and Elena Samokhina, who were 14 and 17 years old respectively when he abducted the pair as they left a disco in 2000.

During their nightmare ordeal, Samokhina gave birth to two babies in the dungeon – Mokhov took the infants and abandoned them in the stairwells of apartment buildings.

Samokhina had a third, stillborn baby after she and Martynova were freed after nearly three years in May 2004.

Now in a highly controversial interview, which is already being investigated by Russian authorities, Mokhov was given airtime to justify his crimes in a chat with prominent journalist Kseniya Sobchak.

""She gave birth from me but not any more,"" Mokhov says of Samokhina in the interview.

""I must take her on again.”

Abducted and drugged

Samokhina and Martynova weren't even the first girls subjected to Mokhov's horrific depravity.

In 1999, former mining college student Mokhov lured a 16-year-old and her boyfriend to his home in Skopin, around 150 miles south of Moscow.

He plied them with alcohol but the teenage girl resisted his advances – after she tried to leave, he dragged her to his bunker and raped her.

She managed to escape after two weeks when he didn't lock the bunker properly, but she didn't report the incident to the police for fear Mokhov would find her.

Less than a year later, the rapist spotted Martynova and Samokhina leaving a disco and offered them a lift.

Seeing Mokhov's girlfriend Yelena Badukina was also in the car, the teenagers thought they'd be safe.

They got in and were offered vodka – which they didn't know was mixed with sedatives.

Soon they found themselves inside a dingy concrete bunker seven metres underground, locked behind steel, bolted doors.

The bunker was split into three sections, including a living space furnished with a bed and table, and a room with pornographic images plastered on the walls where Mokhov would rape the girls one at a time.

They were trapped – and would be for nearly four years.

Locked deep underground

Down in the dark, Mokhov subjected them to unimaginable suffering.

When they resisted his sex attacks, he would punish the girls by starving them for days, cutting them with a knife, or even spraying tear gas into the dungeon.

He'd also threaten to turn off the electricity and ventilation system, choking them of breathable air and plunging them into the freezing cold.

Under the thick concrete walls, no one outside could hear cries for help.

Mokhov would conversely reward them for compliance, bringing them books, music cassettes and paints, the latter of which they used to daub a sun on the grey concrete of their cell.

""It's hard to realise that you are underground and do not know when this will all end. Therefore, at first we cried a lot and often,"" Martynova told Meduza.

16 The room which led into the living space was sealed behind a thick steel door

""Over time, not that we got used to it and resigned ourselves, but understood that we must live. We began to draw up a daily routine: cooking, eating, watching TV, I was drawing, Lena was studying English.""

Samokhina also gave birth to two sons, delivered by Martynova, in the dank dungeon.

Mokhov knew the babies would die in the bunker, so he secretly abandoned them in places he knew they'd be found and taken to orphanages.

Eventually, Mokhov grew dissatisfied and wanted a new victim in his harem – a medical student who was lodging in his house.

By 2003, he'd been taking Martynova into an upper chamber of the bunker for fresh air, which signalled a loosening of security after keeping the girls in a six-metre-square cell for years.

He would also sometimes let her into the house to wash in a bath, as opposed to relying on the buckets of water he normally brought into the bunker.

He ordered Martynova to pretend to be his niece in a bid to convince the lodger to stay – but instead, Martynova secreted a note inside a cassette tape which she gave to the student to warn her of the mortal danger she was in.

The student fled and contacted the police, who quickly found and freed the captives.

'Lonely hell'

Officers filmed the moment they found the girls who'd been presumed dead for years.

""They did try to escape but they failed and were scared he would beat them so over time they became resigned to their fate,"" Major Igor Shelestiuk of the Russian Interior Ministry told the press shortly after their release.

""The girls almost got used to their conditions and just waited for the bitter end. They were convinced they would die in that lonely hell.""

He added: ""God knows how they will ever get over this.""

At trial, it emerged that Mokhov had also been living with his mother in the home – who claimed to have no knowledge of the dungeon, or the fact that Martynova was enslaved.

""I wanted to have many children,"" Mokhov told investigators about his motive. ""I wanted to improve the demographic situation of Russia.""

Mokhov was sentenced to 17 years in a maximum security penal colony for his crimes.

His accomplice, Elena Badukina, was given five-and-a-half years for helping to kidnap the girls.

On March 3 this year, Makhov was released after serving his sentence.

""Such crimes should be given a life sentence,"" Martynova said earlier this month.

""I have always understood that 17 years will end sooner or later, but now it is hard to believe that he is free.""

'A deep wound that won't heal'

Just three weeks on from his release, Russia was outraged by his lengthy interview with Kseniya Sobchak.

Over the course of the programme, which was published on Sobchak's YouTube channel, Mokhov tries to justify his crimes and gives the journalist a tour of the bunker as it is today.

16 Mokhov justified his horrifying crimes in an interview with Kseniya Sobchak Credit: YouTube / Ксения Собчак

He also tells Sobchak that he considered himself a good man who ""slipped up a little"", adding ""who doesn't?"", The Times reports.

Sobchak has defended the interview, saying accusations that her report could inspire other crimes were just as true of feature films which show fictionalised horrors.

Sobchak is the daughter of Anatoly Sobchak, the former mayor of St Petersburg who was Putin's mentor before the ex-KGB officer went into politics.

The White House said it was ""a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence"" which killed eight people on Tuesday.

Biden's order further directed attention to the victims, six of whom were of Asian descent.

South Korea have confirmed that four of the victims were of Korean descent.

Of the eight dead, seven were women and one was a man, according to officials.

In a statement, the president described the crime was ""very, very troublesome"" but said he would make no comment on the motivation of the shooter until the investigation was complete.

It is not yet clear if it was a racially motivated attack, but cops probing the shooting have said that a ""hate crime"" is not off the table.

The NYPD announced it will deploy officers into Asian communities in response to he shootings and the rising hate crimes against Asian minorities.

On Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said there was ""no question"" Donald Trump's use of the phrase ""Wuhan virus"" during the pandemic helped trigger a rise of hate crimes.

At least eight people were killed at three spa shootings in the Atlanta area on Tuesday

A ""sex addict"" has been charged over the attacks at the massage parlors.

God-fearing Robert Aaron Long, 21, took responsibility for the shootings and told cops that the parlors were a ""temptation that he wanted to eliminate"".

Long was arrested on Tuesday night after leading cops on a three-hour car chase, Cherokee County Sheriff's spokesperson Howard J Baker said.

And cops have released the chilling 911 calls from when the alleged gunman attacked.

Sheriff Frank Reynolds said in a press conference on Wednesday that Long had potential ""sexual addiction"" issues.

CNN later reported that a former roommate had claimed the alleged shooter spent time in a sex rehab clinic.

Sheriff Reynolds said that cops believe Long ""frequented these places in the past"" and that he ""may have been lashing out"".

They added that Long claimed the attack was not racially motivated.

Robert Long remains in custody

Eight people were dead after shootings at three spas in the Atlanta area

Police also revealed that Long bought a gun on the day of the spa slaughter.

During a Thursday afternoon press briefing, Atlanta police said that he often went to the locations he targeted and bought a firearm the day of the murders.

WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR

Eight people have died in three separate shootings at a range of massage parlors.

The first shooting began at around 5pm on March 16 at the Youngs Asian Massage Parlor.

Two people died at the scene, three casualties were transported to the hospital, where another two also died.

Nearly an hour later, the gunman began another shooting spree in the Buckhead neighbourhood of Atlanta at Gold Spa.

Three women were found dead at the second massage parlor.

A fourth woman was shot dead at Aromatherapy Spa, just across the street from Gold Spa.

Seven of the eight victims were women and six were Asian, police say.

Robert Aaron Long, 21, was arrested after a lengthy police pursuit that saw his black 2007 Hyundai Tuscon rammed off the road.

The first shooting took place at Young’s Asian Massage in Acworth, followed by shootings at the Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa in Atlanta.

In the first shooting, two Asian women, one white woman and a white man were killed while three Asian women were then gunned down at Gold Spa, before an Asian woman was shot dead at Aromatherapy Spa.

At around 5pm cops responded to reports of a shooting at Young’s Asian Massage, off Bells Ferry Road and Highway 92 in Acworth, where they found five people with gunshot wounds.

Three people were taken to a hospital, where two of them died.

The Mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms, praised the quick response of authorities in apprehending the offender and offered her sympathies.

She said: ""I commend law enforcement for their quick work in arresting a suspect in the tragic shootings on yesterday.

""A motive is still not clear, but a crime against any community is a crime against us all.

""I have remained in close contact with the White House and APD as they work with federal, state and local partners to investigate the suspect who is responsible for this senseless violence in our city.""

But having survived an assassination attempt which saw him hit by bullets in his stomach and spine in 1978 – as well as numerous legal challenges which sought to censor his smut – Flynt died naturally of heart failure on Wednesday aged 78.

The cigar-chomping, bling-loving American, who was played by Woody Harrelson in 1996 movie The People vs. Larry Flynt, built a $100million porn empire that stretched from magazines to private clubs, a Los Angeles casino, an online sex-toy store and more.

He was best known for his magazine Hustler which repeatedly tested the boundaries of free speech with its extremely explicit sexual content.

It infamously published everything from topless pictures of former First Lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis to images depicting gang rape.

Flynt spent much of his life defending himself against charges of obscenity in and out of court – and it was near a courthouse that he was shot by a white supremacist serial killer who took exception to an interracial porn shoot printed in Hustler.

After being shot, Flynt was paralysed from the waist down and used a $17,000 gold plated and velvet-upholstered wheelchair.

A self-styled defender of America’s First Amendment – which promises freedom of speech and press – he delighted in causing controversy.

His magazine offended an incredible range of groups from left-wing feminists to anti-porn conservatives and just about everyone in between.

“I wanted to offend everyone on an equal-opportunity basis,” he wrote in his 1996 autobiography, An Unseemly Man.

“I decided to run cartoons lampooning blacks, whites, Jews, Christians, rich and poor.”

Naked waitresses and extreme porn

From an early age, Flynt showed the world he had no desire to live conventionally.

Born to an alcoholic father and a teenage mother in a poverty-stricken part of Kentucky, he dropped out of school at 15 and used a fake birth certificate to join the Army.

When they kicked him out after seven months, he lied again and joined the Navy as a radio operator for five years.

After that, in 1965 he spent $1,800 of his savings to buy his mother’s bar in Dayton, Ohio which would be the beginning of his business empire.

Flynt brought in naked hostesses to serve drinks and would work 20-hour days, taking amphetamines to stay awake.

His business was soon making $1,000 a week and he used the cash to buy other bars.

By the early 1970s, he had the template for his Hustler adult clubs. Then he struck upon the idea of transforming the club’s basic newsletter into a full-blown porn magazine.

From its first issue in 1974, Hustler magazine was designed to shock.

Flynn calculated that men wanted “raw sex” – not the stylised version presented by glossier rivals.

He said: “Playboy and Penthouse were parading their pornography as art, with the airbrushing and the soft lens. I realised that if we became more explicit, we could get a huge piece of this market.”

With this in mind, nothing was off the table for Hustler - from close up shots of female genitalia to depictions of gang rape, fairytale characters engaging in sexual acts, and one cover which showed a woman being fed head-first into a meat grinder.

One regular cartoon character, Chester the Molester, was shown tricking pre-pubscent girls into sexually compromising situations.

And in 1975, Hustler created a global scandal when it printed paparazzi photographs of former First Lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis sunbathing topless while on holiday - paying $18,000 for the shots after rivals Playboy and Penthouse rejected the pictures.

As Hustler raced to become ever more hardcore, many people were appalled.

But Flynt revelled in defending his work, framing it as a battle for free speech.

“My position has always been that there’s two types of people opposed to pornography,” he once said during a TV interview, “Those who don’t know what they’re talking about, and those who don’t know what they’re missing.”

At the height of its popularity, Hustler had a readership of three million, allowing Flynt to get into other business ventures including porn movies and mainstream magazines.

But his dirty empire kept him in constant legal trouble, with his first of several prosecutions for obscenity in 1976.

During another trial, he wore an American flag as a nappy, which caused him to be jailed for six months for desecrating the flag.

His most high profile court battle came in 1983 when televangelist Jerry Falwell sued Flynt for $45million.

Falwell argued he should be financially compensated for the “ridicule and emotional distress” caused by a satirical cartoon published in Hustler, which showed him boasting of losing his virginity to his mother in an outhouse.

13 Flynt with the satirical advert that landed him in the Supreme Court

The case went all the way to the Supreme Court who ruled unanimously in Flynt’s favour, saying that offensive speech aimed at public figures like Falwell was constitutionally protected as long as it wasn’t presented as factual.

After the trial, the porn mogul and the preacher who sued him became unlikely friends.

Gunned down by white supremacist murderer

A more dramatic court showdown was to come. While defending himself against more obscenity charges, Flynt and his lawyer, Gene Reeves Jr., were gunned down outside a courthouse near Atlanta, Georgia, in 1978.

Flynt was paralysed by the attack and left suffering excruciating pain in his legs and related health problems for the rest of his life.

Joseph Paul Franklin, a KKK member and serial killer, later confessed to the shooting, saying he was motivated by interracial pornography in Hustler.

Franklin was executed by lethal injection 2013 – something which Flynt publicly opposed.

He didn’t want Franklin dead, but he did want revenge.

“I would love an hour in a room with him and a pair of wire-cutters and pliers so I could inflict the same damage on him that he inflicted on me,” he wrote in the Hollywood Reporter.

'You have to tolerate Larry Flynt'

Flynt’s opposition to the execution of his attacker wasn’t the only belief he held which shocked people.

In 1977, he briefly declared himself a born-again Christian after having a divine vision while on his private jet, vowing his magazine would “hustle for God”.

For a brief spell – during which he was friends with evangelist Ruth Carter Stapleton, sister of President Jimmy Carter – Flynt toned down Hustler’s content.

But before long he had declared himself an atheist once more – and Hustler went back to its old ways.

Having dabbled with religion, Flynt also tried his hand at politics, making a “tongue-in-cheek” run for president in 1984 as a Republican.

Fourteen years later, he declared he was a Democrat – predictably supporting Bill Clinton in the impeachment proceedings which followed the Monica Lewinsky affair.

Flynt has four surviving children from five marriages – having racked up three divorces by the time he was 33.

His oldest daughter, Tonya Flynt-Vega, is a Christian anti-porn activist who published a book, Hustled, in 1998 accusing Flynt of sexually abusing her as a child.

Flynt denied the claims.

His fourth wife, Althea, was pictured in Hustler and went on to become the magazine’s co-publisher, keeping it running when Flynt was shot.

She was just 17 when she met Flynt by applying to be a go-go dancer at one of his clubs.

They married in 1976 and stayed together until her death 11 years later when she drowned in the bath of their Bel-Air mansion, aged 33.

In 1998, Flynt married his fifth wife, Elizabeth Berrios, his former nurse.

That marriage came two years after the release of the Oscar-nominated film about his life and legal troubles, The People Vs Larry Flynt.

The film was criticised by some for sanitising Flynt’s career and views.

But according to the man himself, the nastier side of him was the cost of preserving free speech.

The 19 Kids & Counting stars have weathered a string of scandals during their turbulent marriage, from molestation claims to cheating and a porn addiction.

Fired reality star Josh, 33, was taken into custody on federal charges on Thursday afternoon, The Sun exclusively revealed.

An insider claimed he ""turned himself in"" without incident.

The charges are related to the 2019 Homeland Security raid on his now-shuttered used car dealership in Springdale, Arkansas.

The bombshell bust comes just six years after claims the shamed ex-reality star molested five girls as a teen.

Anna, 32, and the Duggar family stood by Josh through his disturbing sex abuse scandal in 2015.

That year, In Touch Weekly uncovered a 33-page Arkansas police report claiming Jim Bob confessed to local authorities that his eldest son fondled young girls while they were asleep in the Duggar family home back in 2002.

The In Touch report also claimed that in 2006, the Arkansas Child Abuse Hotline received a tip that there was abuse happening in the Duggar household, and the Springdale Police Department reached out to the family for interviews.

Josh addressed the allegations at the time, saying: ""Twelve years ago, as a young teenager, I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret.""

""I hurt others, including my family and close friends.""

Josh was never charged with any crime related to the incidents.

His sisters Jill and Jessa came forward as victims in an interview with reporter Megyn Kelly, though they insisted they had forgiven Josh for his sins.

Jim Bob and Michelle said of the report: “Back 12 years ago our family went through one of the most difficult times of our lives.""

12 Later in 2015, Josh was accused of using adultery dating website Ashley Madison Credit: TLC

""When Josh was a young teenager, he made some very bad mistakes and we were shocked. We had tried to teach him right from wrong.

“That dark and difficult time caused us to seek God like never before. Even though we would never choose to go through something so terrible, each one of our family members drew closer to God.”

In the fallout, the family's reality show 19 Kids & Counting was canceled, and Josh was fired from his position at Christian lobbying group the Family Research Council.

He was not included in the family's later spinoff show, Counting On.

But the scandals didn't stop there, as another report just three months later claimed Josh was using adultery dating service Ashley Madison.

Josh said in a statement: ""I have been the biggest hypocrite ever. While espousing faith and family values, I have secretly over the last several years been viewing pornography on the Internet and this has become a secret addiction and I became unfaithful to my wife.""

Soon after, porn star Danica Dillon, whose real name is Ashley Johnston, claimed he assaulted her during a sexual encounter.

In a 2020 interview with The Sun, Ashley, 33, described the alleged incident as being so intense ""it felt like this guy tried to kill me.""

She accused him of choking, spitting and calling her ""worthless"" during rough intercourse after they allegedly met at a Philadelphia strip club in 2015.

She claimed he invited her up to his room after he paid $600 for lap dances from her.

Ashley, now a married mom of four, said Josh ""knows what he's done and has to live with his demons"".

Josh has always denied the alleged assault.

Anna stood by Josh throughout all the scandals and earlier this month confirmed that she's pregnant with their seventh child.

""It’s a GIRL!!!!!"" she wrote alongside a video of their gender reveal.

""We are overjoyed to announce baby seven is on the way and we can’t wait to hold her in our arms this fall!""

Anna and Josh - who tied the knot in 2008 - are already parents to daughters Mackynzie, 11, Meredith, five, and Maryella, one, and sons Michael, nine, Marcus, seven, and Mason, three.

Anna defended her husband after a fan questioned how they are affording to look after such a large family.

The fan asked: “How do you afford all those kids? Does Josh even work?”

The TV star shot back: “Yes, my husband is a diligent worker and provides well for our family.”

These days, Josh has found it hard to keep a stable job, and currently lives with Anna and his six kids in a warehouse on Jim Bob and Michelle's Arkansas property, The Sun exclusively reported.

A source said: “There's no sign of him working and he only leaves when he drives the family out in a blue minivan.

Most famously, Evan Rachel Wood named Marilyn as her abuser in an Instagram post.

During the most recent episode of The Talk, Sharon opened up about her relationship of 25 years with the singer.

She told the women around her: ""[I’ve] worked with him for many, many years, and, obviously, I would not know what goes on in his bedroom; neither do I want to.

""But as far as people who’ve been going on all my socials, calling me names and things and putting up pictures of Marilyn and I, you know, there’s something called a working relationship, and that’s what I’ve had with Marilyn for many years.

""I know nothing about his sexual preferences or the way he treats women.

""I know how he treats an older woman, which is me, and he’s always been respectful.""

Marilyn has always been close to Sharon and her husband Ozzy Osbourne, and was even set to appear with him during his 2020 tour before it was canceled.

Sharon speaking about her relationship with Marilyn comes as several women have recounted horror experiences they had with the singer.

First was Evan, who joined by four other women, denounced Marilyn and claimed he abused her for years.

The 33-year-old Westworld actress took to Instagram in the early hours of Monday to reveal the identity of her alleged abuser.

She claimed: ""The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson.

""He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail.

""I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives.

""I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.""

Hours after she accused her ex of the abuse, Marilyn posted a statement on his Instagram denying the allegations.

He wrote: “Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.

“My intimate relationships have always been entire consensual with like-minded partners.

“Regardless of how - and why - others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.”

She had met Marilyn when she was just 18 years old and he was 36 and married to Dita Von Teese.

Following Evan's statement, other women came forward with similar allegations.

A stylist claimed that Marilyn held a gun to her head during a 2010 photoshoot.

Bailey, who is trans, also claimed Manson told her: ""I don't like f*****s"".

She reportedly first made the claims in social media posts in 2017, but repeated them in a video posted to Instagram this week.

The Sun also reported that it wasn't just sexual partners that the singer allegedly attacked, but also his mom.

The goth rocker admitted to hitting, spitting on, and trying to choke his mom, Barbara Warner, during violent outbursts in his youth.

Barbara died following a battle with dementia aged 68 in 2014.

Marilyn subsequently described his late mother as ""the first and greatest believer in me,"" adding: ""I’ll make you proud and satisfied that you know that you made the son you wanted.""

Singer Phoebe Bridgers also claimed that Marilyn ""bragged about having a 'rape room' in his home.""

""He referred to a room in his house as the “r*pe room”, I thought it was just his horrible frat boy sense of humor. I stopped being a fan.""

""I stand with everyone who came forward,"" she said, before blasting his management and other alleged enablers of his behavior.

She claimed: ""The label knew, management knew, the band knew. Distancing themselves now, pretending to be shocked and horrified is f***ing pathetic.""

Cops swooped on a man, 50, in Cheshire nearly 20 years after Stuart was found in a pool at the TV star’s Essex mansion.

Officers are set to contact Barrymore, 68, today.

He is said to be “relieved” by the arrest and hopes it will bring the family closure.

The terminally-ill dad of Stuart Lubbock yesterday told of his last wish to get justice for his tragic son.

Terry Lubbock, 76, spoke as police arrested a man, 50, on suspicion of murder over the 2001 death.

Terry, who has cancer and months to live, said: “This has been my life for the past 20 years.

“I’ve not got long left now, the cancer is through my body and I can’t do anything about it.

“I’m just pleased there’s been an arrest.

“I just want justice for my boy, that’s all I’ve ever wanted since this happened.”

'I HOPE IT'S ALL OVER BEFORE I DIE'

He added: “I’ve had false dawns before. I’ve had my hopes up, then dashed.

“I just want this to be the breakthrough.

“There’s not a day when it’s not with me.

“I hope it’s all over before I die.”

The dramatic arrest was made in Cheshire early yesterday, with the suspect quizzed in custody. Last night he was released on bail until April 12.

Mr Lubbock, who lives in a care home in Harlow, Essex, and Barrymore, 68, were both informed of the developments.

Police acted on new information following The Sun’s doubling of the reward to £40,000 last year — in conjunction with a new appeal and Channel 4 documentary about the death of Stuart, 31.

Mike Browne, the star’s agent from 1984 to 2003, said: “I’ve spoken with Michael about the arrest.

“He just kept saying, ‘Let’s hope this time the police have enough evidence to charge someone for Stuart’s murder’.

“Michael is just hoping that with this arrest and, maybe some new evidence, Stuart’s family can finally get some closure.

“All they want to know is how Stuart was injured and how he died. They have lost a son and deserve answers. That’s what Michael wants above all else as well.

“The theory is that someone came forward because of the reward.”

Investigators believe one of the eight party guests holds the key to the death on March 31, 2001.

Barrymore invited them to his £2million home in Roydon, Essex, following a night out in Harlow.

Police said all eight will be contacted following the new developments with action expected as soon as today.

Yesterday, the guests refused to speak to The Sun, including Barrymore’s ex-lover Jonathan Kenney.

We revealed last year Mr Kenney tells anyone who asks that he “had a good time” at the party.

Arrest comes after significant new information came to light following offer of enhanced reward Det Supt Lucy Morris

Another guest, Kelly Campbell, said yesterday: “I’m not going to talk about the case or the arrest.”

Kylie Merritt, 38, James Futers, 43, and Claire Jones, 37, declined to comment.

Det Supt Lucy Morris, from the Essex force, said earlier yesterday: “The man who was arrested in Cheshire continues to be questioned by our detectives.

“Following the arrest, we immediately notified the Lubbock family.

“This arrest is almost 20 years to the day in which Stuart was found unconscious in a swimming pool, following a party at a home in Roydon. He later died in hospital.

“The arrest comes after significant new information came to light following our renewed appeal for information and offer of an enhanced reward which coincided with a major TV documentary broadcast in February 2020.

“Over the coming days, we will be contacting all those who were at the party at the time, as well as others who may have information.

“As we stated last February — and have continually stated over the last 20 years — we believe someone, or some people, at that party know what happened.

“It is important to re-state the fact that Essex Police has never given up on this case and that the force is motivated by the desire to deliver justice for Mr Lubbock and his family.

“Stuart’s rape and murder has been an extremely lengthy and complex investigation which has spanned over 20 years.

“We have never given up on finding out exactly what happened to Stuart, and we will not stop in our pursuit of justice for him and for his family and friends.

“As we have said repeatedly over the last 20 years, nine people were at that party.

“We know that not everyone was responsible for what happened, but someone was.

'NOW IS THE TIME TO COME FORWARD'

“Now is the time to come forward if you haven’t done so already, to set this matter to rest by providing us with any information you have.”

Former Strike It Lucky quiz host Barrymore and his guests have always denied involvement — maintaining Stuart was drunk and high, and drowned accidentally.

A pool thermometer and a missing shed handle are believed to be important parts of the investigation.

Barrymore’s career collapsed after the tragedy.

He briefly made a comeback in 2006’s Celebrity Big Brother, finishing runner-up to Chantelle Houghton.

A broken hand forced him out of Dancing on Ice in January last year.

The investigation gathered momentum ahead of Channel 4’s Barrymore: The Body in the Pool, aired in February 2020.

For the first time, the show featured the 999 call reporting the death. A man was heard saying: “A fella has drowned in the pool.

“We have got them out. There’s a party going on and someone has just gone out and found him.”

He added: “I tell you what mate, the first time I’ve been out in four f***ing years. I have me kids every weekend and f***ing hell. I think the geezer’s dead, mate.”

Essex Police Det Chief Insp Stephen Jennings welcomed The Sun’s decision to double the reward last year saying: “It’s never too late to do the right thing.”

Nineteen days after he was let out, Doua Por Lao, 39, allegedly shot dead Bao Yang, 39, a nurse and mom, at her home on Saturday before turning the gun on himself in Minnesota.

According to the state's sex offender registry, Lao was a Level 3 sex offender who had ""held a known female teenager against her will and engaged in sexual contact.""

Cops found Yang and Lao with gunshot wounds in St. Paul’s Greater East Side neighborhood on Monday.

Lao died outside his estranged girlfriend's home while Yang passed away in hospital – and local law enforcement believe the convict shot Yang, reported KSTP.

Court documents referenced by the publication indicate that she was his girlfriend and had been harassing her when they broke up.

Back in August 2019, cops were called to Woodbury hospital where Yang alleged that her ex broke into her house, pushed her onto the couch, allegedly raped her, and shaved her hair off with clippers.

Police said Lao told them he ""saw a video on YouTube where a man shaves the head of a woman who cheated on him.""

The filing states she decided not to pursue charges against him as ""Lao continued to harass her and she believed pursuing the case would make things worse for her.""

Last month, Yang filed a petition for an order for protection for her family, which stated that her estranged boyfriend had ""made numerous threats of sextortion and harm"" and had sent naked pictures to his kids' father.

Lao was booked on felony criminal sexual conduct and felony nonconsensual dissemination of private sexual images but on March 1, he was released on bond.

There were allegedly 14 further incidents of harassment over the past eight months that culminated in the horrific murder suicide, when Lao allegedly hunted Yang down again when a judge allowed him out of jail.

Yang's son Vichai Vang, 21, who has an 11-year-old brother, said their mom is dead ""due to domestic violence"" to the horror of his

In a GoFundMe fundraiser, Vang wrote: ""Her life was taken too soon and we are all still grieving and in shock.

The judge that convicted Mathew Hemsley of the crime described the killer as “depraved and ruthless”.

Julie had been living alone when she met the 34-year-old truck driver, at the Saint George Hotel in Innaloo, Perth.

He mentioned that he needed to charge his mobile phone, and Julie offered to let him do it in her car, the Daily Star reported.

The next thing her neighbours knew, Hemsley had moved into her home in Doubleview, a suburb of Perth, and was telling people he was looking after it for Julie while she was away with her boyfriend.

One of Julie’s friends received a text soon after to say she was out of town on holiday.

While living in her home, Hemsley drove around town in her silver Toyota and appeared to be eating her food.

After a week, Julie was missing appointments she’d made, and her son visited her home in an attempt to find out where she was.

Hemsley had gone and Julie’s home was trashed, so her son reported her missing.

Some three weeks after Julie was last seen, police in Western Australia questioned Hemsley.

He told them he’d been in a casual sexual relationship with her for a few weeks and had been staying at her home since.

She had told him to move out, he claimed, because she was getting back together with an ex-partner and moving to Sydney.

Hemsley claimed he didn’t know where she was now.

Julie’s body was found dumped in a gully in bushland in Ashendon a week later.

Police in Perth launched a murder investigation and officers began to piece together the events leading up to Julie’s death; which pointed to Hemsley as the prime suspect.

It is believed that Julie was killed the same day that she met Hemsley; that he had offered to take her to his campervan in bushland and while there, he had sexually assaulted her before strangling her with either a ligature or a collar.

It's thought that he then threw her body down the three-metre gully in which she was found, before heading to a service station to buy petrol so he could set fire to his car at the crime scene.

After committing the horrific crime, Hemsley is said to have moved into Julie’s home and claimed she had moved away.

Hemsley denied killing Julie, and when confronted with CCTV of him driving her car to buy petrol, he claimed she had accidentally “choked herself” to death during rough sex in the bushland.

But investigators didn’t believe Hemsley’s version of events. They arrested him and he was charged with murder.

In August 2019, Hemsley pleaded not guilty via video link from prison; despite the fact he had told an inmate in prison that he had killed Julie himself.

He faced court in 2020 and his defence doubled down on his claims of innocence.

The jury dismissed his claims that Julie had choked herself during a sexual act, and found Hemsley guilty of murder.

The judge described the killer as “depraved and ruthless” and noted he had “not shown any remorse” for his actions.

Hemsley was sentenced to life in prison.

He will serve a minimum of 23 years before being considered for parole.

The 37-year-old - who was once the highest-paid tight end in the NFL -appeared in a videoconference at the hearing in San Diego Superior Court in Vista.

He reportedly chose not to comment prior to his sentence, as his lawyers requested him not to speak.

However, Winslow - dubbed a ""sexual predator"" by the San Diego County Superior Court Judge Blaine Bowman - revealed he plans to tell his story ""in the future.""

According to the judge, the former NFL player preyed on vulnerable women and has been ordered to register as a sex offender for the remainder of his life.

The victims of Winslow's ""brazen"" crimes included a 54-year-old hitchhiker, a teen who lost consciousness at a party, and a homeless woman in his hometown Encinitas, whom he befriended.

Judge Bowman said Winslow continued to attack women after his first arrest.

Bowman said: ""The vulnerability of the victims was no accident.

""It was the type of victim that you sought out yourself because you felt that perhaps they wouldn’t report the crime"" or ""wouldn’t be deemed credible by the jurors.""

Winslow received the maximum sentence under his plea deal.

The dad-of-two was convicted of forcible rape, rape of an unconscious person, assault with intent to commit rape, indecent exposure, and lewd conduct in public.

Winslow, wearing a GS monitoring ankle bracelet, once performed a vulgar act in front of a 77-year-old woman at a gym, Bowman said, adding that the ex-sports star hid the monitor with a towel.

He also intentionally exposed his genitals to a 57-year-old neighbor who was gardening, the judger said.

Four of his victims gave statements during Wednesday's hearing - all who said they suffered from feat and emotional trauma following the attacks.

During the videoconference, the homeless woman said: ""I don’t ever feel safe inside or outside. You brought so much damage to my life.""

His 77-year-old victim said: ""This is somebody who has been allowed to utilize his financial privilege and celebrity to evade jail while awaiting trial, which is when he victimized me.

""It shows this is a defendant who does not learn from his mistakes, who shows no respect to our laws.""

Winston was convicted in 2019 of raping the homeless woman in 2018.

His attacks began in 2003 and continued through June 2019.

Child killers and serial rapists have ended up behind bars thanks to the show's appeals, but executives swung the axe on the crime reconstruction series in 2017.

Even its spin-off show, Crimewatch Roadshow Live, was forced to take a break earlier this year because of the pandemic.

But it will be back this week to continue examining some of the nation's most despicable crimes, including a rise in attacks on homeless people.

Before its return, here are some of the most disturbing offences Crimewatch helped to solve – from child killings to serial rape attacks.

Teen sexually assaulted and strangled to death

The first case ever shown on Crimewatch was the chilling murder of Colette Aram, who was just 16 years old when she was abducted, raped and murdered in 1983.

Colette was walking to her boyfriend's house in Keyworth, Notts., when she disappeared.

Worried friends and family called police to help look for her that evening – her naked body was found dumped around a mile and a half from where she was taken.

A reconstruction of Colette's shocking murder was broadcast on Crimewatch in June 1984, leading to over 400 tip-off calls from the public.

The case was also shown in the 20th anniversary episode of Crimewatch in 2004, but Colette's killer remained at large until 2008.

Jean-Paul Hutchinson was arrested for a driving offence that year, and his DNA was a near-identical match of the profile police had made of Colette's killer.

But Jean-Paul was only 20 in 2008, meaning he hadn't been born at the time of Colette's murder.

The close match led cops to his dad, Paul Stewart Hutchinson, who eventually pleaded guilty to the killing in December 2009.

He was jailed for life in January 2010 but he died in October that year after being found unconscious in his cell at Nottingham Prison after taking a suspected overdose.

Toddler abduction and train track torture

In February 1993, two 10-year-old schoolboys abducted two-year-old James Bulger from the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle, Merseyside, when James' mum briefly took her eyes off him.

The boys led James by the hand to a railway line near a disused station where they beat him to death with bricks, stones and an iron bar.

They left his body across the tracks in the hope that his death would look like an accident – he was cut in half by a train after they fled the scene.

But investigators quickly realised James had been murdered when his body was discovered two days later.

CCTV footage of the killers taking James from the shopping centre was shown on Crimewatch and two witnesses called in to say they'd seen Robert Thompson and Jon Venables with the toddler.

They were both convicted of the killing in 1993, becoming the youngest murderers in English history.

Hammer horror

In July 1996, 45-year-old Lin Russell was walking down a country lane in Chillenden, Kent, with her two daughters, six-year-old Megan and nine-year-old Josie, and their pet dog Lucy, when the family were attacked by a thug with a hammer.

They were tied up and brutally beaten by the assailant – only Josie survived, but police assumed all three were dead when they saw their horrific head injuries.

In July 1997, cops arrested Michael Stone for the murders after they received a tip-off from someone who'd watched a reconstruction of the attack on Crimewatch.

Stone was sentenced to a minimum of 25 years in prison but, to this day, he maintains his innocence and blames the crimes on serial killer Levi Bellfield.

Locked in a coffin for eight days

In January 1992, 25-year-old estate agent Stephanie Slater was kidnapped at a house viewing by a man who took her to a warehouse in Newark, Nottinghamshire.

Blindfolded, bound, and with electrodes attached to her legs, Slater was stuffed into a makeshift coffin inside a wheelie bin where she was kept locked up for eight days.

Her captor let her go after Slater's estate agency paid a ransom for her release.

Crimewatch aired a phone call recording of the voice of someone they suspected was Slater's captor and Michael Sams' first wife recognised it was her ex-husband.

Sams was arrested and DNA evidence confirmed that he'd also been responsible for the 1991 kidnap and murder of 18-year-old Julie Dart.

Dart had also been kept chained in a coffin-like box and was beaten to death with a hammer after being made to write letters demanding a ransom to her boyfriend.

Sams is now serving life in prison and, in June this year, was deemed too dangerous to be released, despite being 78 years old.

Schoolboy gunned down in gangland crossfire

Rhys Jones was just 11 years old when he was shot in the back on the way home from football practice in Croxteth, Liverpool, in August 2007.

A hooded teen on a bike had fired three shots from a Smith & Wesson .455 revolver from the First World War.

Rhys Jones was only 11 years old when he was shot dead in 2007

He'd been aiming at rival gang members, but hit Rhys instead.

After a direct appeal from Rhys' heartbroken mum on Crimewatch, 12 people who rang in gave the same name of the murderer.

Sean Mercer of the Croxeth Crew gang, who was 16 at the time of the killing, was sentenced to a minimum of 22 years in 2008.

Sean Mercer was sentenced when he was 18, but had pulled the trigger when he was just 16

Other gang members and their parents were also sentenced for assisting Mercer and perverting the course of justice.

'Trophy Rapist'

Cops first realised they were dealing with an exceptionally sadistic criminal when, in 2002, a rapist used his victim's phone to taunt her mum about having raped her daughter just an hour after the assault.

The twisted serial sex attacker became known as the M25 Rapist because his similar crimes were found in Surrey, Kent and London.

Predator Antoni Imiela was known as the M25 rapist for his appalling crimes

He would go up behind his victims, drag them to a secluded area and rape them, sometimes at knifepoint.

The monster was also known as the ""Trophy Rapist"" because he would sometimes keep victims' clothing after forcing them to undress.

Some also said he ordered them to tell him that they loved him during the attacks.

His first victim was a 10-year-old girl whom he abducted from outside a police-run youth club in Ashford, Kent, but unusually for a serial rapist he also targeted adults, with his oldest victim being aged 52.

Imiela died in prison aged 63 two years ago

Once cops had built up a DNA profile of the attacker, they launched a massive public appeal, including by broadcasting an e-fit of the suspect on Crimewatch.

One was a girl, who was aged five when the alleged abuse began, and the second a boy under the age of 11.

Ahmed, who was made a life peer in 1998 by then-PM Tony Blair, denies rape, attempted rape and indecent assault.

His brothers, Mohammed Tariq, 65, and Mohamed Farouq, 70, are also accused of sexual abuse and deny the charges.

Cops launched their probe into the former politician in 2016 after one of his alleged victims stepped forward after decades of silence.

ABUSE CLAIMS

She was followed by the second victim who claimed he had been abused by Ahmed and his brothers.

The two alleged victims later spoke on the phone after the male complainant tracked her down online, the court was told.

In a recorded conversation played to the jury he told her: ""He (Ahmed) did the same thing to me as he did to you, the b*****d.

""I'm glad you're taking it further. I have spoken to the police myself to make a complaint.

""I don't want the b*****ds to get away with it.""

I don't want the b*****ds to get away with it Alleged victim

The female alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, replied: ""They did us a great wrong.

""They are going to try their best to deny it. I have been quiet all my life.

""This is our window of opportunity now. The police have moved on. They are taking these cases seriously.

""They have got at least 60 politicians under investigation as part of Operation Hydrant. They are coming for them.

""This is our one opportunity to right the wrongs of our past.

‘I SEEK JUSTICE‘

""I seek justice and I want justice for you too. We have buried it for so long now.

""It takes one, just one person, to break that silence and it helps others to come forward.

""I've waited so long and I'm not waiting anymore.

""It's time now to seek justice for that little boy who couldn't protect himself.""

Prosecutor Tom Little told the jury at Sheffield Crown Court the abuse of the victims took place over a number of years at various addresses in Rotherham, South Yorks.

He said: ""Those who were abused were too young to stop it and too young to do anything about it.

""Those that it happened to kept it buried away for many years, as we say is so often the case.

""They did not complain at the time which again we say is so often the case.

""The three defendants had hoped their criminal acts would never see the light of day.

""However, it's now no longer buried away. They have now complained.

""Not just to those they know or love but more recently to the police. This abuse was perpetrated by three defendants, all of whom are brothers.

""At the time the defendants were teenagers. This was not isolated or innocent sexual experimentation by children.

""It was abuse, pure and simply.""

Ahmed was arrested and interviewed by cops in May 2016 but refused to answer any questions.

He now says the offences never took place and claims the allegations against him are a ""malicious fiction"".

Trial judge Jeremy Richardson told the jury that whilst Ahmed was on trial, his brothers were not.

Nicola Holton, 36, told the teenager ""she could not wait until 2023 when he would be 18"" and preyed on him on two occasions, a court heard.

The mother contacted her 15-year-old victim saying she needed help with an online game her son was playing.

She lured him to her home by inviting him to watch a film then made him kiss her and put her hand down his trousers.

The sick mum gave him oral sex and also used her hands to perform a sexual act on another occasion.

Holton, of Worcester, Worcs., was jailed for four years at Worcester Crown Court yesterday.

She admitted two counts of sexual activity with a child and one of sexual communication with a child between August 31 and October 10 last year.

Prosecutor Caroline Harris told the court the boy had said he ""wanted it to stop and then he would just be a normal child"".

JAILED FOR ABUSE

Mrs Harris said Holton ""put her hand inside his trousers"" and performed two sex acts on him with her hand and her mouth.

Holton also later sent him messages ""suggesting she was pleasuring herself"". The victim said he removed those messages because he did not want to see them.

On another occasion she again kissed him and used her hands to perform a sexual act.

Mrs Harris said: ""He felt he could not say anything about what happened because he was afraid he would get into trouble.

""He was asking the officer what his punishment might be for what had happened.

""It was noted by the officer that he was in tears at various stages, showing the distress that has been caused.""

BOY FELT HE WOULD BE 'JUDGED'

Holton even told the boy ""she could not wait until 2023 when he would be 18"" and that she had to keep on reminding herself ""he was only 15"".

The prosecutor said: ""He does recall feeling pressured to do as he did.""

In a statement from the boy's mother she described how her son had struggled to sleep and had become reluctant to be seen out of the house following the incidents.

She said he felt he would be looked at, questioned and “judged” over what happened.

His mother said: ""I noticed a real change in him. He was coming in from school and becoming immediately angry. He had turned into someone I did not recognise at all.""

Fiona Elder, defending, said Holton had ""an inability to cope on her own"" after a controlling relationship with her ex-husband.

VICTIM BLAMING

Judge Nicolas Cartwright said: ""You seduced him, kissing him, taking him into your bedroom in your flat then performing oral sex upon him.""

He told her that she then went on to ""repeat the behaviour"", that the boy had been ""conflicted"" after the first occasion and ""sent messages initially saying he did not want your sexual attention"".

The judge said: ""You should have known a good deal better in any event given that you were working in childcare and have obtained a diploma. You were very well aware of how serious this offending was.""

He also noted ""you have two boys of your own and you could have been under no illusions just how serious your actions were.""

Judge Cartwright also said she had not expressed ""significant remorse"".

He added: ""Your sorrow was only for the fact you had found yourself remanded in custody. There was a good deal of victim blaming going on during the course of that interview.""

Holton can expect to serve half of the custodial sentence in custody and half on licence in the community.

An indefinite restraining order and a sexual harm prevention order were also made.

The restraining order prevents her having contact, directly or indirectly, with the boy or from attending his address or any future address at which she knows or believes him to reside.

Katie had previously revealed what happened to her as a child during an honest chat for the Changes with Annie Macmanus podcast.

She said: ""My thing that’s always been wrong in my life is men. That is from an early age.

The shocking scene, from the new Netflix series The Lost Pirate Kingdom, shows the brutality of life on the high seas in the golden age of piracy.

The eight part documentary series with dramatic reenactments, reveals how the 18th century privateers - seamen paid by the state to raid enemy ships in the war between England and Spain - became lawless pirates in peacetime.

Ruthless killers including Blackbeard, Edward Low and the notorious Charles Vane used intimidation, torture and brutality to steal gold, silver and ships.

They even set up their own kingdom in Nassau, in the Bahamas, to escape the law.

Jessica Cale, author of Dirty, Sexy History, tells the show: “This is a culture of horrendous violence. Men could be beaten, sometimes to death, for minor indiscretions.”

The real pirates of the Caribbean were far more bloodthirsty than Jack Sparrow in the movies.

From crew members routinely lashed with whips, beaten and kicked to hostages being disembowelled alive, we look at the grisly life and crimes of real pirates.

Sadist who revelled in gruesome murders

Thought to have grown up in the East End of London, Charles Vane was known for his sadistic streak towards crew and enemy alike.

In one notorious incident, in 1718, Vane and his crew looted the Bermuda sloop Diamond and viciously beat the captain and crew.

Vane then singled out one crew member, Nathaniel Catling, to be hung.

16 Charles Vane was known as one of the most sadistic pirates

Thinking he was dead, they pulled him from the noose but he revived ""whereupon one of the pirates hacked him across the collarbone with his cutlass and would have continued until he had murdered him had not one of the other pirates persuaded him it 'was too great a cruelty.'""

His brutality towards his crew, who he also cheated of the spoils of their raids, meant frequent mutinies and eventually led to his downfall.

After being shipwrecked on an inhabited island in the Bay of Honduras, Vane was rescued by a ship - only for a former member of his own crew to recognise him and hand him over the authorities.

Vane was hanged and gibbeted - dipped in tar and hung in a steel cage as a warning to others.

Teen wife forced to sleep with crew

A close friend and colleague of Vane, Edward Thatch - better known as Blackbeard - revelled in his reputation for brutality.

A former privateer, who learned his trade aboard the pirate ships of Nassau founder Benjamin Hornigold, Thatch branched out on his own by commandeering a huge French vessel and equipping her with 40 guns. He named her 'Queen Anne's Revenge'.

Blackbeard instilled fear in crews and captives alike and, while many think his violent reputation was exaggerated, he lived up to the legend with random acts of violence.

According to contemporary writer Daniel Defoe, he once shot his second-in-command, Israel Hands in the knee under the table during a game of cards, leaving with a limp for life.

16 Captain Blackbeard was feared by crew and enemies

When asked why, he answered that, “if he did not now and then kill one of them, they would forget who he was.""

After obtaining a pardon from the governor of North Carolina, Blackbeard married 16-year-old Mary Ormond, the daughter of a local landowner, in 1718.

Defoe wrote: “After he had lain all night, it was his custom to invite five or six of his brutal companions to come ashore, and he would force her to prostitute herself to them all, one after another, before his face.""

Blackbeard was decapitated by naval officer Robert Maynard during the capture of his ship, in 1718.

Captain's lips cut off and boiled

Brought up in a family of criminals, London-born Edward Low moved to Boston and married Eliza Marble, in 1714.

When Eliza died in childbirth, Low turned to piracy and became known for his brutality, capturing over 100 ships gleefully torturing their crew.

Victims were cut, whipped, burned and starved to death in an effort to glean information about sunken treasures and ship schedules.

One of his favourite torture techniques involved tying a victim's hands with rope between their fingers and setting it alight, burning their flesh down to the bones.

A letter describing one raid on a Portuguese ship claimed Low: ""Cut off the said Master's lips and broiled them before his face, and afterwards murdered the whole crew, being thirty-two persons.""

Low was thought to have been caught and hanged by the French.

Innards nailed to post in deadly 'dance'

Known as ‘the exterminator’ for his love of slaughtering the enemy, French buccaneer Daniel Montbars came from a wealthy family but his hatred of the Spanish led him to a life on the high seas.

After one raid on a Spanish galleon, one witness said he slaughtered numerous crew members, adding: “His only pleasure seemed to be to contemplate, not the treasures of the vessel, but the number of dead and dying Spaniards.""

One particularly gruesome method of murder was cutting open the stomach of his victim, extracting one end of his intestines and nailing it to a post.

He would then force the man to dance to his death by beating his behind with a burning log.

Female pirate stabbed servant at 13

Irish pirate Anne Bonny, the daughter of a lawyer and one of his servants, was dressed as a boy when she was growing up on a Carolina plantation.

Anne’s mother died when she was 12 and she began to spiral out of control - reportedly stabbing a servant when she was just 13 and setting fire to her father’s plantation.

16 Fierce Anne Bonny depicted in painting circa 1710 Credit: Getty

She married sailor, James Bonny, and moved to Nassau, quickly abandoning her husband and turning to piracy when she met infamous buccaneer Calico Jack.

The pair had a child together before taking to the seas - where Anne earned a reputation of being fierce and brave.

Anne was captured after fighting Navy soldiers on deck, while her husband and crew were drunk below, and escaped hanging because she was pregnant.

Her last words to her husband, before he was executed were: ""Had you fought like a man, you need not have been hang'd like a dog.""

Naked woman roasted alive

Sir Henry Morgan is a celebrated figure in privacy legend and was lauded as a hero for his attacks against Spanish ships and territories during the 17th century war with England.

But some contemporary accounts accused him of torturing the citizens of Portobello, Spain, which he captured 1668.

Russian state investigators say Daria Shavelkina, 30, was “envious” of pal Yaroslava Korolyova, 30, who had a loving husband and a happy home life.

Shavelkina, a Clarins cosmetics consultant, was pregnant at the time and had met the other woman at her home in the Russian capital to collect secondhand baby clothes.

When Yaroslava turned away, it's alleged the beautician suddenly picked up the baby and flung her out of the window.

There had been no quarrel between the friends before the shocking incident, say reports.

The tragic mother rushed downstairs but her baby was lying lifeless on the ground, according to eyewitnesses.

Paramedics then pronounced the little girl dead when they arrived at the heartbreaking scene.

The mother-of-three was then left “in deep shock” and required urgent assistance from medics.

Shavelkina was quickly detained and later reportedly told police she had ""heard voices in her head"" telling her to throw the baby to her death.

She also reportedly claimed that she was mentally ill.

However, Russian psychiatric experts at the Serbsky Institute later examined her and said she was “faking” schizophrenia, say reports.

They claimed it was a charade to avoid any responsibility for the murder, revealed the Investigative Committee.

As a result, she will stand trial for murder of a minor and now faces up to 20 years in jail if convicted.

How many episodes are there?

The next episode of I May Destroy You is airing on BBC One TONIGHT (June 29) at 10.55pm.

What is it about and why should you watch?

The show has daringly taken on issues of consent in a post-#MeToo world that follows Arabella, a writer who is sexually assaulted on a night out when her drink gets spiked.

Michaela, the show's creator, has spoken about her own experiences of being raped after having her drink spiked and says the show is ""not entirely fictional"".

Speaking to the Radio Times, Michaela said: ""This is a show about how trauma changes you, affects you, contorts you, suppresses you, reduces you, makes you explode, that's what it's about.""

The series will dig into consent with tact and is expected to be surprising in places too - as dark a topic as sexual assault is, Michaela writes in moments of comedy.

Other characters get a look-in too and their views of what consent means are examined.

The show is likely to receive critical acclaim for its skilful approach to a complex and painful subject matter.

Our relationship had been just friendship for months before we split, so when I started talking to a girl online – someone we both used to be at college with – I didn’t think she would mind.

Even so, I kept it quiet out of respect for her. One night, she went through my phone and saw my messages to this girl.

She went mad, asking how I could do this to her and demanding that I break off contact and block her on social media.

I agreed and told my new girl I couldn’t speak to her any more. She was really upset, and I realised I didn’t want to stop messaging.

We’ve since secretly met and kissed. I’m worried my ex – who suffers from depression – will find out.

The unidentified 36-year-old from the Minas Gerais region was ‘punished’ by the woman’s boyfriend and cousin after being accused of attacking her whilst drunk.

The two suspects have since been arrested, whilst the man was taken to hospital on April 19 where medics treated his horrific injuries.

Although he has given a statement to the Police, it is unclear whether he will be arrested and face charges for the alleged rape.

The offender allegedly got drunk in his home town of Olhos D'Agua and attempted to have sex with his niece.

She reportedly managed to fight off his advances and fled the scene before the accused then staggered home and went to sleep.

Reports suggest that instead of alerting the Police, the 20-year-old woman's boyfriend and his cousin were enraged and were determined to get revenge.

They proceeded to asked the man if he could join them in a nearby sugarcane field where they planned to neuter some pigs.

When the man turned up, the two men attacked him and, after beating him unconscious, they removed his trousers and proceeded to cut off his penis and testicles.

When he came round, the man was horrified by what had happened and managed to struggle home where he raised the alarm.

He was taken by ambulance to a hospital 50 kilometres (31 miles) from Olhos D'Agua where shocked medics were able to stop the bleeding and save his life.

Surgeons then struggled to reconstruct his urinary tract and said that there was no hope of replacing anything that he lost.

According to a local police officer, the force searched for the missing organ but did not find it - believing it had indeed been eaten by the animals.

Surgeon Felipe Lobo, who treated the man, said: ""It was like something out of a scene from a Dante novel.

“His penis and scrotum had been severed and his external genitalia were completely missing.

“All we could do was stem the bleeding, give him a blood transfusion and clean the wound.""

The man is now on antibiotics and will be able to leave the hospital in two to four days.

The veteran sleuth has been scouring the globe for Parle for two years to make him answer the charges against him – which include the murders of a child and an innocent young mum-of-three.

9 Digitally-aged images showing what Parle might look like now after 16 years on the run

Liam Kelly was just 16 when he was shot dead in Liverpool in 2004.

And 22-year-old Lucy Hargreaves was gunned down in her own home by a trio of masked killers a year later.

Cops believe Parle was involved in both killings and he'd even been arrested in connection with Liam's murder, but he was released on bail – and he's been on the run ever since.

Peter Bleksley, a former Met copper who was the star of Channel 4's Hunted, has now made it his mission to track Parle down and bring him to justice.

His podcast about the search, Manhunt: Finding Kevin Parle, has brought Parle's story to the attention of millions, throwing up new leads and sightings of the alleged killer.

And Bleksley's latest weapons in the hunt for Parle are computer-generated moving images of what the 40-year-old fugitive could look like today.

""Bit by bit, day by day, we're shrinking the world for Kevin Parle,"" Bleksley says.

""We're going to squeeze the globe so tightly that eventually, his six-foot-five ginger head pops up, and law enforcement can slap the handcuffs on him.""

Teen gunned down

Parle's alleged killing spree began with a bang in the dead of night.

Liam Kelly was getting out of a car in the early hours of June 19, 2004, when he was approached by two men – one of whom had a shotgun.

The teen was shot in the arm and chest – mortally wounded, he was able to drag himself to a nearby house to get help, but by the time paramedics arrived it was too late.

""A young man was denied the opportunity to grow, to mature, to enter manhood, to find a partner, to have a family,"" Bleksley rages.

""Nobody has described Liam to me as a model student – well, at 16, nor was I – but he was denied opportunity with his life so cruelly taken away from him.""

A 6 ft 5 man with ginger hair named Kevin Parle was arrested in connection with the crime, but he was bailed while police investigated an alibi which later turned out to be false.

In 2006, Anthony Campbell pleaded guilty to Liam's murder – in court, it was argued that Campbell was motivated by revenge after Liam threw a bicycle through a window at Campbell's aunt's house because Campbell hadn't paid him a £200 debt.

A second man, Peter Sinclair, also admitted a role in Liam's cold-blooded killing – he said he'd helped a third person involved in the murder by acting as a lookout while they burned clothing which might contain evidence.

Sinclair identified that person as Kevin Parle – who was already on the run.

Mum shot and burned

Between Liam's murder and one of his killers' conviction, another heinous crime rocked Liverpool – and would also end up being linked with Parle.

Lucy Hargreaves, 22, was lying on her living room sofa while her partner, Gary, was sleeping upstairs with their two-year-old daughter Faye.

Luckily, the couple's other two kids were away with relatives at the time of the attack August 3, 2005.

Three masked men stormed into the house and shot Lucy dead with a shotgun.

They then set about dosing the innocent mum-of-three's body with petrol before lighting it and dashing out the house.

Upstairs, Gary had been woken by Lucy's screams and the gunshots.

""Gary grabbed their child and escaped the inferno by smashing his way out of a first floor window and leaping to safety,"" Bleksley says.

""He then returned to the house and dragged Lucy's lifeless body from the blaze. A ghastly crime.""

Britain's most wanted fugitives Kevin Parle is the only person on the National Crime Agency's most wanted list who's believed to be involved in two separate murders. Some of the other criminals on the list include: Costas Sampson, convicted of raping a girl he met at a nightclub in London in February 2010.

Rezgar Zengana, convicted of posing as a private hire cab driver who picked up a woman and raped her in Glasgow in 2006.

Derek McGraw Ferguson, wanted in connection with the 2007 murder of Thomas Cameron in Glasgow.

Allan Foster, alleged to have murdered David 'Noddy' Rice in South Shields in 2006 along with being wanted for other offences relating to drugs and jewellery theft.

David Ungi, believed to be involved with the 2015 shotgun murder of Vinny Waddington in Liverpool.

Fatah Benlaredj, wanted for the rape of a seven-year-old girl in 2007.

Christakis Philippou, involved in a travel agency fraud which defrauded 20,000 people in the early 2000s selling cut-price holidays.

Sarah Panitzke, the only woman on the list, convicted in 2013 of laundering £1billion for a VAT fraud group.

Daniel Dugic, suspected of being involved in a conspiracy to import 225kg of cocaine into the UK in 2011.

Jonathon Kelly, wanted to be recalled to prison to serve the rest of his 10-year sentence after he ran while out on licence in 2014 – his violent crimes include paralysing one of his victims by stabbing them with a machete.

Bleksley says among Liverpool's underworld, there's a culture of ""you don't grass"", but this horrendous killing was different.

""Lucy's murder crossed the line,"" he says. ""It was just so abominable – an entirely innocent young woman, who's been described to me as being as beautiful on the inside as she was on the outside.""

Merseyside Police even described Lucy's murder as “one of

the most brutal and callous acts” they have dealt with.

Tony Downes and Kirk Bradley were charged with her murder in 2007 – in court, Gary said he believed he was the intended target of the attack because, in 1993, he'd been a passenger in a stolen car on a joy ride which resulted in a crash which killed Downes' three-year-old brother.

Downes and Bradley were acquitted of Lucy's murder, but went on to live a life of crime involving guns, grenades and violence – they were even sprung from a prison van by a gang of armed thugs in Manchester in 2011, but were later caught and imprisoned.

But at their trial for Lucy's murder, cops openly said they were trying to find a third man they believed was involved: Kevin Parle.

International manhunt

Since Parle escaped the clutches of Merseyside Police back in 2004, he's been on the run ever since – something which Peter Bleksley wants to bring to an end.

With his podcast and book, Manhunt: Hunting Britain's Most Wanted Murderer, Bleksley has spent the last 23 months searching for Parle all over the world.

Kirk Bradley, one of the men acquitted of Lucy's murder, was caught by a Dutch SWAT team in Amsterdam after he was busted out of a prison van in Manchester

Reported sightings of the fugitive have cropped in Ireland, Australia, Dubai and elsewhere.

Bleksley says the most recent credible sighting he knows of was in a town outside of Benidorm towards the end of 2019.

""I'm told from a source that I believe to be credible that officers from the National Crime Agency were taken to a caravan and camping site in Spain where Parle was actually pointed out to them as being on the opposite side of a bar,"" Bleksley says of another sighting.

""I'm told those officers said: 'We don't have the authority to arrest him.'

""Parle saw these officers and disappeared. There's been close shaves. He's lived a charmed life.""

Bleksley's podcast has been downloaded over three million times, and in December he gave a presentation to Merseyside Police officers about what he's discovered in his 23 months hunting Parle.

The force is also offering a £20,000 reward for any information which leads to Parle's arrest and there's now a European Arrest Warrant out for his capture.

But Bleksley is doing everything he can to smoke out Parle too – which is where the new CGI images come in.

""In early 2016, a reported sighting of Parle in Australia was made public,"" Bleksley says.

""As a result of that, Merseyside Police went to John Moores University in Liverpool and asked them, using computer graphics, to age the police mugshots they had of Parle to give an indication of how he might look in 2016.

""I've taken that a step further.""

Bleksley says he now has ""thousands"" of people helping his hunt – one of whom offered to make the digitally-aged mugshots come to life with movement.

They also added a beard, as Bleksley heard that Parle had grown one at some point while on the run.

It's hoped that the mocked up video images could lead to someone getting in touch who recognises Parle – although Bleksley does recognise his futuristic technique is right at the bleeding edge of investigative techniques.

""These are innovations which law enforcement haven't done yet,"" he says.

""But they might see some merit in it, and they might choose to do things like this in the future.""

Closing in

Bleksley knows detectives have their work cut out bringing Parle in after he's successfully evaded capture for over 16 years – but he remains optimistic they'll bag him.

The veteran detective says new information is coming in all the time – including a promising new lead this week – and he already has a list of 20 people to pay a visit to when travel restrictions allow him to do so.

""And believe you me,"" Bleksley says, ""They will not all be delighted to see me.""

Merseyside Police’s DCI Siobhan Garner offered reassurance to potential witnesses who might be wrestling with revealing what they know.

“I’d like to reassure them that there are special measures that we can put in place to protect witnesses in serious cases such as this,"" she said.

“Someone, somewhere can help us find justice for both of these victims, whose lives were callously cut short, and their families.”

The officer said she also believes Parle is overseas and revealed that he is now the subject of a European Arrest Warrant, a move which Peter hails as a ‘most important development’.

It means Parle can be detained by police forces across the EU, and handed over to British authorities to face trial in the UK.

Nikki Holland, director of investigations at the National Crime Agency, said: “Kevin Parle remains on our most wanted list and a subject of Operation Captura, a campaign which has so far led to the arrests of 85 out of 95 named fugitives.

“The NCA has a global reach and we do not give up. We are determined to do everything in our power to track down those outstanding, no matter how long it takes.”

But even if the breakthrough which finally nabs Parle doesn't come from one of Bleksley's enquiries, he's sure the fugitive will be made to stand trial eventually.

The 33-year-old Westworld actress took to Instagram in the early hours of Monday to reveal the identity of her alleged abuser.

She claimed: ""The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson.

""He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail.

""I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives.

""I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.""

18 Marilyn Manson denied any non-consensual relationships

Hours after she accused her ex of the abuse, Marilyn posted a statement on his Instagram denying the allegations.

He wrote: “Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.

“My intimate relationships have always been entire consensual with like-minded partners.

“Regardless of how - and why - others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.”

Hours after Evan’s statement was shared, another ex of Marilyn’s, Rose McGowan - who has been a leading voice in the #MeToo movement - publicly supported her on Twitter.

The Charmed actress wrote: “I stand with Evan Rachel Wood and other brave women who have come forward.

“It takes years to recover from abuse and I send them strength on their journey to recovery.

“Let the truth be revealed. Let the healing begin,” she said in a tweet.

Rose, 47, had a highly-publicized relationship for nearly four years in the late 1990's.

The pair was engaged for two years but split in 2001 over ""lifestyle differences.""

Evan and Marilyn, who is 19 years her senior, began dating in 2007.

The two then got engaged in 2010, but ended it seven months later.

She had met Marilyn when she was just 18 years old and he was 36 and married to Dita Von Teese.

Back in 2009, before their engagement ended, Marilyn was quoted by Spin saying of Evan: ""I have fantasies every day about smashing her skull in with a sledgehammer.""

However, when the comment was brought up in 2019, a rep for the singer said it was ""obviously a theatrical rock star interview promoting a new record, and not a factual account.""

According to Vanity Fair, Marilyn has also denied similar allegations in the past and his team has ""categorically denied"" the accusations in the past.

18 The two had been engaged for seven months Credit: Getty Images

Back in 2018, Evan stood up in front of a House Judiciary Subcommittee in an effort to get the Sexual Assault Survivors Bill of Right passed in all 50 states and said: ""My experience with domestic violence was this: Toxic mental, physical and sexual abuse which started slow but escalated over time, including threats against my life, severe gaslighting and brainwashing, waking up to the man that claimed to love me raping what he believed to be my unconscious body.""

During the #MeToo movement back in May 2018, a police report was filed against Marilyn citing sex crimes that took place in 2011.

The Los Angeles District's Attorney office announced in August that they were declining to pursue that case because of the lack of corroborating evidence.

Marilyn's attorney at the time, Howard E. King, told The Hollywood Reporter that the ""allegations made to the police were and are categorically denied by Mr. Warner and are either completely delusional or part of a calculated attempt to generate publicity….… Any claim of sexual impropriety or imprisonment at that, or any other, time is false.""

Evans joined four more women who called out the industrial metal singer on social media.

Photographer Ashley Walters claimed on Instagram: ""I continue to suffer from PTSD, and struggle with depression. I stayed in touch with quite a few people who went through their own traumas, under his control.

""As we all struggled, as survivors do, to get on with our lives, I’d keep hearing stories disturbingly similar to our own experiences. It became clear the abuse he’s caused; he continues to inflict on so many and I cannot stand by and let this happen to others. Brian Warner needs to be held accountable.""

Sarah McNeilly alleged: ""He (Brian Warner aka Marilyn Manson ) lured me in with ‘love bombing.’ Posing as the perfect boyfriend. Claiming he was just misunderstood.

""Charming, smart, funny, charismatic. As he was wooing me I would come to find out he was torturing others. Before long I was the one being tortured.

""I was emotionally abused, terrorized and scarred. I was locked in rooms when I was ‘bad,’ sometimes forced to listen to him entertaining other women. Kept away from certain friends or if I didn’t he would threaten to come after them.

""I was told stories of others who tried to tell their story and their pets ended up dead. I wasn’t allowed to go near other artists working on the same set, as he told me they had aids and were disgusting and if I did so he would be very upset and ‘I wouldn’t want that.’

""I was verbally berated for hours upon hours. Blamed for everything under the sun in order to make me feel worthless. Any male friends in my life were not allowed any longer. He threatened to shank one of them after they posted something on my Facebook page.

""I was thrown up against a wall and he threatened to bash my face in with the baseball bat he was holding, for trying to get him to pick out a pair of pants prior to a music video.

18 He had previously dated Rose McGowan Credit: Getty Images

""I witnessed him staging problems or hiding missing objects in order to justify his violent outbursts. I witnessed him recording others unknowningly in order to have blackmail on most anyone who entered ‘the meat locker’ (as I called his home, it was kept at a chilly 62 degrees always) I witnessed him terrorize and abuse others in my presence.

""Slander his exes. I have been afraid to bring any spotlight upon myself as to avoid winding up in his crosshairs again.

""As a result of the way he treated me, I suffer from mental health issues and PTSD that have affected my personal and professional relationships, self-worth and personal goals.

""I believe he gets off on ruining people's lives. I stand in support of all that have and all will come forward. I want to see Brian held accountable for his evil.""

Baroness Jones, who sits in the House of Lords, said in a debate on domestic violence that it could help cut down cases of discrimination too.

It comes after human remains were found last night in the case of Sarah Everard, who went missing after leaving a friends' house in Clapham last week.

Cops haven't yet confirmed it is her, but a serving Met Police cop has been arrested over her kidnap and murder.

Speaking in the House of Lords last night Baroness Jones said: ""In the week that Sarah Everard was abducted and, we suppose, killed — because remains have been found in a woodland in Kent — I argue that, at the next opportunity for any Bill that is appropriate, I might put in an amendment to create a curfew for men on the streets after 6pm.

""I feel this would make women a lot safer, and discrimination of all kinds would be lessened.""

She later admitted it wouldn't be a feasible idea in practise - but wanted to highlight it shouldn't be women who should be having to change their behaviour.

A Government source last night dismissed the suggestion as ""totally bonkers"". They said it would be a ""massive curtailing of basic freedoms and rights"" and would never work.

Caroline Nokes, Tory MP and Chair of the Women and Equalities Committee also said it was a mad suggestion.

She told The Sun: ""You can't go around slapping curfews on one gender.

""Any solution to the real fear that women feel is going to have to be a lot more complex than that.

""Its a bonkers suggestion - but it has got us all talking about what practical steps men can take to make women feel safer.""

Even the Women's Equality Party said it might not work.

Mandu Reid, Leader of the party said last night: “After a year of lockdowns, the last thing we need is more reasons to stop people going out.

""That’s why politicians and police should step up and take responsibility for making sure women can leave their homes free from the fear of violence. It’s about making ending violence against women a priority.”

Baroness Jones went on to back a cross-party bid to make misogyny and hatred against women a specific hate crime.

Baroness Jones said: ""If anyone is being advised to stay at home it should be men, not women.

“This kind of murder is rare, but very scary. What is far more regular are the sexual assaults, threats, intimidation, cat calling and rude remarks that women face every day.

“If the police did their job this misogynistic culture wouldn't thrive the way it has. Men wouldn't assume that they could get away with it. The police have failed on rape and sexual assault for years. They have mostly failed on domestic abuse. There needs to be some serious action at the Met to turn this around and give women the protection they deserve.

“We need to make misogyny a hate crime, as that would get the root of many of these other crimes.""

An amendment to the Domestic Abuse Bill - due to be debated in Parliament on Monday - would require all police forces in England and Wales to record where existing crimes have been motivated by hatred of someone’s sex or gender.

It comes as...

Sarah vanished last week as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham, South West London - and hasn't been seen since.

She left there around 9pm, phoned her boyfriend on the way, but is believed never to have arrived home.

PC Wayne Couzens, 48, was last night being held on suspicion of her abduction and murder.

The 48-year-old father-of-two is a Met Police armed diplomatic protection officer stationed in Westminster.

The Metropolitan Police last night confirmed human remains have been found in Ashford, Kent, but said they had not yet been identified.

It is 30 miles from the Deal home where Met Police gun cop was arrested on Tuesday night on suspicion of Sarah’s kidnap.

It's not believed the pair knew each other beforehand.

One line of inquiry is that he may have lured Sarah into his vehicle out of view of CCTV cameras.

His work saw him provide protection at major public events attended by senior members of the Royal Family.

It comes after thousands of women have taken to social media to share stories about how they too don't feel safe on Britain's streets.

A vigil is being held in Clapham, South London, at the weekend, for women to ""take back control"" of the streets, amid an outpouring of fear and emotion.

The head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick tried to reassure women last night it was still safe, but admitted people would be scared.

Shesaid: ""I know Londoners will want to know that it is thankfully incredibly rare for a woman to be abducted from our streets.

""But I completely understand that despite this, women in London and the wider public - particularly those in the area where Sarah went missing - will be worried and may well be feeling scared.""

This morning Home Secretary Priti Patel vowed to do more to make sure that women feel safe walking home.

The new accusation from Hayley Gripp comes as the disgraced Hollywood mogul, 69, is serving a 23-year prison sentence for rape charges.

10 Court documents filed on Friday detail Gripp's allegations Credit: Instagram / @itshayleygripp

The new Weinstein allegations are said to have happened in November 2012 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.

Court documents seen by The New York Post's Page Six – filed Friday in California Superior Court in Los Angeles – allege Gripp was told by a woman in the hotel to go to a hotel room to meet a ""big producer"" friend.

Gripp – then 19 years old – had told the woman she was waiting for a casting as she was working as a hair model, and opened up to the woman about her Tourette's syndrome.

Gripp said she reluctantly accepted, and was given a glass of wine once she got in the room.

Although she told the woman she was not yet 21, the woman allegedly said ""It's rude"" not to accept the offer.

After drinking half a glass of wine, Gripp allegedly suffered ""a brief blackout,"" court documents claim.

As she woke, the court documents claimed Weinstein's ""fingers were inside her vagina.""

The documents allege Weinstein ""held Ms. Gripp down with one hand, took Ms. Gripp’s genital fluids, and rubbed it on his exposed genitalia, proceeding to masturbate with his other hand.”

As Gripp tried to escape, she ""began flailing her arms"" and ""broke acrylic nail against the coffee table,"" the documents state, according to Page Six.

“Ms. Gripp then stabbed Weinstein on the bottom part of his scrotum with her sharp broken nail,"" the court papers allege.

Weinstein allegedly then ""let out a quiet scream"" and ""inadvertently"" caused her nail to dig ""deeper into his scrotum"" as he grabbed Gripp's hand, documents claim.

As Gripp got away while Weinstein went for a towel, the woman – who was apparently standing outside the hotel suite – allegedly told Gripp what happened in the room ""is your fault because of your Tourette syndrome"" and called her ""crazy.""

Imran H. Ansari, the ex-producer's attorney, told The Post that Weinstein ""categorically denies the allegations made against him in the complaint.""

Ansari added that Weinstein ""intends to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.""

One of Gripp's attorneys, Christa Riggins, told The Post that the Weinstein Accuser ""does not intent do file criminal charges"" as he serves out his charges for previous crimes and ""is unable to abuse other women.""

Riggins added to the outlet that Gripp will cooperate with investigations.

Gripp is seeking unspecified damages in the case.

Weinstein is currently serving a 23-year-sentence after he was convicted last year of raping an actress and sexually assaulting a former production assistant.

Earlier this year, a judge approved a settlement accepted by 83percent of Weinstein's nearly 40 accusers that will pay out $17million in damages.

Accusations first arose in 2017 dating back to 1970.

And spent years being baffled at what makes fiends like The Yorkshire Ripper, Anthony Hardy, and Rose and Fred West commit their chilling crimes.

Coming face to face with one of these killers and getting inside their mind is something most of us will never do.

But for Dr Richard Taylor, it is his bread and butter as a forensic psychiatrist.

He has spent his career finding out what is really going on inside the mind of a murderer.

From Camden Ripper Anthony Hardy to terrorist recruiter Hook, aka Abu Hamza, Dr Taylor has assessed some of the UK’s most dangerous criminals who kill.

'Slapped and punched' by criminals

Dr Taylor has got his fair share of cuts and bruises along the way from those he’s been trying to help - but he insists that it is his hard-working nurses who really bear the brunt of aggressive behaviour.

He said: “Nothing serious — but I’ve been slapped in the face, punched in the back and I was once chased down the corridor by a man who believed he was being spied on by pygmies.”

16 Dr Richard Taylor has sat opposite some of the UK's most notorious lags Credit: Olivia West - The Sun

But Dr Taylor isn’t interested in the whodunnit side of things, just whether the patient is mad or bad.

He said: “There are two issues, should the person be in hospital for treatment? And how will the court deal with them in terms of their offence level? So it does come down to: mad or bad.”

Here, in an interview with The Sun, Dr Taylor helps us to delve inside what really goes on inside a killer's mind and just what creates the perfect conditions for extreme violence.

Serial killers - rare but terrifyingly dangerous

Telly would have us believe that serial killers are everywhere.

But Dr Taylor says they are incredibly unusual - which is why they hit the headlines.

He said: “Serial killers are really rare. I’ve dealt with many cases, approaching 200, and I’ve only seen a handful of serial killers. It’s why they make headlines.”

Serial killers like The Fall’s Paul Spector, played by Jamie Doran, have multiple victims and stage the murder scene for police to find.

Dr Taylor said: “Serial killers are not spontaneous, they exhibit planned and calculated behaviour. They often have severely abnormal personality traits.

""They are typically psychopaths and/or sexual sadists with antisocial or severe narcissistic personality disorders.

“In other words, serial killers represent a very extreme subgroup of sexual killers.”

Examples of serial killers he has assessed include Anthony Hardy, aka The Camden Ripper, who killed at least three women and dismembered two of the bodies.

Dr Taylor was one of several psychiatrists who risk-assessed him after the first woman, a sex worker called Sally White, 38, but a botched pathology reporter gave her cause of death as a heart attack.

And he says men like Hardy build up to their killing sprees.

He explained: “They may have gradually escalated from other less serious sexual offences. The escalation involves fantasy and rehearsal.

""Fetish burglaries where underwear is interfered is the sort of crime they might start with. They don’t have to be intelligent, but the smarter they are the harder they are to catch.

The smarter they are, the harder they are too catch."" Dr Taylor on serial killers

“Staging of crime scenes is rare in most other types of murders but is not uncommon at crime scenes of serial killers where the staging may be related to repeating acts that were the subject of pre offence fantasy.

""The staging may have some symbolic meaning for the killer, for example a feeling of control associated with body mutilation. The taking of trophies allows the offence to be relieved later on.”

Sexual homicide: 'everyone's worst nightmare'

When a killing involves sex, the person behind it tends to have a severe personality disorder.

Within Dr Taylor’s career he has only seen a number of these “nightmarish murderers” who boast The Yorkshire Ripper, Anthony Hardy and the USA’s Ted Bundy and Ed Kemper in their ranks.

He said: “ Here we are talking about often men who have typically very severe personality disorders - such as psychopathy which means they have a sort of callous disregard for the effect of their behaviour on the victim.

“These are obviously horrific crimes particularly when it’s a male perpetrator and a female victim who they don’t know. These are sort of everyone’s worst nightmare and they are the subject of lots of movies but it is incredibly rare.”

Sexual killers can be split into two categories, organised and disorganised.

Dr Taylor says organised killers are predators who have planned out exactly what they want to do and will pick a victim that fits their fantasy.

These psychopaths are more likely to keep trophies to remember and re-experience their crime with. They also often have rituals, like the Yorkshire Ripper who removed all of his victims clothes after a murder.

Disorganised killers meet their victim by chance and spontaneously kill them without any forward thinking or planning. These killings can often happen after a rape in an attempt to conceal what has happened.

Dr Taylor said: “It’s essentially a rape and then the perpetrator is thinking ‘oh gosh how can I avoid being caught?’ and they kill the victim to cover up. It’s a bid to not be caught.”

Psychotic homicide: mad not bad

Dr Taylor mostly comes across people who have killed while suffering psychosis - a mental disorder which can cause people’s perceptions of reality to change dramatically.

He says: “This is someone who has delusions, hallucinations, they're in this sort of horror movie type world where they believe they are being threatened, it could be where their thoughts are being controlled. They’re hearing voices.

“For them it feels very real, it’s very upsetting and frightening and unfortunately, they can be very violent in that state and act in ways they wouldn’t normally.”

Some killers have delusions and hallucinations - they are in a horror movie type world where they believe they are being controlled. Dr Taylor

Examples of killers like this that Dr Taylor has encountered include Daniel Joseph who violently attacked and killed his friend Carla Thompson in a psychotic episode. He also attacked her neighbour, including stamping on her head, but did not kill her.

When arrested Joseph, who suffers from Bipolar disorder and had stopped taking his medication, was so violent that Dr Taylor required the assistance of riot police to sedate him to prevent harm to himself or anyone else.

“There are somewhere between 50 and 70 of those a year in the UK as a whole. That’s just goes to show the prevalence of mental illness in society. Seven to ten per cent of murders around the world are committed by the mentally ill.”

Often psychotic killers will be returned to a normal state through medication and therapy and become unable to cope with the crimes they have committed while severely unwell.

Can you forget a murder?

During his routine assessments after a murder, Dr Taylor often comes across killers who claim they have no memory of what happened.

The forensic psychologist says about 30 per cent of his cases will make this claim, often in a bid to try and stop being charged with the killing.

However, it unfortunately makes it almost impossible for them to mount a defence, so unsurprisingly a lot of murderers suddenly recall what happened.

Murder is a highly emotional event Dr Taylor

Dr Taylor said: “Sometimes they recover memory. Sometimes they don’t and there are various reasons for memory loss. Occasionally it can be real brain damage, it can be a very extreme form of alcohol blackouts but what is most common is dissociative amnesia.

“Murder is a highly emotional event and as such the brain can try and remove it, but of course, some killers are just lying because they think not remembering will give them some defence or it’s just too shameful to admit to.

“I saw a man called Dennis Costas who claimed he couldn’t remember setting his mistress on fire after dousing her in petrol. He was very drunk and he probably experienced an alcohol blackout of the entire day. It doesn’t really help the perpetrator to not remember”

Killing the one you love

Both women and men are capable of killing their intimate partners, but they each have different reasons for doing so. With women, like Sally Challen, who murdered her husband by hitting him 20 times with a hammer in 2010 , they are often the victims of a prolonged campaign of abuse - both mental and physical.

Dr Taylor said: “It’s a relatively small group but an important one. When these cases occur there are a lot of common themes.

""Typically very prolonged abuse, pretty severe abuse which is both physical and sexual. It’s often a snap decision when the abuse gets too much.

“One case like this saw a girl snap after her boyfriend called her a “whore who should open a brothel” in a voicemail to her mum. A snap decision saw her stab him to death after years of tolerating the behaviour.”

Men who kill their partners are often violent and possessive. Dr Taylor said: “There are very common features which are alcohol, jealousy, thoughts of infidelity, possessiveness and violence in the relationship.""

These men will often accuse their partner of infidelity, try and restrict their social life and may physically or mentally abuse their partners, like in the case of Ray Thompson.

Dr Taylor assessed Thompson after he had found out his estranged wife, Christine, was seeing another man. He offered to pick Christine up to take her shopping but instead he drove her to a secluded car park and murdered her by repeatedly stabbing her with an old bayonet.

Financially motivated

While it may be the resolution to many fictional whodunnits, in real life financial motives are rarely behind murders. In these cases the person is often prone to violence and the initial idea may not be to kill.

Dr Taylor said: “Often robberies gone wrong are in this category, someone comes home, gets in the way and gets killed. It’s very rare to see a family member scheme murder another for their inheritance, but to do so they’d have to be quite callous.”

One case Dr Taylor has worked on was that of fraudster Anand Varma, 26, who took out loans against his parents' house and in their names without their knowledge. After he was presumably confronted he killed his father.

Dr Taylor said: “On October 26, 2003, he strangled his father, 59-year-old Dinesh Varma, before packing his body in a suitcase and hiding the case in the boot of his car, which he left in a street not far from the family home.

""The day before the killing he had looked up the phrases “murder poison” and “murder kill” online. He then reported his father as a missing person.”

Gangs

Gang killings have been on the rise in the UK over the last decade and such murderers have a very different mindset to other killers. Dr Taylor: “Here we’re talking about postcode gang violence. Often it’s grudges, settling scores.

“We know that the adolescent brain is not as good at considering the consequences of decisions. I think there are young men that go out there not intending to kill.

“They think they’re just going to shank somebody and then, of course, you stick a knife in someone, it’s just a matter of luck if it goes into a leg muscle and it’s just bleeding or if you happen to hit a major vessel or organ and somebody can die very quickly.”

This is the case with many violent killings in London, such as with Jaden Moodie, 14, who was repeatedly stabbed by a rival gang member as part of a turf war. The teen was stabbed nine times in the hit and run attack.

Public Information Officer Jeff Lee from LAPD told The Sun: ""We had a shooting that took place at 1500 block of N Sierra Bonita Avenue at 9:40pm.

""Male unknown suspect fired a gunshot. Victim was male white 30 years of age.

""Victim was transported to local hospital in unknown condition. No arrest made yet.""

Shocking footage reveals the moment of the attack as Fischer screams for help.

Two men can be seen getting out out of a white car and moments later a gunshot can be heard.

Fischer can be heard screaming ""I've been shot, I'm bleeding out of my heart, of my lung, I'm bleeding out of my chest"".

He added: “They stole the dogs.”

Cops who arrived at the scene found him conscious but barely breathing, and he was transported to the hospital.

On March 29, Fischer announced he has been released from the hospital. He revealed his hospital stay was extended because one of his lungs kept collapsing, and he eventually had to have a part of it removed.

Two months after the incident, multiple people were arrested in connection to the dognapping of Lady Gaga’s two French Bulldogs, TMZ reported.

The culprits were booked on charges including attempted murder and theft. The names of the suspects have not been released.

On February 26, Los Angeles Police announced a woman brought the two dogs to the Olympic Community Police Station. The singer's representatives and detectives confirmed the dogs were indeed Gaga's, The Associated Press reported.

Capt. Jonathan Tippett said the woman who gave the dogs to police ""appears to be uninvolved and unassociated"" with the attack. It was unclear how the woman obtained the dogs.

Entertainment Tonight reported Dr Fred Pescatore, a close friend of Fischer, said the dog walker moved to Los Angeles from New York, four years ago specifically to walk Gaga's dogs.

He added that Fischer is ""amazing"" at his job and he ""would do anything"" for the dogs he cares for.

Pescatore revealed Fischer also walked Oprah Winfrey's dogs.

How many dogs does Lady Gaga have?

Lady Gaga has often shared with her fans adorable pics of her bulldogs on Instagram.

In one picture, the three Frenchies can be seen very comfortably laying on a sofa as Gaga poses.

In another one, the pop star can be seen carrying Koji, with the caption: ""Celebrating 'Rain On Me' with my little buddy KOJI. Miss my gurl Ari.""

The emergency order, which took effect early on Wednesday morning, directed all residents to vacate the area.

At least 31 people were arrested for ""failure to disperse, obstruction, assault, and unlawful weapon possession, police said.

The order stated that the Seattle Police Department received various reports of “narcotics use and violent crime, including rape, robbery, assault, and increased gang activity” within CHOP.

From June 2 to June 30, there was also a staggering 525 percent increase in violent crime compared to the same period last year.

This includes “22 additional incidents, in person-related crime in the area, to include two additional homicides, 6 additional robberies, and 16 additional aggravated assaults (to include 2 additional non-fatal shootings).”

A pervasive presence of firearms and other weapons has also been “well-documented”, according to the executive order.

There are two fatal shootings on June 20 and June 29, which resulted in the death of two African American teens.

In the first shooting, teenage rapper Lorenzo Anderson, 19, was fatally shot – but cops and firefighters were blocked from helping him by angry crowds.

During an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, his father, Horace Lorenzo Anderson was asking for answers.

""It's been almost two weeks and I haven't heard from nobody.""

""They wouldn't even let me see my son that night, it took a whole week before I saw my son I went to the hospital and they said we wouldn't see him.""

Anderson then broke down in tears and begged: ""Somebody need to come tell me something, cos I still don't know nothing and somebody needs to come to my door and tell me something.

""All I know is my son got killed up here... that's my son.""

A friend claimed that Mays Jr had hijacked a Jeep and drove with his friend into the zone ""for safety.""

Ciara Walker, 25, told the Daily Mail that she was on the phone with the boys when the incident occurred: ""The last thing I heard was a crash and pop pop pop, I'm not sure who said what, but one of them said, 'Ah s**t I'm hit, I don't wanna die.' Then the phone went dead.""

Mayor Durkan also mentioned that conditions in the CHOP and lack of social distancing rules put in place to ward off COVID-19 could contribute to the rise in the numbers of cases across the region.

Following the news that area had been cleared out, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany called it a ""failed four-week Democrat experiment.""

The Israeli government has very strict rules regarding gun ownership.

But that hasn't stopped Julie from regularly promoting female empowerment while wielding giant weapons.

She runs an online gun accessories store, and wants the government to loosen rules, to allow more women in her country to legally carry a gun to protect themselves.

Julie said she was inspired to help others after her devastating experiences.

She explained: ""I've been a rape victim twice in my life, the first time was at the age of eight; I was sexually abused by an older man.

""It affected me so much that I lost all my confidence and became scared of everything.

“I turned into a really quiet child with few friends and I was always suspicious of adults, I had no trust in them.""

Years later when she was 15 years old, Julie became the victim of rape again – this time allegedly at the hands of a boyfriend, who was 18.

She said: ""After that happened, I did everything I could to avoid him.

“I became depressed and stayed at home, I struggled with school, it affected every part of my life.”

The then-teen was so traumatised that she felt unable to report the alleged crime to cops at the time.

It wasn't until years later that Julie started talking to family and friends about the assaults - but she was upset that some did not support her.

She has since undergone therapy, which she says has helped massively in coming to terms with the sexual abuse.

Julie joined the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) at 18, where she eventually served for three years as a combat soldier in the Search and Rescue unit.

She learnt how to shoot a gun, and protect herself, undergoing Krav Maga training - a tough military self-defence and fighting regime.

Julie said: ""I fell in love with tactical training, weapons and self-defence, and I felt empowered for the first time.

“I became my own defender, protector, I stood up for myself, I found my voice and I’m now more outspoken.”

After leaving the IDF, Julie continued to take self defence classes and used her social media platforms to raise awareness of how women can learn to defend themselves.

HOW YOU CAN GET HELP: Women's Aid has this advice for victims and their families: Always keep your phone nearby.

Get in touch with charities for help, including the Women’s Aid live chat helpline and services such as SupportLine.

If you are in danger, call 999.

Familiarise yourself with the Silent Solution, reporting abuse without speaking down the phone, instead dialing “55”.

Always keep some money on you, including change for a pay phone or bus fare.

If you suspect your partner is about to attack you, try to go to a lower-risk area of the house – for example, where there is a way out and access to a telephone.

Avoid the kitchen and garage, where there are likely to be knives or other weapons. Avoid rooms where you might become trapped, such as the bathroom, or where you might be shut into a cupboard or other small space. If you are a ­victim of domestic abuse, SupportLine is open Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 6pm to 8pm on 01708 765200. The charity’s email support ­service is open weekdays and weekends during the crisis – messageinfo@supportline.org.uk. Women’s Aid provides a live chat service available. from 10am to noon. You can also call the freephone 24-hour ­National Domestic Abuse Helpline on 0808 2000 247.

But she's worried that it's harder for females to protect themselves because of Israel's strict gun rules.

Currently, veterans of the IDF’s infantry units are eligible for gun permits, along with cops who have received the equivalent training.

Julie claims that getting a gun is much easier for men who have served as combat soldiers and did basic training.

Yet women who have almost the same combat experience have to go further to prove their capabilities.

She said: ""I was able to get one because I served three years as a combat soldier and then became a shooting instructor, but it was a long and difficult process.

“First we have to go through a range of officers courses, then wait for one year and just then we can do a shooting instructors course but only if we work in a shooting range.”

Julie wants more women in Israel – and throughout the world – to be able to protect themselves amid increasing rates of violence in Israel, particularly amid the coronavirus lockdown.

She said: ""My country is also facing many terror attacks and women should be able to defend themselves.

“When I walk out of my home with a gun, I feel safe and protected and I want other women to feel the same way, to feel empowered and confident and to be able to stand up for themselves.”

His beef with Tupac and fiery rhetoric catapulted him into the annals of hip-hop - here's everything you need to know about the late American rapper.

Who was Notorious B.I.G?

Christopher Wallace was born in Brooklyn, New York, on May 21, 1972.

Better known as his stage names The Notorious B.I.G. and Biggie Smalls, Christopher is still ranked as one of the most influential rappers of all time.

Notorious B.I.G. released his debut album, Ready to Die, in 1994 - and soon became a central figure on the East Coast hip hop scene.

At the time, West Coast hip hop was still dominant in the mainstream charts.

Notorious B.I.G. became heavily involved in a East Coast-West Coast hip hop feud. Tupac Shakur was also a key player, on the West Coast side.

Notorious B.I.G. married R&B singer Faith Evans in August 1994, just weeks after meeting at a Bad Boy photo shoot.

The turbulent marriage was cut short less than three years later, when Notorious B.I.G. was shot in a drive-by shooting.

A tribute single called I'll Be Missing You - released in 1997 by Puff Daddy, 112 and Faith - won a Grammy award.

When did Notorious B.I.G. die?

Notorious B.I.G. was shot dead in Los Angeles on March 9, 1997.

Spookily his next album, called Life After Death, was scheduled to be released on March 25.

He was only 24 years old when he was killed and the murder is still unsolved.

The driver of a dark Chevrolet Impala SS, dressed in a suit and bow tie, pulled up alongside Notorious B.I.G's SUV at a red traffic light at 12.45am and began shooting at the rapper's car.

Notorious B.I.G. was shot four times, and died in hospital at 1.15am.

Just six months earlier, Tupac had been killed in very similar circumstances.

What happened to Notorious B.I.G's car? The car in which Notorious B.I.G. was fatally shot was put up for auction, with seller of the BMW SUV supposedly seeking £1.25 million. The vehicle was originally purchased at auction by an unknown woman in October 1997. She was unaware of its dark history, and had been using it to drive her family of six around. After Biggie's death, police replaced the bullet holes on the passenger side before selling the vehicle.

How is his death connected to P. Diddy?

New revelations and witness statements state P. Diddy was the original target of the shooter and Biggie may have been killed by mistake.

Leaked FBI documents reveal Sean ""Puffy"" Combs aka P. Diddy had received multiple death threats and his security guard confronted a man who had approached Combs' car just moments before the shooting.

Both rappers had been waiting for cars to pick them up outside the Peterson Automotive Museum in LA after an after-party.

The pair both got into the front passenger's seats of their respective green SUVs.

Combs' security guard told his driver to run a red light rather than stopping at a junction, knowing they wouldn't have been safe to sit at the lights.

Biggie's driver however didn't follow suit and they sat at the lights for around a minute.

The fact that it took a minute for the shooter to make the hit indicates they were hesitant, perhaps due to identity confusion.

Those close to Biggie say if someone had wanted to take him out they could have done it much more easily at any other time as he often went out in public without security, to go for food, the cinema or even to the mall.

Was the murder orchestrated by the LAPD?

An ex-FBI agent says he has evidence that the Los Angeles Police Department orchestrated Biggie's murder.

Philip Carson claims to have evidence against two ""dirty"" cops and the LAPD could now face a $500million lawsuit.

He says bosses shut down his investigation, but when he retired in 2016 he took almost 3,000 pages of case documents with him.

Carson gave his evidence to filmmakers and a film about the case called City of Lies starring Johnny Depp is being released shortly.

He said: “LAPD, all the way to the very very f***ing top, knew exactly what was going on.""

Carson believes that Marion ""Suge"" Knight, the former CEO of Death Row Records who signed rappers including Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg and Tupac, employed the LAPD cops and ordered them to arrange Wallace’s murder.

How is his death connected to Tupac?

In June 1996, Tupac released a song called Hit 'Em Up - claiming he had had sex with Faith, who was pregnant with Notorious B.I.G's second child at the time.

Just three months later, Tupac was shot multiple times in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas, on September 7.

He died in hospital on September 13 - and it wasn't long before people started accusing Notorious B.I.G. of having something to do with it.

Both murders remain unsolved, and shrouded in conspiracy theories.

How did Notorious B.I.G's name live on after death?

Notorious B.I.G's double-disc album was released 16 days after his death - and rose straight to No1 in the US album charts.

It only reached 23 in the UK Album charts.

Life After Death was certified as Diamond in 2000, one of the only hip hop albums to receive this certification.

Two more albums have been released since his death, and Notorious B.I.G. has 17 million sales in the US.

Cops were called to West Green Road in Tottenham at 4pm yesterday, just weeks after a 17-year-old was stabbed to death on the same road.

Cops tonight named the victim of the weekend's attack as 21-year-old Tyreke Watson.

Neighbour Wole Larose said Tyreke died outside a halfway house where he had been staying.

He said: “I was sleeping upstairs and heard people talking and some shouting.

“I came down and saw him lying on the floor face up, just outside the building.

""He seemed like a nice guy, but I didn’t really speak to him to be honest.”

Mark Best, 36, who lives up the road said: ""I heard someone crying really loudly. Whoever it was sounded pretty distraught.

“I could see someone was being attended to on the ground.

“There was an ambulance at the end of the road which was blocking my view, but I could see someone was being patched up.

“Moments later I saw a paramedic open up a red blanket so either they were shielding the view or someone had passed away.

“It’s the second fatality to happen within a month. There are still flowers at his memorial across the road, less than 50 yards away.

“I was shocked that it was so close to my front door, at the end of my street.

“But having lived in London for most of my life, these things happen too often.""

Detective Chief Inspector Linda Bradley, leading the investigation, said: “This is a fast-paced investigation and my team of detectives is determined to locate and arrest those responsible for the fatal stabbing.

“Tyreke’s family have been left completely devastated by his death and I would urge anyone who witnessed the attack or who has any other information about this case to contact police.”

Detective Chief Superintendent Treena Fleming, local police commander for Haringey, said: ""I am deeply saddened by the death of another young man as the result of a senseless stabbing on the streets of Haringey.

""My thoughts and sympathies lie with the family and loved ones of the young man at this very difficult and traumatic time.

""Homicide detectives are working incredibly hard alongside local officers to understand what happened yesterday afternoon and to identify and apprehend those responsible as soon as possible.

""If you witnessed what happened, or have any information about the murder, then I would urge you to get in contact and tell us what you know.

“Over the next few days you will see increased police patrols and weapon sweeps in the area to provide reassurance to our communities.

""If you know someone who has access to a knife, or habitually carries one, then please tell us so that we can act now to prevent any further mindless violence.”

One witness described seeing Tyreke being chased by a “short lad” before he was stabbed after being ambushed as he came out of a Cash Converters shop.

They told the Evening Standard: ""The guy came out of Cash Converters and a tiny lad, really short, started chasing him.

""They were running around a car then the little guy, probably a teenager, must have stabbed the older guy. He staggered across the street to a doorway to a building where he lived and collapsed.”

He added: “I have seen the victim around. He was a nice enough lad. He had only moved here recently.

“The victim’s mother turned up soon after. She wanted to see her son, but the paramedics were stopping her so they could treat him. She was hysterical.”

A crime scene remains in place and the man's next of kin have been informed.

'A COOL GUY'

A young woman, who knew Tyreke, said: ""He was a cool guy and liked talking to girls, but he also seemed very depressed.”

Jessica Lopes, 21, a psychological student at Goldsmith University, who was out walking her dog 15 minutes after the murder happened, described the aftermath.

She said: ""There was an ambulance and a couple of police cars.

“They had taken out a bed so I guess they were trying to help him. There was a woman on the floor with him and she put a red blanket on him.

“I heard a couple of people screaming 'oh no', so maybe they knew him. That door is always open, so maybe he ran in there to get help or something.

“Another kid got stabbed just up the road, it’s crazy. It’s scary because it happened in broad daylight. It could happen anytime any place and I go walk my dog three four times a day.”

No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.

It comes just five weeks after student Anas Mezenner, 17, was stabbed to death on West Green Road on January 19, shortly after 9pm.

9 Two people were stabbed on the same road just weeks apart

Another boy, also 17, had non life-threatening stab injuries at the time.

A friend said Anas, a keen gamer and Liverpool fan, had been attacked after confronting muggers who stole another friend’s phone.

Anas's mum said: ""He did not deserve this at all. He was a lovely boy.

""He was studying media at the moment, but he wanted to be a pilot.

""He was very academic at school. He got all his GCSEs.""

Five teens aged 14 to 17 have been charged with Anas’ murder and will stand trial on a date to be confirmed.

The man, aged in his 40s, is being held on suspicion of sexual activity with a child when in a position of trust, and misconduct in a public office.

His arrest comes after a fresh investigation was launched into child sex exploitation during 2004 and 2005, and into the abuse and death of 15-year-old Victoria Agoglia, MEN reports.

A damning report in January revealed children were raped and abused by up to 100 members of a Manchester grooming gang - despite police and social workers knowing what was happening.

The suspect is employed by Manchester City Council's Children Social Care but has currently been suspended.

Police confirmed he has been released on bail pending further enquiries.

The report centred on the death of Victoria Agoglia, 15, from a heroin overdose in 2003.

She repeatedly told carers she was being injected with the drug and raped by a 50-year-old man — but they failed to act.

A police probe into her death, called Operation Augusta, revealed at least 57 more victims and 97 suspects.

But it was shut down in 2005 due to “fundamental” resourcing flaws.

Last year former staff assistant Tara Reade filed a sexual assault complaint against Biden and accused him of attacking her in the Senate corridor in 1993.

Biden has categorically denied this, saying ""it never happened.""

Cuomo has been accused of sexual harassment by three women – including two members of his staff – but has denied any inappropriate behavior and ordered an independent investigation into the allegations.

During Maher's and Charlamagne's discussion they focused on the topic of whether Cuomo should resign.

Maher insisted the governor doesn't need an investigation into the sexual harassment claims raised against him by three women, including two former staffers.

Despite saying he believed those women, Maher claimed ""it’s always on a case-by-case basis.""

Charlamagne responded by saying it’s ""kinda hard"" to call for Cuomo’s resignation when ""you voted for Joe Biden.""

He continued ""If you weren’t more upset with Joe Biden, who had more serious allegations...""

""No, he didn’t!"" Maher said. ""Yeah, he was accused of actual rape,"" said Charlamagne.

""No, he wasn’t,” said Maher. ""What are you talking about?!"" Charlamagne gasped. ""Tara Reade!""

""Are you talking about the hallway incident?” Maher asked. ""Well, I don’t believe that,"" he said.

""That’s what I’m saying. Some I believe, some I don’t. That’s my right. I don’t believe her. These women I believe completely. I don’t think that Joe Biden is the guy who finger-b****s you in the hallway. I don’t. I just don’t.""

Speaking about Reade's allegations Charlamagne said, regardless of whether they believe her on not, they were ""more serious"" than Cuomo’s and yet ""I didn’t hear people asking him to resign or drop out of the race.""

""That’s when he was sniffing their hair,"" Maher said ""The first allegation was just…it wasn’t even a MeToo, even though it was interpreted that way in the press. It was just he was just trying to do an old-man thing.""

""Hey man, harassment is harassment,"" Charlamagne replied. ""No, it’s not,"" argued Maher.

""I don’t think we can tell women the difference between sniffing hair and saying something inappropriate because I think sniffing hair is just as inappropriate as saying something,"" Charlamagne said.

Maher then said Biden was ""just trying to show [Lucy Flores] encouragement.""

""She was just about to make a speech, he came up behind her just to be like, ‘You’re going to do good out there, honey,'” Maher explained. ""Let’s not pretend that we live in this world where all these things are the same.""

Eventually the pair agreed as Charlamagne finally said ""I agree with that.""

Last April Biden's former staffer, Tara Reade, accused him of assaulting her in the basement of an office building in Washington, D.C. in 1993.

Let’s not pretend that we live in this world where all these things are the same. Bill Maher

She claimed the alleged assault happened while she was working as a staff assistant in Biden’s office at the time, when he was a senator for Delaware.

Joe Biden had explicitly denied the allegations and said the accusations ""absolutely did not happen,"" in a statement in May.

Bennett has accused Cuomo of sexual harassment claiming he quizzed her about her sex life after she went to him for help as a survivor of sexual assault.

Her claims came three days after Lindsey Boylan, a former aide to the governor, claimed Cuomo kissed her on the lips and suggested they play strip poker.

A third woman, Anna Ruch, accused him of touching her bare lower back, grabbing her cheeks and asking to kiss her at a wedding in September 2019.

More than any other factor, Labour’s shocking patriotism deficit is the reason the party enters 2020 looking like it is ready to be put out for the binmen of history.

Writing in the New Statesman, Labour MP Liam Byrne recalled how the party’s institutionalised loathing of this country went down on the doorstep during the General Election.

He wrote: “One man told me he saw our leader [Jeremy Corbyn] as a ‘communist terrorist sympathiser’ who wouldn’t push the nuclear button, sing the National Anthem or stand up to the Russians, even when their spies poisoned our citizens in Salisbury. On door after door, we heard similar views.”

Sounds like fair comment.

But there was a time when a proud Labour man was at least as patriotic as any Tory.

“I could use a bayonet, a rifle, a revolver,” Labour legend Tony Benn recalled of his service in World War Two.

“And if I’d seen a German officer having a meal, I’d have tossed a grenade through the window.”

Tony Benn was as hard Left as it ever gets.

BENN'S BLUEPRINT

But there was one crucial difference between Benn and Corbyn, John McDonnell and the Marxist muppets of Momentum.

Tony Benn loved this country.

Benn was the most eloquent advocate of leaving the European Union that the UK ever had, saying that to be an elected British MP travelling to Brussels in 1974 made him feel like “a slave to Rome”.

More important than his loathing of the EU, Benn was prepared to fight, kill and die for this country.

A member of the Home Guard at 16, Benn later became an RAF pilot, like his father and his elder brother Michael, who was killed during the war.

So you can disagree with Tony Benn’s hard-Left politics.

But nobody could ever doubt his devotion to this country.

Benn’s unapologetic patriotism has disappeared from the Labour Party of today and with it any chance of Labour winning a general election any time soon.

Ambitious Labour MPs are aware that their next party leader will fare no better than Magic Grandad if they are openly sympathetic to terrorist organisations like Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA.

And so you get Rebecca Long-Bailey droning in a voice like a general anaesthetic that Labour needs a “progressive patriotism” if they want to win back all those working-class voters who just went Tory for the first time in their lives.

Progressive patriotism? What’s that when it’s at home, Rebecca?

Long-Bailey has built her career cravenly backing the likes of Corbyn and McDonnell — extremist politicians who have spent a lifetime sucking up to terrorists who despise this country.

So it is a bit rich to see Rebecca paying lip service to patriotism — progressive or otherwise — this late in the day.

Labour have spent so long spitting poison at anyone who loves this country that when drivel about “progressive patriotism” comes from their flapping cakeholes, it sounds like they are faking it.

BRITS ARE PROUD

Labour simply don’t get it.

Patriotism is not some meaningless political posture, a manifesto pledge to be tossed aside later.

Patriotism is real, and it matters to millions, and we feel it in our blood and bones.

Most of us have parents, grand-parents or great-grandparents who lost their youth to the great conflicts of the last century.

Millions of us believe that we are blessed to call this country our home.

We are proud of our history and forever grateful to the generations who came before us and who paid for our freedoms with their sacrifice.

We see British history as something to be proud of — not to apologise for!

Is that kind of patriotism “progressive” enough for speaking clock Rebecca Long-Bailey?

Probably not.

At their party conference in 2018, Labour delegates enthusiastically waved hundreds of Palestinian flags.

Would Labour ever wave the Union Jack with the same passion?

I suspect that the caring comrades would rather slash their wrists.

Poor choices IN 120 years, Labour have never had a woman leader. And although most of the possible replacements for Corbyn are female – Lisa Nandy, Emily Thornberry, Yvette Cooper, Jess Phillips, Rebecca Long-Bailey – the party seem certain to choose another mediocre male. The bookies have Sir Keir Starmer as favourite to step into Corbyn’s sandals. Sir Keir would be the first party leader with a title since 1963. That should win back the working class

Cypriot shame of 'rape teen bullying'

THE British teenager allegedly gang-raped in Cyprus has been bullied by everyone.

She has been bullied by the thuggish Cypriot police who, during a seven-hour interrogation, terrorised her into retracting her original allegation of rape without the presence of a lawyer (or even a tape recorder), then charged her with lying.

She has been bullied by the wickedly biased justice system of Cyprus, where a judge angrily dismissed any evidence that helped her case, then found her guilty of causing “public mischief”.

She has been bullied by the Israeli teenagers who she claims raped her, louts who gleefully chanted: “The Brit is a whore!” when they returned to Tel Aviv to sip champagne with their delighted parents.

And the 19-year-old has been bullied by Cyprus itself, so pathetically desperate to suck up to its powerful ally Israel.

Days after the teenager was convicted, Cyprus and Israel signed a billion-dollar gas pipeline deal.

The Israeli youths – and their parents – apparently have friends in some very high places, including the Israeli government and the mayor’s office in Jerusalem.

While they strut free and obscene videos of the girl appear online, she endures post-traumatic stress disorder, suffers nightmares and hallucinations and has lost her place at university because she cannot leave Cyprus.

On Tuesday she will be sentenced and faces being sent to a Cypriot jail.

The UK needs to stand up for this vulnerable British national in her hour of need.

Cyprus is proving itself a safe space for rapists.

I would rather have a fortnight in Syria.

9 Little Mix’s Jade Thirlwall went to a New Year’s do as Whitney Houston

WHEN Elvis impersonators do their impressions of The King, they never try to be the hip-shaking 21-year-old Memphis Flash.

No, they always impersonate fat Elvis, sad Elvis, the Elvis who died on a toilet at the age of 42.

But when Little Mix’s Jade Thirlwall went to a New Year’s do as Whitney Houston, she channelled Whitney in her glorious prime – young, fresh, Bodyguard-era Houston, about to be swept up in Kevin Costner’s arms.

Good for her. Young Whitney is definitely harder to pull off than old Elvis.

One way traffic WITH Brexit looming at the end of January, people smugglers have been ramping up illegal traffic across the Channel with the lie that the UK will “close” after we officially leave the EU. Sixty people were rescued from the Channel on Boxing Day, 43 were saved off the coast of Dover on New Year’s Eve, including eight children. In 2018, 586 souls were fished from small boats or the freezing sea attempting to get from France to England. Last year, the number shot up to 2,358 – a rise of 300 per cent. So to all those who still talk as if leaving the EU will be the death of us, I ask: Anyone been caught trying to sneak out of the UK and into France? No, I didn’t think so.

Effie - who declined to give her surname - claimed in a tearful press conference on Thursday that Armie beat her and held her hostage.

Elizabeth, who split from Armie last summer, is said to be trying to shield their kids from the latest allegations made against her ex.

A source told ET: ""Elizabeth is horrified to hear the most recent allegations against Armie.

""Her number one priority is her kids and she wants to make sure that her children feel loved and taken care of during all of this.""

The exes, who announced in July 2020 that they were divorcing after 10 years of marriage, have two children: daughter Harper, six, and son Ford, four.

Elizabeth, 38, opened a bakery in Colorado this week but has been living in the Cayman Islands during the pandemic.

Armie has denied Effie's rape allegation and maintains that the relationship was consensual.

His attorney, Andrew Brettler said: ""From day one, Mr. Hammer has maintained that all of his interactions with [the accuser] - and every other sexual partner of his for that matter - have been completely consensual ... and mutually participatory.""

He added: ""[The accuser's] attention seeking and ill-advised legal bid will only make it more difficult for real victims of sexual violence to get the justice they deserve.""

Effie said in the conference: ""I met Armie Hammer on Facebook in 2016 when I was 20 years old, I fell in love with him instantly.""

She then went on to claim that Hammer raped her in Los Angeles, ""during which he repeatedly slammed my head against a wall bruising my face.""

She also alleged that the actor whipped her feet with a crop so they would hurt for days afterwards.

Effie alleged: “He committed other acts of violence against me to which I did not consent.

“For example he beat my feet with a crop so they would hurt with every step I took for the next week.

""During those four hours, I tried to get away but he wouldn't let me.”

Her attorney Gloria Allred later claimed that there are photographs of Effie's ""visible injuries.""

Effie shared a photograph of herself and Armie Hammer, which Allred claims was taken ""prior to the incident that she alleges.""

Sobbing, Effie went on to claim: ""I thought he was going to kill me.""

She alleged that she has ""lived in fear"" of the actor and ""lost interest in living.""

""I could not comprehend or over come what he did to me,"" Effie claimed.

Following the press conference, the Los Angeles Police Department launched a sexual assault investigation.

Armie has been in the spotlight after a series of graphic texts, allegedly between him and several women, showed him talking about drinking their blood, describing scenes of sexual control, and references to cannibalism.

In one message, Armie allegedly describes himself as “100% a cannibal” and tells a woman “I want to eat you.”

Earlier this month, Armie's ex-girlfriend Paige Lorenze, 24, said in an explosive interview with Vanity Fair that during their relationship she felt “really unsafe and sick to her stomach.""

She added: ""He told me that I couldn’t have anyone else in my bed. And then I just started to feel really unsafe and really sick to my stomach about things. I was also emotionally dependent on him.""

The article, published on March 11, 2021, claimed the actor's ex-partners have ""compared him to Ted Bundy"" and said he was obsessed with Shibari – a Japanese bondage art form in which people are tied up in intricate patterns.

Paige, who was in a relationship with Armie for four months late last year, also claimed that he wanted to eat her body parts.

12 Another ex, Courtney Vucecovich, claimed he wanted to barbecue her ribs Credit: Facebook

She alleged he was obsessed with ""meat, bones and veins,"" and wanted her to be proud of the bruises she sustained as a result of rough BDSM sessions.

Paige even alleged that Armie was into 'knife play' and carved the letter 'A' into her skin above her pubic bone before licking the bloody wound and ""bragging"" about it to his friends.

Another ex-girlfriend, Courtney Vucekovich, said he spoke to her about the bondage, stating he never tied up a human before and instead ""only mannequins.""

Armie, who was recently replaced by Josh Duhamel in Jennifer Lopez's upcoming film Shotgun Wedding, previously responded to the eye-opening claims.

Ivan Roca, a member of the opposition right-wing Chilean Independent Democratic Union party, made the comments as part of a statement in defence of his son Jurgen Roca Aguayo, after he was remanded in custody accused of raping a girl.

After anger erupted online in response to his statement, the councillor of Lota, Chile, then went on to say it was a ""shame that it was always the man that paid the price"".

He added that while visiting his son in prison, he had formed the opinion it was a ""tragedy"" there were so many young men in there for the same reason.

Mr Roca decided to take to Facebook to address all parents of young girls, placing the blame on them for when people like son get accused of rape.

In the post, that has now gone viral, the councillor claims that despite her age the girl had a ""woman's body"" and that the parent of young girls ""must control"" their children better.

He appeared to be suggesting that young women should by chaperoned, saying that only with parents acting to carefully control them could ""family suffering"" be avoided.

The politician concluded that parents who do not follow this advice should be condemned for their own bad choices, and regarded as irresponsible

The ex-vice president of UDI, Isabel Pla Jarufe, responded to her former colleague's post stating: ""He has a public responsibility as an official and his statements are unacceptable.

""He has attempted to make his 33-year old son a victim in a case where he raped a 12-year old girl.""

In response to pressure from the public and other politicians, Mr Roca attempted to clarify his comments - saying his words had been ""taken out of context"".

He said he did not mean to say young girls should be ""controlled"", he meant they should be ""guided"".

The councillor told Eldesconcierto: ""It's a shame what happened to my son, I just visited him in jail and it was full of young men just like him, detained for being with minors without thinking of the consequences beforehand.

""This feels very wrong to me regardless of whether the minor appeared older or not.""

Speaking to the media outlet, Mr Roca continued to question the parents of young girls who he held responsible for letting their daughters meet older men and ""behave irresponsibly"".

OPRAH: We can’t hug, everybody is double- masked and has face shields. You look lovely. Do you know if you’re having a boy or a girl?

Meghan: We do this time. I’ll wait for my husband to join us and we can share that with you.

Oprah: That would be really great. Before we get into to it, I just want to make clear to everybody that, even though we’re neighbours, I’m down the road, you’re up the road, we’re using a friend’s place. There has not been an agreement, you don’t know what I’m going to ask, there is no subject that’s off limits and you are not getting paid for this interview.

Meghan: All of that’s correct.

Oprah: I remember sitting in the chapel — thanks for inviting me, by the way. I so recall this sense of magic. I never experienced anything like it. When you came through that door, you seemed like you were floating down the aisle. Were you even inside your body at that time?

Meghan: I’ve thought about this a lot. It was like having an out-of- body experience I was very present for. The night before, I slept through the night entirely, which is a bit of a miracle, and then woke up and started listening to Going To The Chapel, to make it fun and light and remind ourselves this was our day. We were both aware in advance of that this wasn’t our day, this was the day planned for the world.

Oprah: Everybody who gets married knows you’re really marrying the family. But you weren’t just marrying a family, you were marrying a 1,200-year-old institution, you’re marrying the monarchy. What did you think it was going to be like?

Meghan: I would say I went into it naively because I didn’t grow up knowing much about the Royal Family. It wasn’t part of something that was part of conversation at home. It wasn’t something that we followed. My mum even said to me a couple of months ago, ‘Did Diana ever do an interview?’ Now I can say. ‘Yes, a very famous one’, but my mum doesn’t know that.

Oprah: But you were aware of the royals and, if you were going to marry into the royals, you’d do research about what that would mean?

Meghan: I didn’t do any research about what that would mean.

Oprah: You didn’t do any research?

Meghan: No. I didn’t feel any need to, because everything I needed to know he was sharing with me. Everything we thought I needed to know, he was telling me.

Oprah: So, you didn’t have a conversation with yourself, or talk to your friends about what it would be like to marry a prince, who is Harry, who you had fallen in love with . . . you didn’t give it a lot of thought?

Meghan: No. We thought a lot about what we thought it might be. I didn’t fully understand what the job was: What does it mean to be a working royal? What do you do? What does that mean? He and I were very aligned on our cause- driven work, that was part of our initial connection. But there was no way to understand what the day-to- day was going to be like, and it’s so different because I didn’t romanticise any element of it. But I think, as Americans especially, what you do know about the royals is what you read in fairytales, and you think is what you know about the royals. It’s easy to have an image that is so far from reality, and that’s what was so tricky over those past few years, when the perception and the reality are two different things and you’re being judged on the perception but you’re living the reality of it. There’s a complete misalignment and there’s no way to explain that to people.

Oprah: With every family things get serious when you’re brought in to meet the grandmother or the mother. The grandmother is the matriarch and, in your situation it’s the Queen.

24 Oprah promised the Sussexes had no prior knowledge of what they would be asked Credit: ITV

Meghan: She was one of the first people I met. The real Queen.

Oprah: What was that like? Were you worried about making the right impression?

Meghan: There wasn’t a huge formality the first time I met Her Majesty The Queen. We were going for lunch at Royal Lodge, which is where some other members of the family live, specifically Andrew and Fergie, and Eugenie and Beatrice would spend a lot of time there. Eugenie and I had known each other before I knew Harry, so that was comfortable and it turned out the Queen was finishing a church service in Windsor and so she was going to be at the house. Harry and I were in the car and he says, ‘OK, well my grandmother is there, you’re going to meet her’. (I said) ‘OK, great’. I loved my grandmother, I used to take care of my grandmother. (He said) ‘Do you know how to curtsey?’ ‘What?’ ‘Do you know how to curtsey?’ I thought genuinely that’s what happens outside, that was part of the fanfare. I didn’t think that’s what happens inside. I go, ‘But it’s your grandmother’. He goes, ‘It’s the Queen!’

Oprah: Wow!

Meghan: And that was really the first moment the penny dropped?

Oprah: Did you Google how to curtsey?

Meghan: No, we were in the car. Deeply, to show respect, I learned it very quickly right in front of the house. We practised and walked in.

Oprah: Harry practised?

Meghan: Yeah, and Fergie ran out and said, ‘Are you ready? Do you know how to curtsey? Oh, my goodness, you guys’. I practised very quickly and went in, and apparently I did a very deep curtsey, and we just sat there and we chatted and it was lovely and easy and I think, thank God, I hadn’t known a lot about the family. Thank God, I hadn’t researched. I would have been so in my head about all of it.

Oprah: (What) you’re sharing with us is that you were no more nervous as a regular person who goes to meet somebody’s grandmother.

Meghan: I had confused the idea. I grew up in LA, you see celebrities all the time. This is not the same but it’s very easy, especially as an American, to go, ‘These are famous people’. This is a completely different ball game.

(Cut to them and Oprah at their house)

Oprah: What are you feeling here (their home)? What’s the word?

Meghan: Peace.

Oprah: Peace?

Meghan: Yeah.

(Oprah narrates) The day after our interview, I stopped over to Harry and Meghan’s new home.

Meghan: Hi, Guy (dog).

Oprah: Hi, Guy.

Meghan: Yeah, Guy’s been — Guy’s been through everything with me.

Oprah: Yeah, from the beginning, from the very first date, yeah?

Meghan: If Guy, I mean, I had him in Canada. I got him from a kill shelter in Kentucky.

Oprah: Yeah?

(In Harry and Meghan’s hen coop)

Meghan: Hi, girls!

(Oprah narrates) We put on wellies to feed the hens Meghan and Harry recently rescued from a factory farm. ‘I love your little designer house here. Archie’s chick inn. Oh, how cute is that.’

Harry: She’s always wanted chickens.

Meghan: Well, you know, I just love rescuing.

Oprah: So, this is a part of your new life? What are you most excited about?

Meghan: Whoop! You’re OK . . .

Oprah: What are you most excited about in the new life? What are you most excited about? Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.

Meghan: I think just being able to live authentically.

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: Right? Like this kind of stuff. It’s so, it’s so basic, but it’s really fulfilling. Just getting back down to basics. I was thinking about it — even at our wedding, you know, three days before our wedding, we got married . . .

Oprah: Ah!

Meghan: No one knows that. But we called the Archbishop, and we just said, ‘Look, this thing, this spectacle is for the world, but we want our union between us’. So, like, the vows that we have framed in our room are just the two of us in our backyard with the Archbishop of Canterbury, and that was the piece that . . .

Harry: Just the three of us.

Oprah: Really?

Harry: Just the three of us.

Meghan: Just the three of us.

(Back to Oprah)

Oprah: You know, the wedding was the most perfect picture, you know, anybody’s ever seen. But through that picture that we were all seeing, behind the scenes, obviously, there was a lot of drama going on. And soon after your marriage, the tabloids started offering stories that painted a not-so-flattering picture of you in your new world. There were rumours about you being ‘Hurricane Meghan’.

Meghan: I hadn’t heard that.

24 She said she didn't research the Royal Family before she married Harry Credit: AFP and licensors

Oprah: OK.

Oprah: So, there were rumours about you being Hurricane Meghan, for the departure of several high-profile palace staff members. And there was also a story — did you hear this one? — about you making Kate Middleton cry?

Meghan: This I heard about.

Oprah: You heard about that. OK.

Meghan: This was . . . that was . . . that was a turning point.

Oprah: That was a turning point?

Meghan: Yeah.

Kate made me cry days before wedding, but I got blamed... that was hard.

(Oprah narrates) Six months after Harry and Meghan’s wedding, headlines began to swirl about a rift between Meghan and her sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton. It was reported that Meghan had left Kate “in tears” over the bride-to-be’s “strict demands” over flower-girl dresses.

Meghan: The narrative with Kate — which didn’t happen — was really, really difficult and something that . . . I think that’s when everything changed, really.

Oprah: You say the narrative with Kate, it didn’t happen. So, specifically, did you make Kate cry?

Meghan: No.

Oprah: So, where did that come from?

Meghan: (Sighs)

Oprah: Was there a situation where she might have cried? Or she could have cried?

Meghan: No, no. The reverse happened. And I don’t say that to be disparaging to anyone, because it was a really hard week of the wedding. And she was upset about something, but she owned it, and she apologised. And she brought me flowers and a note, apologising. And she did what I would do if I knew that I hurt someone, right, to just take accountability for it. What was shocking was . . . what was that, six, seven months after our wedding?

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: That the reverse of that would be out in the world.

Oprah: The story came out six, seven months after it actually happened?

Meghan: Yeah.

Oprah: So, when you say . . .

Meghan: I would have never wanted that to come out about her ever, even though it had happened. I protected that from ever being out in the world.

Oprah: So, when you say the reverse happened, explain to us what you mean by that.

Meghan: A few days before the wedding, she was upset about something pertaining — yes, the issue was correct — about flower-girl dresses, and it made me cry, and it really hurt my feelings. And I thought, in the context of everything else that was going on in those days leading to the wedding, that it didn’t make sense to not be just doing whatever everyone else was doing, which was trying to be supportive, knowing what was going on with my dad and whatnot.

Oprah: This was a really big story at the time, that you made Kate cry. Now you’re saying you didn’t make Kate cry, Kate made you cry. So, we all want to know, what would make you cry? What . . . what were you going through? You were going through all of the anxiety that brides go through putting their wedding together and going through all of the issues with your father: Was he coming? Was he not coming?

Meghan: Mmm.

Oprah: And there was a confrontation over the . . . the dresses?

Meghan: It wasn’t a confrontation, and I actually don’t think it’s fair to her to get into the details of that, because she apologised.

Oprah: OK.

Meghan: And I’ve forgiven her.

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: What was hard to get over was being blamed for something that not only I didn’t do but that happened to me. And the people who were part of our wedding going to our comms team and saying, ‘I know this didn’t happen.’ I don’t have to tell them what actually happened.

Oprah: OK.

Meghan: But I can at least go on the record and say she didn’t make her cry. And they were all told the same . . .

Oprah: So, all the time the stories were out that you had made Kate cry . . . you knew all along, and people around you knew that that wasn’t true?

Meghan: Everyone in the institution knew it wasn’t true.

Oprah: So, why didn’t somebody just say that?

Meghan: That’s a good question.

Oprah: Hmm.

Meghan: I’m not sharing that piece about Kate in any way to be disparaging to her. I think it’s really important for people to understand the truth.

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: But also I think, a lot of it, that was fed into by the media. And I would hope that she would have wanted that corrected, and maybe in the same way that the Palace wouldn’t let anybody else.

Oprah: Yeah.

Meghan: Negate it, they wouldn’t let her, because she’s a good person. And I think so much of what I have seen play out is this idea of polarity, where if you love me, you don’t have to hate her. And if you love her, you don’t need to hate me.

Oprah: Mm-hmm. You know, there were several stories that compared headlines written about you to those written about Kate.

24 Meghan said the Queen was one of the first people she met Credit: Getty

Meghan: Mmm.

Oprah: Since you don’t read things, let me tell you what was said.

Meghan: OK.

Oprah: There were stories where Kate was being praised for holding her baby bump.

Meghan: Oh, gosh, have I done it since we’ve been sitting down?

Oprah: Yes, you’ve been doing it the whole time.

Meghan: Probably. OK.

Oprah: Kate was praised for cradling her baby bump, and the headline about you doing the same thing said, ‘Meghan can’t keep hands off her baby bump for pride or vanity’.

Meghan: What does it have to do with pride or vanity?

Oprah: Well, I’m just — I’m just telling you about the stories, OK?

Meghan: OK, I hear you.

Oprah: Then there was a whole online piece about this: ‘Kate eating avocados to help with morning sickness’.

Meghan: (Laughs) I heard — OK, I heard about the avocado one.

Oprah: But you were eating avocados . . .

Meghan: And fuelling murder, apparently.

Oprah: Wolfing down a fruit linked to water shortages, illegal deforestation and environmental devastation. There was, seems . . . there seems to be . . . there was a . . .

Meghan: That’s a really loaded piece of toast. (Laughter) I mean . . . you have to laugh at a certain point, because it’s just ridiculous.

Oprah: That’s good: ‘That’s a loaded piece of toast.’ It’s about deforestation and . . .

Meghan: Oh, man!

Oprah: Oh, wow! So, do you think there was a standard for Kate in general and a separate one for you? And if so, why?

Meghan: I don’t know why. I can see now what layers were at play.

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: And, again, they really seemed to want a narrative of a hero and a villain.

Oprah: Yeah. You came in as the first mixed-race person to marry into the family, and did that concern you in being able to fit in?

Meghan: Mmm.

Oprah: And did that concern you in being able to fit in? Did you think about that at all?

Meghan: I thought about it because they made me think about it.

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: Right? But at the same time now, upon reflection, thank God all of those things were true. Thank God I had that life experience. Thank god I had known the value of working. My first job was when I was 13, at a frozen yoghurt shop called Humphrey Yogart.

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

24 Meghan revealed Kate Middleton made her cry days before her wedding Credit: AP:Associated Press

Meghan: I’ve always worked. I’ve always valued independence. I’ve always been outspoken, especially about women’s rights. I mean, that’s the sad irony of the last four years . . . is I’ve advocated for so long for women to use their voice, and then I was silent.

Oprah: Were you silent? Or were you silenced?

Meghan: The latter.

Oprah: So, how does that work? Were you told by the comms people, or the, I don’t know, the institution? Were you told to keep silent? How were you told to handle tabloids or gossip? Were you . . . were you told to say nothing?

Meghan: Everyone from . . . everyone in my world was given very clear directive, from the moment the world knew Harry and I were dating, to always say, ‘No comment’. That’s my friends, my mom and dad.

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: And we did.

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: I did anything they told me to do — of course I did, because it was also through the lens of, ‘And we’ll protect you’. So, even as things started to roll out in the media that I didn’t see — but my friends would call me and say, ‘Meg, this is really bad’ — because I didn’t see it, I’d go, ‘Don’t worry. I’m being protected’.

Oprah: Mmm.

Meghan: I believed that. And I think that was . . . that was really hard to reconcile because it was only . . . it was only once we were married and everything started to really worsen that I came to under-stand that not only was I not being protected, but they were willing to lie to protect other members of the family but they weren’t willing to tell the truth to protect me and my husband.

Oprah: So, are you saying you did not feel supported by the powers that be, be that The Firm, the monar-chy, all of them?

Meghan: It’s hard for people to distinguish the two because there’s . . . it’s a family business, right?

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: So, there’s the family, and then there’s the people that are running the institution. Those are two separate things. And it’s important to be able to compartmentalise that, because the Queen, for example, has always been wonderful to me. I mean, we had one of our first joint engagements together. She asked me to join her, and I . . .

Oprah: Was this on the train?

Meghan: Yeah, on the train.

Oprah: Yeah.

Meghan: We had breakfast together that morning, and she’d given me a beautiful gift, and I just really loved being in her company. And I remember we were in the car . . .

Oprah: Can you share what the gift was? Or . . .

Meghan: Yes. She gave me beautiful pearl earrings and a matching necklace. And we were in the car going between engagements, and she has a blanket that sits across her knees for warmth. And it was chilly, and she was like, ‘Meghan, come on’ and put it over my knees as well.

Oprah: Oh, nice.

Meghan: Right. Just moments of . . . and it made me think of my grand-mother, where she’s always been warm and inviting and . . . and really welcoming.

Oprah: So, OK, so she made you feel welcomed?

Meghan: Yes.

Oprah: Did you feel welcomed by everyone? It seemed like you and Kate . . . at the Wimbledon game where you were going to watch a friend play tennis . . .

Meghan: (Laughs)

Oprah: Was it what it looked like? You are two sisters-in-law out there in the world, getting to know each other. Was she helping you, embracing you into the family, helping you adjust?

Meghan: I think everyone welcomed me.

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: And, yeah, when you say, ‘Was it what it looked like?’, my under-standing and my experience of the past four years is it’s nothing like what it looks like. It’s nothing like what it looks like. And I . . . and I remember so often people within The Firm would say, ‘Well, you can’t do this because it’ll look like that. You can’t’. So, even, ‘Can I go and have lunch with my friends?’ ‘No, no, no, you’re oversaturated, you’re every-where, it would be best for you to not go out to lunch with your friends’. I go, ‘Well, I haven’t . . . I haven’t left the house in months’.

I mean, there was a day that one of the members of the family, she came over, and she said, ‘Why don’t you just lay low for a little while, because you are everywhere right now’. And I said, ‘I’ve left the house twice in four months. I’m everywhere, but I am nowhere’. And from that standpoint, I continued to say to people, ‘I know there’s an obsession with how things look, but has anyone talked about how it feels? Because right now, I could not feel lonelier’.

Oprah: Hmm. You were feeling lonely, even though your prince . . . you’re in love, you’re with him.

Meghan: I’m not lonely . . . I wasn’t lonely with him.

Oprah: Yeah.

Meghan: There were moments that he had to work or he had to go away, there’s moments in the middle of the night. And so, there was very little that I was allowed to do.

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: And so, yeah, of course that breeds loneliness when you’ve come from such a full life or when you’ve come from freedom. I think the easiest way that now people can understand it is what we’ve all gone through in lockdown.

Oprah: Yeah, well, everybody can certainly relate now.

(Cuts to footage of interview with ITV’s Tom Bradby in South Africa in October, 2019)

Meghan: . . . asked if I’m OK, but it’s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.

Bradby: And the answer is, would it be fair to say, ‘Not really OK’, as in it’s really been a struggle?

Meghan: Yes.

(Back to Oprah)

Oprah: Well, I would have to say, in South Africa, when the reporter stopped and asked, ‘Are you OK . . ?’

Meghan: Mmm.

Oprah: And, whooo, we all felt that. Why did that question strike such a nerve? What was going on with you, internally at that time?

Meghan: That was the last day of the tour. You know, those tours are . . . I’m sure they have beautiful pictures and it looks vibrant, and all of that is true. It’s also really exhausting. So, I was fried, and I think it just hit me so hard because we were making it look like every-thing was fine. I can understand why people were really surprised to see that there was pain there.

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: Because we were doing our job. Our job was to be on and to smile. And so, when he asked me that, I guess I had felt that it had never occurred to anyone that I, that I wasn’t OK, and that I had really been suffering. And I had known for a long time and had been asking the institution for help for quite a long time.

Oprah: Help for what?

Meghan: After we had gotten back from our Australia tour — which was about a year before that — and we talked about when things really started to turn, when I knew we weren’t being protected. And it was during that part of my pregnancy, especially, that I started to understand what our continued reality was going to look like.

Oprah: What kind of protection did you want that you feel you didn’t receive?

Meghan: I mean, they would go on the record and negate the most ridiculous story for anyone, right? I’m talking about things that are super-artificial and inconsequential. But the narrative about, you know, making Kate cry, I think was the beginning of a real character assassination. And they knew it wasn’t true. And I thought, well, if they’re not going to kill things like that, then what are we going to do?

It had never occurred to anyone that I wasn’t OK...I was really suffering, and asked for help.

Meghan: Separate from that, and what was happening behind closed doors was, you know, we knew I was pregnant. We now know it’s Archie, and it was a boy. We didn’t know any of that at the time. We can just talk about it as Archie now. And that was when they were saying they didn’t want him to be a prince or a princess — not knowing what the gender would be, which would be different from protocol — and that he wasn’t going to receive security.

Oprah: What?

Meghan: It was really hard.

Oprah: What do you mean?

Meghan: He wasn’t going to receive security. This went on for the last few months of our pregnancy, where I’m going, ‘Hold on a second’.

Oprah: That your son — and Harry, Prince Harry’s son was not going to receive security?

Meghan: That’s right, I know.

Oprah: How . . . but how does that work?

Meghan: How does that work? It’s like, ‘No, no, no. Look, because if he’s not going to be a prince, it’s like, OK, well, he needs to be safe, so we’re not saying don’t make him a prince or a princess — whatever it’s going to be . . .

‘But if you’re saying the title is what’s going to affect their protec-tion, we haven’t created this monster machine around us in terms of clickbait and tabloid fodder. You’ve allowed that to happen, which means our son needs to be safe’.

Oprah: So, how do they explain to you that your son, the grandson, the great-grandson of the Queen . . .

Meghan: Mm-hmm.

24 Meg shocked the world when she admitted she was struggling in an interview with ITV's Tom Bradby Credit: ITV

Oprah: . . . is not going to have . . . he wasn’t going to be a prince? How did they tell you that? And what reasons did they give? And then say, ‘And so, therefore, you’re not . . . you don’t need protection’.

Meghan: There’s no explanation.

Oprah: Hmm.

Meghan: There’s no version. I mean, that’s the other piece of that . . .

Oprah: Who tells you that?

Meghan: I heard a lot of it through Harry and then other parts of it through conversations with . . .

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: . . . family members. And it was a decision that they felt was appropriate. And I thought, well . . .

Oprah: Was the title . . . was him being called a prince, Archie being called a prince, was that important to you?

Meghan: If it meant he was going to be safe, then, of course. All the grandeur surrounding this stuff is an attachment that I don’t personally have, right? I’ve been a waitress, an actress, a princess, a duchess. I’ve always just still been Meghan, right? So, for me, I’m clear on who I am, independent of all that stuff. And the most important title I will ever have is Mom. I know that.

Meghan: But the idea of our son not being safe, and also the idea of the first member of colour in this family not being titled in the same way that other grandchildren would be . . . You know, the other piece of that conversation is, there’s a convention — I forget if it was George V or George VI convention — that when you’re the grandchild of the monarch, so when Harry’s dad becomes king, automatically Archie and our next baby would become prince or princess, or whatever they were going to be.

Oprah: So, for you, it’s about protection and safety, not so much as what the . . . what the title means to the world.

Meghan: That’s a huge piece of it, but, I mean, but . . .

Oprah: . . . and that having the title gives you the safety and protection?

Meghan: Yeah, but also it’s not their right to take it away.

Oprah: Yeah.

Meghan: Right? And so, I think even with that convention I’m talking about, while I was pregnant, they said they want to change the convention for Archie.

Oprah: Mmm.

Meghan: Well, why?

Oprah: Did you get an answer?

Meghan: No.

Oprah: You still don’t have an answer?

Meghan: No.

Oprah: You know, we had heard — the world, those of us out here reading the things or hearing the things — that it was you and Harry who didn’t want Archie to have a prince title. So, you’re telling me that is not true?

Meghan: No, and it’s not our decision to make, right?

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: . . . even though I have a lot of clarity on what comes with the titles, good and bad — and from my experience, a lot of pain.

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: I, again, wouldn’t wish pain on my child, but that is their birthright to then make a choice about.

Oprah: OK, so it feels to me like things started to change when you and Harry decided that you were not going to take the picture that had been a part of the tradition for years and . . .

Meghan: We weren’t asked to take a picture. That’s also part of the spin, that was really damaging. I thought, ‘Can you just tell them the truth? Can you say to the world you’re not giving him a title, and we want to keep him safe, and that if he’s not a prince, then it’s not part of the tradition? Just tell people, and then they’ll understand?’

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: But they wouldn’t do that.

Oprah: But you were . . . you both, obviously, were aware that ha­d been a part of the tradition? And there was a . . . was there a specific reason why you didn’t want to be a part of that tradition? I think many people interpreted that as you were both saying, ‘We’re going to do things our way. We’re going to do things a different way’.

Meghan: That’s not it at all. I mean, I think what was really hard . . . so, picture, now that you know what was going on behind the scenes, right? There was a lot of fear surrounding it. I was very scared of having to offer up our baby, knowing that they weren’t going to be kept safe.

Oprah: You certainly must have had some conversations with Harry about it and have your own suspicions as to why they didn’t want to make Archie a prince. What are . . . what are those thoughts? Why do you think that is? Do you think it’s because of his race?

Meghan: (Sighs)

Oprah: And I know that’s a loaded question, but . . .

Meghan: But I can give you an honest answer. In those months when I was pregnant, all around this same time . . . so we have in tandem the conversation of ‘He won’t be given security, he’s not going to be given a title’ and also concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he’s born.

Oprah: What?

Meghan: And . . .

Oprah: Who . . . who is having that conversation with you? What?

Meghan: So . . .

Oprah: There is a conversation . . . hold on. Hold up. Hold up. Stop right now.

Meghan: There were . . . there were several conversations about it.

Oprah: There’s a conversation with you . . ?

Meghan: With Harry.

Oprah: About how dark your baby is going to be?

Meghan: Potentially, and what that would mean or look like.

Oprah: Whoo. And you’re not going to tell me who had the conversation?

Meghan: I think that would be very damaging to them.

Oprah: OK. So, how . . . how does one have that meeting?

There were conversations ...about no security, no title... and how dark his skin might be when he’s born.

Meghan: That was relayed to me from Harry. Those were conversations that family had with him. And I think . . .

Oprah: Whoa.

Meghan: It was really hard to be able to see those as compartmentalised conversations.

Oprah: Because they were concerned that if he were too brown, that that would be a problem? Are you saying that?

Meghan: I wasn’t able to follow up with why, but that — if that’s the assumption you’re making, I think that feels like a pretty safe one, which was really hard to understand, right? Especially when — look, I — the Commonwealth is a huge part of the monarchy, and I lived in Canada, which is a Commonwealth country, for seven years. But it wasn’t until Harry and I were together that we started to travel through the Commonwealth, I would say 60 per cent, 70 per cent of which is people of colour, right?

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: And growing up as a woman of colour, as a little girl of colour, I know how important representation is. I know how you want to see someone who looks like you in certain positions.

Oprah: Obviously.

Meghan: Even Archie. Like, we read these books, and now he’s been — there’s one line in one that goes, ‘If you can see it, you can be it’. And he goes, ‘You can be it!’ And I think about that so often, especially in the context of these young girls, but even grown women and men who, when I would meet them in our time in the Commonwealth, how much it meant to them to be able to see someone who looks like them . . .

24 Meghan and Harry, who introduced Archie in May 2019, said there were concerns about how dark their baby's skin would be Credit: AFP

Oprah: Mmm.

Meghan: . . . in this position. And I could never understand how it wouldn’t be seen as an added benefit . . .

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: . . . and a reflection of the world today. At all times, but especially right now, to go — ‘how inclusive is that, that you can see someone who looks like you in this family, much less one who’s born into it?’

(Oprah narrates) When Meghan joined the Royal Family in 2018, she became the target of unrelenting, pervasive attacks. Racist abuse online aimed at Meghan Markle. There were undeniable racist overtones. This stands apart from the kind of coverage we’ve seen of any other royal.

There was constant criticism, blatant sexist and racist remarks by British tabloids and internet trolls. We have seen the racism towards her play out in real time. Referring to her as ‘straight outta Compton’. The daily onslaught of vitriol and condemnation from the UK Press became overwhelming and, in Meghan’s words, ‘almost unsurvivable’. (Back to Oprah)

Oprah: You’d said in a podcast that it became ‘almost unsurvivable’, and that struck me, because it sounds like you were in some kind of mental trouble. What was actually going on? ‘Almost unsurvivable’ sounds like there was a breaking point.

Meghan: Yeah, there was. I just didn’t see a solution. I would sit up at night, and I was just, like, I don’t understand how all of this is being churned out. And, again, I wasn’t seeing it, but it’s almost worse when you feel it through the expression of my mom or my friends, or them calling me crying, just, like, ‘Meg, they’re not protecting you’. And I realised that it was all happening just because I was breathing.

Oprah: Mmm.

Meghan: And, look, I was really ashamed to say it at the time and ashamed to have to admit it to Harry, especially, because I know how much loss he’s suffered. But I knew that if I didn’t say it, that I would do it. And I . . . I just didn’t . . . I just didn’t want to be alive any more. And that was a very clear and real and frightening constant thought. And I remember — I remember how he just cradled me. And I was — I went to the institution, and I said that I needed to go somewhere to get help. I said that, ‘I’ve never felt this way before, and I need to go somewhere’. And I was told that I couldn’t, that it wouldn’t be good for the institution. And I called . . .

Oprah: So the institution is never a person. Or is it a series of people?

Meghan: No, it’s a person.

Oprah: It’s a person.

Meghan: It’s several people. But I went to one of the most senior people just to . . . to get help. And that — you know, I share this, because there’s so many people who are afraid to voice that they need help. And I know, personally, how hard it is to not just voice it, but when you voice it, to be told no.

Oprah: Whoo.

Meghan: And so, I went to human resources, and I said, ‘I just really — I need help’. Because in my old job, there was a union, and they would protect me. And I remember this conversation like it was yesterday, because they said, ‘My heart goes out to you, because I see how bad it is, but there’s nothing we can do to protect you because you’re not a paid employee of the institution’.

Oprah: Mmm.

24 They refused to name who had 'those conversations' Credit: PA:Press Association/PA Images

Meghan: This wasn’t a choice. This was emails and begging for help, saying very specifically, ‘I am concerned for my mental welfare’. And people going, ‘Oh, yes, yes, it’s disproportionately terrible what we see out there to anyone else’. But nothing was ever done, so we had to find a solution.

Oprah: Wow! ‘I don’t want to be alive any more,’ that’s . . .

Meghan: I thought it would have solved everything for everyone, right?

Oprah: So, were you thinking of harming yourself? Were you having suicidal thoughts?

Meghan: Yes. This was very, very clear.

Oprah: Wow.

Meghan: Very clear and very scary. And, you know, I didn’t know who to even turn to in that. And one of the people that I reached out to, who’s continued to be a friend and confidant, was one of my husband’s mom’s best friends, one of Diana’s best friends. Because it’s, like, who else could understand what’s . . .what it’s actually like on the inside?

Oprah: Did you ever think about going to a hospital? Or is that possible, that you can check yourself in some place?

Meghan: No, that’s what I was asking to do.

Oprah: Yeah.

Meghan: You can’t just do that. I couldn’t, you know, call an Uber to the palace.

Oprah: Yeah.

Meghan: You couldn’t just go. You couldn’t. I mean, you have to understand, as well, when I joined that family, that was the last time, until we came here, that I saw my passport, my driver’s licence, my keys. All that gets turned over. I didn’t see any of that any more.

Oprah: Well, the way you’re describing this, it . . . it’s like you were trapped and couldn’t get help, even though you’re on the verge of suicide. That’s what you are describing. That’s what I’m hearing.

Meghan: Yes.

Oprah: And that would be an accurate interpretation, yes?

Meghan: That’s the truth.

Oprah: That’s the truth.

Meghan: You know, and if you think about . . . it was one of the things that . . . it stills haunts me is this photograph that someone had sent me. We had to go to an official event. We had to go to this event at the Royal Albert Hall, and a friend said, ‘I know you don’t look at pictures, but, oh, my God, you guys look so great . . .’

Oprah: Yeah.

Meghan: . . . and sent it to me. And I zoomed in, and what I saw was the truth of what that moment was, because right before we had to leave for that, I had just had that conversation with Harry that morning, and it was the next day that I talked to the institution.

Oprah: You had the conversation ‘I don’t want to be alive any more’?

Meghan: Yeah.

Oprah: Whoo.

Meghan: No, and it was . . . it wasn’t even, ‘I don’t want to’.

Oprah: And then, you . . ?

Meghan: It was like, ‘These are the thoughts that I’m having in the middle of the night that are very clear . . .’

Oprah: Yes, clarification.

Meghan: ‘. . . and I’m scared, because this is very real. This isn’t some abstract idea. This is methodical, and this is not who I am’. But we had to go to this event, and I remember him saying, ‘I don’t think you can go’. And I said, ‘I can’t be left alone’.

Oprah: Because you were afraid of what you might do to yourself?

Meghan: And we went, and that . . .

Oprah: I’m so sorry to hear that.

Meghan: . . . and that picture, if you zoom in, what I see is how tightly his knuckles are gripped around mine. You can see the whites of our knuckles, because we are smiling and doing our job, but we’re both just trying to hold on. And every time that those lights went down in that Royal Box, I was just weeping, and he was gripping my hand.

24 Pregnant Meghan was pictured at the Albert Hall in 2019 on the day she said she felt like taking her life Credit: PA:Press Association

Oprah: Wow.

Meghan: And then, it was, ‘OK, intermission’s coming, the lights are about to come on, everyone’s looking at us again’, and you have to just be on again.

Oprah: Yeah.

Meghan: And that’s, I think, so important for people to remember is you have no idea what’s going on for someone behind closed doors. You have no idea. Even the people that smile the biggest smiles and shine the brightest lights, it seems, to have compassion for what’s actually potentially going on.

Oprah: I know. The public is looking at you. And to think that you, earlier in the day, had said to Harry that you didn’t want to be alive any more.

Meghan: Yeah. And just hours before, just sitting on the . . . the steps in our cottage . . .

Oprah: Mmm.

Meghan: . . . just sitting there and then going, ‘ok, well, go upstairs and put your make-up bag in your sink and try to pull yourself together’.

Oprah: Nobody should have to go through that.

Meghan: And, you know, Harry and I are working on this mental health series for Apple, and we — yes, so — we, we, we hear a lot of these stories. Nobody should have to go through that. It takes so much courage to admit that you need help.

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: It takes so much courage to voice that. And as I said, I was ashamed. I’m supposed to be stronger than that.

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: I don’t want to put more on my husband’s shoulders. He’s carrying the weight of the world. I don’t want to bring that to him. I bring solutions. To admit that you need help, to admit how dark of a place you’re in.

Oprah: You’ve said some pretty shocking things here, revealing . . .

Meghan: I wasn’t planning to say anything shocking.

Oprah: OK.

Meghan: I’m just telling you what’s happened.

Oprah: OK.

Meghan: I’m sorry if it’s shocked you! It’s been a lot.

Oprah: I’m a little shocked.

Meghan: It’s been a lot.

Oprah: How do you feel about the palace hearing you speak your truth today? Are you afraid of a backlash or their reaction?

Meghan: I mean, I think I’m not going to live my life in fear. You know, I think so much of it is said with an understanding of just truth.

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: But I think, to answer your question, I don’t know how they could expect that after all of this time, we would still just be silent if there is an active role that The Firm is playing in perpetuating falsehoods about us.

Oprah: Mmm.

Meghan: That at a certain point, you’re going to go, ‘But, you guys, someone just tell the truth’. And if that comes with risk of losing things, I mean, I’ve lost . . . there’s a lot that’s been lost already.

Oprah: Mmm.

24 Now she is expecting her second child and says she knows life is worth living

Meghan: And I grieve a lot. I mean, I’ve lost my father. I lost a baby. I nearly lost my name. I mean, there’s the loss of identity. But I’m still standing, and my hope for people in the takeaway from this is to know that there’s another side.

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: To know that life is worth living.

Oprah: OK. I’m so glad you see that now. We are going to take a break, y’all, and Harry’s going to join us.

Meghan: (Laughter)

(Ads and back to Oprah)

Oprah: So, hi.

Harry: Hello.

Oprah: Thanks for joining us.

Harry: Thanks for having me.

Oprah: You’ve been watching on the side, yeah?

Harry: Some of it.

Oprah: Yes. I want to say, first of all, let’s say congratulations . . .

Harry: Thank you.

Oprah: . . . for the new addition to your family. Meghan said she wanted to wait until you were here to tell us, is it a boy or is it a girl?

Meghan: You can tell her.

Harry: No, go for it.

Meghan: No, no.

Harry: It’s a girl.

Oprah: (Squeals)

Meghan: It’s a girl.

Harry: Yes!

Oprah: You’re going to have a daughter. Wow.

Meghan: It’s a girl.

Oprah: When you realised that and saw it on the ultrasound, what . . . what . . . what was your first thought?

Harry: Amazing. Just grateful, like any — to have any child, any one or any two would have been amazing. But to have a boy and then a girl, you know, what more can you ask for? But now, you know, now we — we’ve got our family. We’ve got, you know, the four of us and our two dogs, and it’s great.

Oprah: Done. Done? Two is it?

Harry: Done.

Meghan: Two is it.

Oprah: Two is it.

Meghan: Two is it.

Oprah: And when’s the baby due?

Meghan: In summertime.

Oprah: This summertime?

Meghan: Yeah.

Oprah: So, you all have been living in sunny California now for . . .

Meghan: Since March.

Oprah: Since March, OK.

(Oprah narrates) In late 2019, Prince Harry and Meghan left the UK And moved to Canada. The couple says they chose Canada, a commonwealth of Britain, with the intention of continuing to serve the Queen. After their move, Harry and Meghan say security normally provided by the Royal Family was cut off. By March 2020, just days before the Covid lockdown began, Meghan, Harry and Archie relocated to Los Angeles, where media mogul Tyler Perry offered them his home as a temporary refuge. He also provided security.

Three months later they bought their own home and settled in the Santa Barbara area. Last spring, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex created their own foundation and media content company called Archewell.

24 In late 2019 Harry and Meghan left the UK and moved to Canada Credit: BackGrid

Oprah: And so you stayed at Tyler Perry’s house for several months.

Harry: Three months, I believe.

Meghan: Yeah, because we didn’t have a plan. We needed . . . we needed a house and he offered security as well, so it gave us breathing room to try to figure out what we are going to do.

Harry: The biggest concern was that while we were in Canada, in someone else’s house, I then got told at short notice security was going to be removed. By this point, courtesy of the Daily Mail, the world knew exact . . . our exact location. So suddenly it dawned on me, ‘Hang on a second. The borders could be closed. We’re going to have our security removed. Who knows how long lockdown’s going to be? The world knows where we are. It’s not safe. It’s not secure’.

Meghan: Well, and also . . .

Harry: We probably need to get out of here.

Oprah: So, what security did you have at the time that was going to be removed?

Harry: We had our UK security.

Oprah: So you got word from overseas?

Harry: Yeah.

Oprah: That ‘we’re taking away your security’. Why were they doing that?

Harry: Their justification is a change in status, of which I pushed back and said, ‘Well, is there a change of threat or risk?’ And after many weeks of waiting, eventually I got the confirmation that no, the risk and threat hasn’t changed but due to our change of status, (by) which we would no longer be official working members of the Royal Family, they’re obviously . . . what we proposed was sort of part-time, or at least as much as we could do without being fully consumed because of, I think, what most of you guys have covered already.

Meghan: We actually didn’t talk about that. It’s been so spun in the wrong direction, as though we quit, we walked away, we . . . all the conversations of the two years before we finally announced it.

(Oprah narrates) In January 2020, Prince Harry and Meghan announced they would step back as senior members of the Royal Family. The swiftness with which they’ve taken this decision, only 18 months after they got married, has taken everyone by surprise, from the Queen all the way down.

The bombshell news sparked a worldwide media frenzy dubbed ‘Megxit’ by the British Press. Many reporters and viral posts blamed Meghan for the decision. In an official statement, Queen Elizabeth said: ‘Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family.’ (Back to Oprah)

Oprah: OK, let me ask the question.

Meghan: Yeah?

Oprah: So, over a year ago, you shocked the world. You announced you were stepping back as senior members of the Royal Family. And then the media reported that you had ‘blindsided’ the Queen, your grandmother. So here’s a time to set the record straight. What was the tipping point that made you decide you had to leave?

Harry: Yeah, it was desperate. I went to all the places which I thought I should go to, to ask for help. We both did.

Meghan: Mm-hmm.

Harry: Separately and together.

Oprah: So you left because you were asking for help and couldn’t get it?

Harry: Yeah, basically. But we never left.

Meghan: We never left the family and we only wanted to have the same type of role that exists, right? There’s senior members of the family and then there are non-senior members. And we said, specifically, ‘We’re stepping back from senior roles to be just like several . . .’ I mean, I can think of so many right now who are all . . . they’re royal highnesses, prince or princess, duke or duchess . . . who earn a living, live on palace grounds, can support the Queen if and when called upon. So we weren’t reinventing the wheel here. We were saying, ‘OK, if this isn’t working for everyone, we’re in a lot of pain, you can’t provide us with the help we need, we can just take a step back. We can do it in a Commonwealth country’. We suggested New Zealand, South Africa . . .

Harry: Take a breath.

Meghan: Canada.

Oprah: Yeah. And you wanted to take a breath from what specifically? Let’s be clear.

24 By March 2020, just days before lockdown, the family had relocated to LA Credit: The Mega Agency

Harry: From this . . . this constant barrage. My biggest concern was history repeating itself and I’ve said that before on numerous occasions, very publicly. And what I was seeing was history repeating itself. But more, perhaps. Or definitely far more dangerous because then you add race in and you add social media in. And when I’m talking about history repeating itself, I’m talking about my . . . my mother.

Harry: When you can see something happening in the same kind of way, anybody would ask for help, ask the system of which you are a part of — especially when you know there’s a relationship there — that they could help and share some truth or call . . . call the dogs off, whatever you want to call it. So to receive no help at all and to be told continuously, ‘This is how it is. This is just how it is. We’ve all been through it’ . . . and I think the biggest turning point for me was the . . . and it didn’t take very long. It was actually right at the beginning . . . was, OK, this union . . . us, me, being . . . having a girlfriend was going to be a thing. Of course it was. But I . . . I never expected, or I never thought . . .

Oprah: Because she was mixed race?

Harry: No, just . . . just the two of us to start with. I hadn’t really thought about the mixed-race piece because I thought, well . . . well, firstly, you know, I’ve spent many years doing the work and doing my own learning. But my upbringing in the system, of which I was brought up in and what I’ve been exposed to, it wasn’t . . . I wasn’t aware of it to start with. But, my god, it doesn’t take very long to suddenly become aware of it.

Oprah: Yeah, because you said you really weren’t aware of unconscious bias and all that that represents . . .

Harry: No.

Oprah: Until you met Meghan.

Harry: Yeah. You know, as sad as it is to say, it takes living in her shoes — in this instance, for a day, or those first eight days — to see where it was going to go and how far they were going to take it.

Oprah: And get away with it?

Harry: And get away with it and be so blatant about it. That’s the bit that shocked me. This is . . . we’re talking about the UK Press here, right? And this . . . the UK is my home. That is . . . that is where I was brought up. So yes, I’ve got my own relationship that goes back a long way with the media. I asked for calm from the British tabloids — once as a boyfriend, once as a husband and once as a father.

Oprah: So when I ask the question, ‘Why did you leave?’ the simplest answer is . . ?

Harry: Lack of support and lack of understanding.

Oprah: So, I want clarity. Was the move about getting away from the UK Press? Because the Press, as you know, is everywhere. Or was the move because you weren’t getting enough support from The Firm?

Harry: It was both.

Oprah: Both.

Harry: Yeah.

Oprah: Did you blindside the Queen?

Harry: No. I’ve never blindsided my grandmother. I have too much respect for her.

Oprah: So where did that story come from?

Harry: I hazard a guess that it probably could have come from within the institution.

Oprah: Mmm.

Meghan: So, I remember when you talked to her several times about this over . . .

Harry: Two years.

Meghan: Two years. But even the night before, days before, with the statement coming out, I remember that conversation.

Oprah: So, how do you know she wasn’t blindsided? Because the way it was presented through the Press is that suddenly you made this announcement. She didn’t know it was coming.

24 Harry insisted the Queen wasn't blindsided by Megxit Credit: AFP or licensors

Harry: No, I . . . when we were in Canada, I had three conversations with my grandmother and two conversations with my father and — before he stopped taking my calls — and he said, ‘Can you put this all in writing what your plan is?’

Oprah: Your father asked you to put it in writing.

Prince Harry: Yeah. He asked me to put it in writing and I put all the specifics in there, even the fact that we were planning on putting the announcement out on January 7.

Oprah: So you just said that your dad stopped taking your calls. Why did he stop taking your calls?

Harry: Because I took matters in . . . by that point, I took matters into my own hands. It was like, ‘I need to do this for my family. This is not a surprise to anybody. It’s really sad that it’s gotten to this point but I’ve got to do something for my own mental health, my wife’s and for Archie’s as well’. Because I could see where this was headed.

Meghan: To have sat back and not said that for so long, it just feels really . . .

Oprah: To have been silenced all this time.

Meghan: Yeah.

Harry: Been three and a half, four years. Or longer, actually.

Meghan: We were saying . . . gosh, it must have been years ago we were sitting in Nottingham (Nottingham Cottage, where Harry lived as a bachelor and when first married) . . . I was sitting in Nottingham Cottage and The Little Mermaid came on. Now, who watches . . . who as an adult really watches The Little Mermaid? But it came on and I was like, ‘Well, I’m just here all the time, so I may as well watch this’. And I went, ‘Oh, my god! She falls in love with the prince and because of that, she has to lose her voice’.

Oprah: Mmm.

Meghan: But by the end, she gets her voice back.

Oprah: Gets her voice back.

Meghan: Yeah.

Oprah: And this is what happened here? You feel like you got your voice back?

Meghan: Yeah.

Oprah: So, you . . . you’re stepping back out of frustration and you just need to get out. And, you know, you heard Meghan share with us all . . .

Harry: Mm-hmm.

Oprah: The moment that she came to you, had the courage enough to say out loud . . .

Harry: Mm-hmm.

My father said: Can you put your plan in writing? Then he stopped taking my calls. I’d taken matters into my own hands.

Oprah: ‘I don’t want to live any more.’

Harry: Mm-hmm.

Oprah: And you didn’t know what to do?

Harry: I had no idea what to do. I wasn’t . . . I wasn’t prepared for that. I went . . . I went to a very dark place as well. But I . . . I wanted to be there for her and . . .

Meghan: Also, we didn’t leave right that minute, right?

Harry: I was terrified.

Meghan: We still . . . that’s almost a year after.

Oprah: So then did you tell other people in the family, ‘I have to get help for her. We need help for her’?

Harry: No. That’s just not a conversation that would be had.

Oprah: Why?

Harry: I guess I was ashamed of admitting it to them.

Oprah: Oh.

Harry: And I don’t know whether . . . I don’t know whether they’ve had the same . . . whether they’ve had the same feelings or thoughts. I have no idea. And it’s a very trapping environment that a lot of them are stuck in.

Oprah: You were ashamed of admitting that Meghan needed help?

Harry: Yeah.

Oprah: Mmm.

Harry: I didn’t have anyone to turn to.

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Harry: You know, we’ve got some very close friends that . . . that have been with us through this whole process but for the family, they very much have this mentality of, ‘This is just how it is. This is how it’s meant to be. You can’t change it. We’ve all been through it’.

Oprah: ‘We’ve all been through the pressure. We’ve all been through being exploited’?

Harry: Yes. But what was different for me was the race element, because now it wasn’t just about her, but it is about what she represents. And therefore it wasn’t just affecting my wife. It was affecting so many other people as well. And that’s . . . that was the trigger for me to really engage in those conversations with Palace . . . senior Palace staff and with my family to say, ‘Guys, this is not going to end well’.

Oprah: And when you say ‘end well’, what did you mean?

24 He said he spoke to his father and grandmother multiple times before they broke the news Credit: Getty

Harry: For anyone it’s not going to end well. Because the way that I saw it was there was a way of doing things but for us — for this union and the specifics around her race — there was an opportunity, many opportunities, for my family to show some public support.

Oprah: Mmm.

Harry: And I guess one of the most telling parts — and the saddest parts, I guess — was over 70 Members of Parliament, female Members of Parliament, both Conservative and Labour — came out and called out the . . . the colonial undertones of articles and headlines written about

Meghan. Yet no one from my family ever said anything over those three years. And that . . . that hurts. But I also am acutely aware of where my family stand and how scared they are of the tabloids turning on them.

Oprah: Turning on them for what? They’re the Royal Family.

Harry: Yes, but it’s . . . there is this invisible . . . what’s termed or referred to as the ‘invisible contract’ behind closed doors between the institution and the tabloids, the UK tabloids.

Oprah: How so?

Harry: Well, it is . . . to simplify it, it’s a case of if you . . . if you as a family member are willing to wine, dine and give full access to these reporters, then you will get better press.

Oprah: What do you care about better press if you’re royal?

Harry: I think everyone needs to have some compassion for . . . for them in that situation, right? There is a level of control by fear that has existed for generations. I mean, generations.

Oprah: But who’s controlling whom? It’s the institution. From our point of view, just the public. It’s . . .

Harry: Yeah but the institution survives based on that, on that perception. So actually, if you don’t . . .

Oprah: So you’re saying there’s this relationship that Meghan was speaking of . . . it’s like, symbiotic. One lives or thrives because the other exists.

Meghan: Mmm.

Oprah: That’s what you’re saying.

Harry: That’s the . . . that’s the idea.

Meghan: Well, see, I think there’s a reason that these tabloids have holiday parties at the Palace. They’re hosted by the Palace, the tabloids are. You know, there is a construct that’s at play there. And because from the beginning of our relationship, they were so attacking and inciting so much racism, really, it changed our . . . the risk level, because it went . . . it wasn’t just catty gossip. It was bringing out a part of people that was racist in how it was charged. And that changed the threat. That changed the level of death threats. That changed everything.

Oprah: So, tell me this: You said a moment ago, it hurts that your family has never acknowledged the role that racism played in here. Did you think she was well received in the beginning?

Harry: Yes. Far better than I expected. (Laughter) But, you know, my grandmother has been amazing throughout. You know, my father, my brother, Kate and . . . and all the rest of the family, they were, they were really welcoming. But it really changed after the Australia tour, after our South Pacific tour.

Meghan: That’s when we announced we were pregnant with Archie. That was our first tour.

Harry: But it was also . . . it was also the first time that the family got to see how incredible she is at the job. And that brought back memories.

Oprah: I’m thinking, because I watch The Crown OK? I watch The Crown. Do you all watch The Crown?

Meghan: (Laughs)

Harry:: I’ve watched some of it. You’ve watched some of it?

Meghan: I’ve watched some of it.

Oprah: But there’s this . . . I think it was the fourth season, actually, where there is an Australian tour. So, is that what you’re talking about? It brought back memories of that? The Australian tour.

24 Harry said he was 'trapped within the system' until he met Meghan Credit: Getty

Harry: Yeah.

Oprah: Where your father and your mother went there, and your mother was bedazzling. So, are you saying that there were hints of jealousy?

Harry: Look, I just wish that we would all learn from the past. But to see the . . . to see how effortless it was for Meghan to come into the family so quickly in Australia and across New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga, and just be able to connect with people in such a . . .

Oprah: But . . .

Harry: I know, I know, I know, I know. But it’s . . .

Oprah: Why, I mean, why wouldn’t everybody love that? Isn’t that what you want? You want her to come into the family and to, as the Queen said at one point, the way that Meghan had basically, not her words, been assimilated into the family.

Harry: Yeah, I think, you know, as we talked about, she was very much welcomed into the family, not just by the family, but by the world.

Oprah: Yeah.

Harry: Certainly by the Commonwealth. I mean, here you have one of the greatest assets to the Commonwealth that the family could have ever wished for.

Oprah: I just can’t . . . I’m kind of going back to this. So, then, you’re in Canada because you had stepped back. Your Firm says you’re no longer going to have protection. So, did you ask for that? Because did you want . . . were you trying to have it both ways? You wanted to step back but also keep your foot in royal business, it seems.

Harry: It’s interesting that you talk about it being, you know, ‘Have it both ways’ on the . . . on the security element. I never thought that I would have my security removed, because I was born into this position. I inherited the risk. So that was a shock to me. That was what completely changed the whole plan.

Oprah: So, that you as Prince Harry are going to have your security removed.

Meghan: Yeah. And I even . . . and I even wrote letters to his family saying, ‘Please, it’s very clear the protection of me or Archie is not a priority. I accept that. That is fine. Please keep my husband safe. I see the death threats. I see the racist propaganda. Please keep him safe. Please don’t pull his security and announce to the world when he and we are most vulnerable’. And they said it’s just not possible.

Oprah: Mm-hmm. I think what we really have got to clear up here is because one of the stories that continues to live, either through rumours or social media, out in the world, is that you, Meghan, are the one who manipulated, calculated, and are responsible for this Megxit.

Meghan: Oh, my gosh. It’s amazing how they can use Meg for everything.

Oprah: Yes. There are even stories that you knew all along that this was going to happen. You went through the whole process, and it was all intentional to build your brand.

Meghan: Can you imagine how little sense that makes? I left my career, my life. I left everything because I love him, right? And our plan was to do this for ever.

Harry: Yes.

Meghan: Our plan . . . for me, I mean, I wrote letters to his family when I got there, saying, ‘I am dedicated to this. I’m here for you. Use me as you’d like’. There was no guidance, as well, right? There were certain things that you couldn’t do. But, you know, unlike what you see in the movies, there’s no class on how to . . . how to speak, how to cross your legs, how to be royal. There’s none of that training. That might exist for other members of the family. That was not something that was offered to me.

Oprah: So, nobody tells you anything?

Meghan: No.

Oprah: Nobody prepares you?

Meghan: Nobody even . . .

Harry: There’s . . .

Meghan: Sorry, but even down to, like, the National Anthem. No one thought to say, ‘Oh, you’re American. You’re not going to know that’. That’s me late at night, Googling how . . . what’s the National . . . I’ve got to learn this. I don’t want to embarrass them. I need to learn these 30 hymns for church. All of this is televised. We were doing the training behind the scenes, because I just wanted to make them proud.

Oprah: OK, but here’s the question: Do you think you would have left or ever stepped back were it not for Meghan?

Meghan: Hm.

Harry: No. The answer to your question is no.

Oprah: You would not have?

Harry: I wouldn’t have . . . I wouldn’t have been able to, because I myself was trapped as well. I didn’t see a way out.

Oprah: She felt trapped, you were trapped?

Harry: Yeah, I didn’t see a way out.

Oprah: But you’d this life, your whole life. This has been your life your whole life.

24 He claimed William and Charles are also trapped but 'they don't get to leave' Credit: Instagram

Harry: Yeah, but, you know, I was trapped, but I didn’t know I was trapped.

Oprah: Mmm.

Harry: But the moment that I met Meg, and then our worlds sort of collided in the most amazing of ways, and then to see how . . .

Oprah: Please explain how you, Prince Harry, raised in a palace and a life of privilege — literally, a Prince . . . how you were trapped.

Harry: Trapped within the system, like the rest of my family are. My father and my brother, they are trapped. They don’t get to leave. And I have huge compassion for that.

Oprah: Well, OK, so the impression of the world — maybe it’s a false impression — is that, for all these years before Meghan, you were living your life as a royal, Prince Harry . . . the beloved Prince Harry and that you were enjoying that life. We didn’t get the impression that you were feeling trapped in that life.

Harry: Enjoying the life because there were photographs of me smiling while I was shaking hands and meeting people? Like, I’m sure you guys have covered some of that. That’s . . . that’s a part of the job. That’s a part of the role. That’s what’s expected. No matter who you are in the family, no matter what’s going on in your personal life, no matter what’s just happened, if the bikes roll up and the car rolls up, you’ve got to get dressed, you got to get in there. You wipe your tears away, shake off whatever you’re thinking about and you got to be on your A-game.

Oprah: Mm-hmm. What would you think your mum would say about this stepping back, this decision to step back from the Royal Family? How would she feel about this moment?

Harry: I think she would feel very angry with how this has panned out, and very sad. But, ultimately, she’d . . . all she’d . . . all she’d ever want is for us to be happy.

Oprah: You wanted freedom from . . . from that life? You wanted freedom to make your own money. You wanted freedom to make deals with Netflix and Spotify. But you also wanted to serve the Queen?

Harry: Yeah, we didn’t want to . . . we didn’t want to give up, or we didn’t want to turn our backs on the associations and the people that we . . . that we’ve been supporting.

Meghan: But also, Oprah, it exists.

Harry: Yeah, it exists. But, also, the Netflix and the Spotify, they’re all . . . that was never part of the plan.

Meghan: Yeah.

Oprah: Because you didn’t have a plan?

Meghan: We didn’t have a plan.

Harry: We didn’t have a plan. That was suggested by somebody else by the point of where my family literally cut me off financially, and I had to afford . . . afford security for us.

Oprah: Wait. Hold . . . hold up. Wait a minute. Your family cut you off?

Harry: Yeah, in the first half, the first quarter of 2020. But I’ve got what my mum left me, and, without that, we would not have been able to do this.

Oprah: OK.

Harry: So, you know, touching back on what you asked me, what my mum would think of this, I think she saw it coming. And I certainly felt her presence throughout this whole process. And, you know, for me, I’m . . . I’m just really relieved and happy to be sitting here talking to you with my wife by my side. Because I can’t begin to imagine what it must have been like for her going through this process by herself all those years ago, because it’s been unbelievably tough for the two of us, but at least we had each other.

Oprah: What’s your relationship like now with your family?

Harry: I’ve spoken more to my grandmother in the last year than I have done for many, many years.

Oprah: Do you all have Zoom calls?

Harry: We did a couple of Zoom calls with Archie.

Meghan: Sometimes, yes, so they can see Archie.

Oprah: Yeah.

Harry: My grandmother and I have a really good relationship . . .

24 Harry said he thinks Diana would be angry 'with how this has panned out' Credit: Getty

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Harry: . . . And an understanding. And I have a deep respect for her. She’s my Colonel-In-Chief, right? She always will be.

Oprah: Your relationship with your father? Is he taking your calls now?

Harry: Yeah. Yeah, he is. There’s a lot to work through there, you know? I feel really let down, because he’s been through something similar. He knows what pain feels like, and this is . . . and Archie’s his grandson. And . . . but, at the same time, you know, I, of course I will always . . . I will always love him, but there’s a lot of hurt that’s happened. And . . . and I will continue to . . . to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that relationship. And, but they only know what they know, and that’s the thing. I’ve tried to . . .

Meghan: Or what they’re told.

Harry: Or what they’re told. And I’ve tried to educate them through the process that I have been educated.

Oprah: Because is it like being in a big royal bubble?

Harry: Yeah.

Oprah: Yeah. And your brother? Relationship? Much has been said about that.

Harry: Yeah, and much will continue to be said about that. You know, as I’ve said before, I love William to bits. He’s my brother. We’ve been through hell together. I mean, we have a shared experience. But we . . . you know, we’re on . . . we’re on different paths.

Oprah: Well, what is particularly striking is what Meghan shared with us earlier, is that no one wants to admit that there’s anything about race or that race has played a role in the trolling and the vitriol, and yet Meghan shared with us that there was a conversation with you about Archie’s skin tone.

Harry: Mm-hmm.

Oprah: What was that conversation?

Harry: That conversation I’m never going to share, but at the time . . . at the time, it was awkward. I was a bit shocked.

Oprah: Can you . . . can you tell us what the question was?

Harry: No. I don’t . . . I’m not comfortable with sharing that.

Oprah: OK.

Harry: But that was . . . that was right at the beginning, right?

Oprah: Like, what will the baby look like?

Harry: Yeah, what will the kids look like?

Oprah: What will the kids look like?

Harry: But that was right at the beginning, when she wasn’t going to get security, when members of my family were suggesting that she carries on acting, because there was not enough money to pay for her, and all this sort of stuff. Like, there was some real obvious signs before we even got married that this was going to be really hard.

Oprah: So, in conclusion, if you’d had the support, you’d still be there?

Harry: Without question.

Meghan: Yeah.

24 He said 'I think she saw it coming, and I certainly felt her presence throughout this process' Credit: Getty

Harry: I’m sad that . . . that what’s happened has happened, but I know, and I’m comfortable in knowing, that we did everything that we could to make it work. And we did everything on the exit process the way that . . . the way that it should have been done.

Meghan: With as much respect.

Harry: With as much respect.

Meghan: And, oh, my God, we just did everything we could to . . . to protect them.

Oprah: So, what do you say to the people who say you came here, you made these multimillion-dollar deals and that you’re just money-grabbing royals?

Harry: First off, this was never the intention.

Oprah: Mm-hmm.

Meghan: Yeah.

Harry: And we’re certainly not complaining. We . . . our life is great now. We’ve got a beautiful house. We’ve got a beautiful . . . I’ve got a beautiful family. And the dogs . . . the dogs are really happy. But at the time, during Covid, the suggestion by a friend was, ‘What about streamers?’

Meghan: Yeah, we genuinely hadn’t thought about that before.

Harry: We hadn’t thought about it. So there were all sorts of different options. And, look, from my perspective, all I needed was enough money to be able to pay for security to keep my family safe.

Oprah: Mm. How will you use Archewell as a means of speaking to things that are important to you in the world?

Meghan: I think in creating . . . I mean, life is about storytelling, right? About the stories we tell ourselves, the stories we’re told, what we buy into. And . . . and for us to be able to have storytelling through a truthful lens, that hopefully is uplifting, is going to be great knowing how many people that can land with. And being able to give a voice to a lot of people that are under-represented and aren’t really heard.

Oprah: Any regrets?

Meghan: This morning, I woke up earlier than H and saw a note from someone on our team in the UK saying the Duke of Edinburgh had gone to the hospital.

Oprah: Yeah.

Meghan: But I just picked up the phone and I called the Queen just to check in.

Oprah: You check in?

Meghan: Just like, I would . . . you know . . . that’s what we do. It’s like, being able to default to not having to every moment go, ‘Is that appropriate?’

Oprah: Yeah.

Harry: For so many in my family, what they do is . . . there’s a level of control in it, right? Because they’re fearful of what the papers are going to say about them.

Oprah: Yeah.

Harry: Whereas with us, it was just, like, just be . . . just be yourself. Just be genuine. Just be authentic. Just go and do what it is. If you get it wrong, you get it wrong. If you get it right, you get it right.

(Oprah narrates) On February 19, 2021, Buckingham palace released a statement announcing it was agreed that Prince Harry and Meghan would not return as working members of the Royal Family. Harry and Meghan’s royal patronages and Prince Harry’s honorary military titles would be returned to the Queen. The Queen’s statement was released after our interview took place. (Back to Oprah)

Oprah: Your exit agreement with the Royal Family, it’s . . . that is coming up at the end of this month.

Harry: The decision is, I think. Yeah, I mean, the decision — what, as of last week, or whatever it was — is that they will be removing everything.

24 The Sussexes said they have no regrets about stepping back Credit: AFP or licensors

Oprah: Are you hurt by that decision?

Harry: I am hurt. But at the same time I completely respect my grandmother’s decision. I would still love for us to be able to continue to support those associations, albeit without the title or the role.

Oprah: Could you be as satisfied now, doing this through your own organisation, Archewell?

Meghan: Well, we . . . this is what we’re doing, right? We’re still doing it. We’re still going to always do the work. But I also think it’s important for you or everyone to know this decision that was made about patronages and all of that was before anyone knew that we were sitting down with you.

Harry: Yeah.

Meghan: I think that it’s . . . I can only imagine . . .

Oprah: I heard a story that you’re getting punished now. Those were being taken away because you did sit down with me.

Meghan: Yeah, but that was . . . those letters, those conversations, that was . . . that was finalised before anyone even knew that we were going to sit down. So that’s just not true.

Oprah: All right, tell me this. Harry, what delights you now in your everyday experience and the things that you actually cherish in your life here with Archie and Meghan?

Harry: This year has been crazy for everybody. But to have outdoor space where I can go for walks with Archie, and we can go for walks as a family and with the dogs, and we can go on hikes — we’ll go down to the beach, which is so close — all of these things are just . . . I guess, the highlight for me is sticking him on the back of the bicycle in his little baby seat and taking him on these bike rides, which is something I was never able to do when I was young. I can see him on the back and he’s got his arms out and he’s like, ‘Whoo!’ chatting, chatting, chatting, going, ‘Palm tree! House!’ and all this sort of stuff. And I do . . . I think to myself . . .

In some ways it's just the beginning. Greater than any fairytale you've ever read...

Oprah: What’s his new favourite word? What’s his favourite word now?

Meghan: Oh my gosh, he’s on a roll. In the past couple weeks it has been hydrate, which is just hysterical.

Harry: But also, whenever everyone leaves the house, he’s like, ‘Drive safe’.

Meghan: ‘Drive safe’.

(Oprah laughs)

Harry: Which is really . . .

Meghan: He’s not even two yet!

Oprah: You said that your brother was trapped. You said that you love your brother and always will love your brother. You didn’t tell me what the relationship is now, though.

Harry: The relationship is space at the moment. And, you know, time heals all things, hopefully.

Oprah: Any regrets?

Harry: No. I mean . . . no, I think we’ve done . . . I’m really proud of us, you know? I’m so proud of . . . I’m so proud of my wife. Like, she safely delivered Archie during a period of time which was so cruel and so mean. And every single day, I was coming back from work, from London, I was coming back to my wife crying while breastfeeding Archie. That’s coming from someone who wasn’t reading anything. And as she touched on earlier, if she had read anything, she wouldn’t be here now. So we did what we had to do — and now we’ve got another little one on the way.

Meghan: I have one. My regret is believing them when they said I would be protected. I believed that. And I regret believing that because I think, ‘had I really seen that that wasn’t happening, I would have been able to do more’. But I think I wasn’t supposed to see it. I wasn’t supposed to know. And . . . and now, because we’re actually on the other side, we’ve actually not just survived but are thriving. You know, this . . . I mean, this is miracles. I . . . yeah, I think that all of those things that I was hoping for have happened . . . and this is in some ways just the beginning for us. You know, we’ve been through a lot. It’s felt like a lifetime. (Laughs.) A lifetime.

Oprah: So, your story with the prince does have a happy ending?

Meghan: It does.

Harry: Yeah.

Meghan: Yeah. (Laughs.) It really did.

Oprah: It has a happy ending because you made it so.

Meghan: Yeah, greater than any fairytale you’ve ever read.

Oprah: Greater than any fairytale.

Meghan: Yeah, yeah.

Oprah: What you’ve described here today — being trapped and not even being aware of it and all the things that had transpired, and then she comes into your life and then you’re doing therapy — do you think in some way she saved you?

Harry: Yeah. Without question. There was . . . there was a bigger purpose. There was other forces at play, I think, throughout this whole process. I’m the last person to think, ‘Ooh!’ You know? But it’s undeniable when these things have happened, where the overlap is. So yeah, she did. Without question she saved me.

Meghan: And I would . . . I would . . . I mean, I think that’s lovely. I would disagree. I think he saved all of us, right? He ultimately called it and was like, ‘We’ve got to find a way for us, for Archie’. And you made a decision that saved . . . certainly saved my life and saved all of us. But, you know, you need to want to be saved.

Oprah: Well, thank you for sharing your love story. We can’t wait for the big day some time this summer.

Meghan: Yes, indeed.

Oprah: Sometime this summer.

Meghan: Yeah.

Oprah: Thank you both for trusting me to share your story.

Anna Friel returns as the troubled detective for season three - so here is a quick recap of the first two series of the hit ITV show.

WARNING: Contains major spoilers from seasons 1 and 2 of Marcella.

What happened in Marcella season 1?

In season 1, Marcella Backland had taken a break from her job as a police detective to dedicate more time to her family.

But she is pulled back into it when a case that had gone unsolved fifteen years ago comes back into the focus.

A serial killer is going around town killing people by suffocating them to death.

The return of the killer allows Marcella another opportunity to get closure with the case, while also distracting herself from the personal problems in her life.

4 ITV series Marcella is full of twists and turns

Despite several fresh murders, the case takes a more urgent turn when Grace Gibson is killed.

She is the daughter of Sylvie Gibson, a wealthy and influential business owner, who also happens to be the employer of Marcella’s husband, Jason.

It then turned out that Sylvie's stepson Henry was the killer and he confessed to all the murders.

He said he killed Grace because she was the favoruyite child and committed the other murders to cover up his first crime

What happened in Marcella season 2?

This time there was a child killer on the loose.

While renovating his house, a man discovers a dead body inside the wall that separates his apartment from the next-door person’s.

He calls the cops, and Marcella is a part of the team that investigates it.

The moment she sees the decaying corpse of the child, she recognises him - it is her son Edward’s friend, Leo, who had disappeared a couple of years ago.

4 Bothe season 1 and 2 focused on serial killers

As the investigation proceeds, more dead bodies surface, and several past disappearances also come to light.

After spending much of the series hunting for a man, Marcella then worked out the serial killer was in fact a woman called Jane Colletti.

She had been murdering children in order to “keep the evil in” and stop them from growing up to become abusers.

However, in a turn of events, Marcella's mental state took a turn for the worse, and she faked her own death.

Baroness Jones insisted men ""don't understand the pressure women are under"" after her comments in The House Of Lords sparked a massive debate.

Speaking after the alleged kidnap and murder of Sarah Everard, 33, she told a debate in the upper chamber this week that a ban on men being outdoors after 6pm would “make women a lot safer”.

The peer today admitted her curfew suggestion wasn't ""entirely serious, as I don't have the power to do that"", but welcomed any ""intense scrutiny"".

A vigil for Sarah and women who feel unsafe and face violence is planned for tomorrow in South London after organisers mounted a legal challenge following a police warning it would be unlawful.

Baroness Jones told Sky News: ""Nobody makes a fuss when the police suggest women stay at home, but when I suggest it, men are up in arms.

'MYSOGINISTIC'

""You should see my inbox. It's full of misogynistic and racist emails to me.

""Men just don't understand the pressure that women are under and if this has sparked intense scrutiny then I'm really happy.""

She had told Wednesday's debate on domestic violence that a curfew could help cut down cases of discrimination too.

She said: ""In the week that Sarah Everard was abducted and, we suppose, killed — because remains have been found in a woodland in Kent — I argue that, at the next opportunity for any Bill that is appropriate, I might put in an amendment to create a curfew for men on the streets after 6pm.

""I feel this would make women a lot safer, and discrimination of all kinds would be lessened.""

Her comments came after human remains were found in the case of Sarah, who went missing after leaving a friend's house in Clapham last week.

Cops haven't yet confirmed it is her, but a serving Met Police cop has been arrested over her kidnap and murder.

Speaking this morning after her curfew call faced a backlash, Baroness Jones said: ""It's not an entirely serious suggestion as I don't have the power to do that.

'VICTIM-BLAME'

""I was just trying to highlight that when police victim-blame by telling women to stay home, we don't react, we just think it's normal.

""When I suggest it about men, everyone's up in arms. What's the difference? The difference is that there's misogyny out there. We need to fix it.""

A Government source has dismissed her curfew suggestion as ""totally bonkers"".

They said it would be a ""massive curtailing of basic freedoms and rights"" and would never work.

It's not an entirely serious suggestion as I don't have the power to do that Baroness Jones

Caroline Nokes, Tory MP and Chair of the Women and Equalities Committee also said it was a mad suggestion.

She told The Sun: ""You can't go around slapping curfews on one gender.

""Any solution to the real fear that women feel is going to have to be a lot more complex than that.

""It's a bonkers suggestion - but it has got us all talking about what practical steps men can take to make women feel safer.""

Baroness Jones went on to back a cross-party bid to make misogyny and hatred against women a specific hate crime.

She said: ""If anyone is being advised to stay at home it should be men, not women.

“This kind of murder is rare, but very scary. What is far more regular are the sexual assaults, threats, intimidation, cat calling and rude remarks that women face every day.

“If the police did their job this misogynistic culture wouldn't thrive the way it has. Men wouldn't assume that they could get away with it. The police have failed on rape and sexual assault for years. They have mostly failed on domestic abuse. There needs to be some serious action at the Met to turn this around and give women the protection they deserve.

“We need to make misogyny a hate crime, as that would get the root of many of these other crimes.""

An amendment to the Domestic Abuse Bill - due to be debated in Parliament on Monday - would require all police forces in England and Wales to record where existing crimes have been motivated by hatred of someone’s sex or gender.

Sarah vanished last week as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham, South West London - and hasn't been seen since.

She left there around 9pm, phoned her boyfriend on the way, but is believed never to have arrived home.

PC Wayne Couzens, 48, is being held on suspicion of her abduction and murder.

The 48-year-old father-of-two is a Met Police armed diplomatic protection officer stationed in Westminster.

COP ARRESTED

The Metropolitan Police confirmed human remains have been found in Ashford, Kent, but said they had not yet been identified.

It is 30 miles from the Deal home where Met Police gun cop was arrested on Tuesday night on suspicion of Sarah’s kidnap.

It's not believed the pair knew each other beforehand.

One line of inquiry is that he may have lured Sarah into his vehicle out of view of CCTV cameras.

His work saw him provide protection at major public events attended by senior members of the Royal Family.

It comes after thousands of women have taken to social media to share stories about how they too don't feel safe on Britain's streets.

A vigil is being held in Clapham, South London, at the weekend, for women to ""take back control"" of the streets, amid an outpouring of fear and emotion.

Organisers Reclaim These Streets have launched a High Court appeal after saying cops threatened them with prosecution under Covid rules.

The head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick tried to reassure women earlier this week that it was still safe, but admitted people would be scared.

Shesaid: ""I know Londoners will want to know that it is thankfully incredibly rare for a woman to be abducted from our streets.

""But I completely understand that despite this, women in London and the wider public - particularly those in the area where Sarah went missing - will be worried and may well be feeling scared.""

18 More demonstrations are planned on Easter Saturday, including a rally in London

Rallies are due to take place in London, Plymouth and Bourmemouth over the bank holiday weekend, with sunny weather expected.

Eighteen people were arrested in Manchester at one demonstration yesterday.

Boris Johnson blasted the Kill the Bill ""mob"" after cops arrested 10 protesters following violent clashes in Bristol on Friday night.

The protests have been sparked after a new policing bill which would see protests criminalised when deemed a ""public nuisance"".

'KILL THE BILL' FURY

Riot cops in Bristol used shields to push back thousands of booing demonstrators who threw fireworks along with bottles and eggs at police on the third night of chaos in less than a week.

The chaotic scenes saw a number of arrests overnight as the protesters and more than 100 cops armed with shields and helmets faced off in the streets.

One of the detained rioters was issued with a fixed penalty notice while the other nine remain in custody, cops said.

Mr Johnson called the attacks against officers ""disgraceful"" and gave the police his ""full support"".

The prime minister said: ""Last night saw disgraceful attacks against police officers in Bristol.

""Our officers should not have to face having bricks, bottles and fireworks being thrown at them by a mob intent on violence and causing damage to property.

""The police and the city have my full support.""

Home Secretary Priti Patel shamed the 'troublesome' demonstrators, saying: ""I am disgusted by the disorder in Bristol and the violence being directed towards the police.

""I’m in no doubt the silent, law-abiding majority will be appalled by the actions of this criminal minority.

TEN ARRESTED

""Despite repeated warnings to disperse, it’s clear these thugs were only intent on causing trouble. I am receiving regular updates and the police have my full support.""

In Manchester, dozens of sit-down proteseters blocked Portland Street in the city centre in a ""largely peaceful"" demonstration, police said.

Other Kill the Bill rallies were held in London, Brighton and Bath.

Around 1,000 people had gathered in Bristol on Friday night after violence at two confrontations in the city in the week before.

18 The Home Secretary called the protesters 'thugs' who were 'intent on causing trouble'

Chaos kicked off quickly yet again with fireworks sent flying towards a police horse during the scuffles as cops tried to move on the protesters.

Video posted on social media appeared to show a journalist being pushed by police officers.

Officers warned protesters force would be used - with mounted officers on horses and dogs on standby.

The baying crowd chanted “shame on you” as they were pushed back.

Other protesters were spotted with shopping bags full of alcohol after police put a restriction on city-centre shops from selling booze.

Earlier police formed a ring of steel around Bridewell Police Station, which was attacked in previous carnage.

The protests have been held in Bristol over the past week, protesting against the Government's Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill.

And during Friday's demonstrations protesters could be heard chanting ""ten years for protest, five years for rape"" and ""justice for Sarah"", referring to the recent murder of Sarah Everard in London.

Demonstrations last Sunday and Tuesday had also started peacefully before descending into assaults against police and acts of vandalism.

The young man, who has been identified only by his first name - Sergei - has gone on trial with charges of statutory rape at a court in the town of Volsk, in the Russian federal subject of Saratov Oblast.

The trial follows the flaunting of his ‘relationship’ with the girl, who is now 14, on social media.

The girl, who has been identified as ‘Lyuba’, features in videos posted to Sergia’s social accounts.

And according to local media, Sergei shockingly cheated on his wife on their wedding day with the underage girl.

He reportedly went missing from the occasion in 2019 for several hours.

His marriage to his new wife, who has been identified as Victoria, apparently only lasted for a short while.

The couple parted ways after their son's birth.

According to local news outlet Wolsk, Victoria said at the time: ""I just got tired of Sergei's lies, his adventures with Lyuba, even though he said they were not communicating.""

Following the couple's split, Sergei entered into a full-time 'relationship' with Lyuba, who according to local media, is now pregnant.

3 Sergei has been described as a ""very deceitful and shifty person"" by his ex-wife Credit: Newsflash

It was not revealed why her parents and authorities seemingly failed to act to stop what was happening.

Once their relationship became public knowledge, he attempted to marry her to 'formalise' the pair's relationship - a move suspected to be an attempt to avoid being charged for statutory rape.

However, this application was rejected by the registry office.

In Russia, the age of consent for marriages is 18.

Marriage at 17 is permitted with parental consent. Marriage at 16 is permitted with parental consent if one of the partners is over 18.

According to Sergei's ex-wife, her alleged paedophile husband has also refused to pay child support for their son.

She has claimed that his apparent remorse during his trial over the decisions he had made was pure theatre.

Insiders say those affected would not be qualified to safely skate having missed up to two weeks of training.

Previously, celebs would have been allowed a bye but only for one week.

Rufus had already missed two weeks of Dancing On Ice after being told he must self isolate after getting a Test and Trace notification.

He subsequently tested positive for Covid-19 meaning he had to stay at home by law.

Megan Younger-Watson, 17, who was described by her family as “beautiful, polite and funny” was allegedly sexually assaulted after drinking in a pub.

Suffolk Coroner’s Court in Ipswich heard how she was “distraught” when she told friends of the attack as they walked home from the party in a flat.

She was found dead the next morning in her room at her supported housing accommodation hostel Christchurch House, Ipswich, Suffolk.

Detective Inspector Daniel Connick of Suffolk Police said the alleged rape had been investigated and a male suspect was identified after Megan’s death.

He was never brought to court after the CPS decided against bringing charges, the hearing was told.

'DISTRAUGHT'

But Det Insp Connick said it was “apparent” that Megan would have been “too intoxicated” to consent to sex.

The inquest heard on Tuesday was told Megan, went to a party in a flat with pals where Megan reported being raped.

Fellow residents of Christchurch House described carrying Megan back to the hostel where CCTV showed her in a corridor in an intoxicated state.

Megan was carried upstairs twice by the night concierge and was last seen on CCTV at around 8am entering her partner's room where an argument started.

She later calmed down and returned to her own room, the inquest was told.

Friends dialled 999 at around 10am after getting no response from her room.

The inquest heard how paramedics and police found her dead inside after breaking the door down and were unable to revive her.

Megan’s mother, Natashia Younger-Watson, said she felt more could have been done to protect her daughter on the night she did.

Ms Younger-Watson said she was concerned nobody in charge was alerted to her daughter’s mental state and questioned why she was left alone, despite still being a child.

Mr Chigome said the concierge had tried to ensure Megan was safe, but the inquest heard how he had not contacted the on-call manager over any concerns.

Megan was one of the most wonderful, bubbliest, happiest people you’d ever meet Megan's mum

The coroner pointed to two “missed opportunities” where advice was not sought from NHS 111 about how to deal with Megan, and the duty manager not informed.

He also raised concerns about the extent of CCTV coverage in Christchurch House and said he would be requesting more information about it, requiring a response within 28 days.

Mr Parsley said he felt Megan’s behaviour on the night before she died seemed “out of character”.

Her father, Stuart Haggar, said she appeared to have turned a corner and had been on a “confident road to adulthood” in the year before she died.

He said she had starting driving lessons and was enjoying her college course.

'SHE WAS AMAZING'

Megan’s medical cause of death was given as compression of the neck, consistent with hanging.

The inquest was told how Megan who was studying performing arts at Suffolk New College in Ipswich had been diagnosed with PTSD after an abusive relationship in her early teens.

She moved to Christchurch House for more independence while seeking help for anxiety and depression, which had led to her self-harming and attempting overdoses in the past.

The night of her death Megan was out celebrating after overcoming some engagement issues to be allowed to stay in her accommodation.

Megan’s mother paid tribute to her after her death, saying she was “beautiful, inside and out” and was “thriving” in the weeks before she died.

She said: “Megan was one of the most wonderful, bubbliest, happiest people you’d ever meet.

“She put everyone before herself, that’s why there’s been such a big tribute to her. She was absolutely amazing.”

I was a teenager and had just been to watch Erasure perform in concert at Whitley Bay Ice Rink in the North East.

9 A new survey revealed 97 per cent of women aged between 18 and 24 have been sexually harassed Credit: Getty

I was excited. It was my first ever concert, my first night out without my parents watching over me.

But as I walked home, past a bus stop, a man started making suggestive comments towards me. I still know exactly what he said more than 20 years later and remember how I ran off in the other direction.

Since then, I’ve had times when men — usually drunk, or groups of lads — have shouted suggestive remarks and unwanted comments after a night out.

Now, when walking home late at night, I always look over my shoulder and often make a phone call, real or fictitious, just in case there is somebody waiting to pounce.

Until this week, I have never really given much of a second thought to what happened all those years ago, or how I behave now.

My teenage experience is far from unusual and I just do what every other woman does now to try to stay safe. We don’t all question it, we just do it.

But the killing of Sarah Everard has sent shockwaves across the country and got women thinking about the issue of safety while walking Britain’s streets.

A new survey by UN Women UK has revealed 97 per cent of women aged between 18 and 24 — and 80 per cent of all women — have been victims of sexual harassment.

The figures are shocking. Something needs to be done to reverse them. Now.

9 The killing of Sarah Everard has got women thinking about the issue of safety on Britain's streets

Sexual harassment isn’t just physical, it is verbal and psychological too. It can include unwanted comments, leering, vulgar sexual and racist remarks, threats, touching, groping or indecent exposure.

There is a call for sexual harassment against women on the street to become a new criminal offence, following the murder of 33-year-old marketing executive Sarah.

It is being backed by Nimco Ali, a feminist campaigner appointed by Home Secretary Priti Patel to advise on the Government’s new strategy to combat sexual violence against women and girls.

She said: “Street harassment is absolutely a form of violence towards women and girls and it currently goes unreported and unpunished.”

Green Party peer Jenny Jones even made the — as she put it “not entirely serious” — suggestion of a 6pm curfew for men.

That is just as stupid as blaming the women themselves, or the outfits they are wearing for the reason they get harassed.

FIGURES RISING

None of this deals with the cause.

And the cause is some men — definitely not all — who seem to think it is OK to treat women in the way they are doing.

In 2014, the figures for sexual harassment in public places were much lower than they are now.

A survey by the EU Fundamental Rights Agency found 68 per cent of all women in the UK had experienced it and 85 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds.

Figures are rising year on year.

Men need to know what it feels like to be a woman when they are harassed in this way. The only people that can truly explain this perspective are women.

This week on social media, women started to explain what they had been through and what scared them — and men listened and asked what they could do in return.

The figures are shocking. Something needs to be done to reverse them. Now.

Some men, perhaps, do need to be told how to behave, to be given guidelines. Some may think the way they speak or act towards women is acceptable when it very much isn’t.

Families need to do their bit. Because it is sons, brothers, fathers, uncles and nephews who are doing this to women.

Today, on Mother’s Day, is a perfect place to start. For mums to tell their little — and big — boys, that sexual harassment in any form is never acceptable.

And just as importantly to try to explain to them how uncomfortable, scared and humiliated it makes women feel.

Then the next generation may not need to worry about clutching their keys to use as a weapon in a dark car park, or being made to feel bad for wearing a skimpy skirt.

My son is only two, but as soon as he is old enough to understand I will explain this to him.

Because women have a right to feel safe. And mums want to be proud of their sons.

THE Duchess of Cambridge proved this week that she will one day be the perfect female lead member of The Firm.

On Thursday, she and William went to an East London school. It was their first public appearance together since Harry and Meghan’s Oprah chat.

Kate ticked boxes for style, fashion and absolute dignity.

She may just have had a load of mud flung in her face by her sister-in- law – and will probably never get her chance to hit back – but she didn’t flinch for a second when William, who was standing right next to her, responded to questions about racism by saying: “We’re very much not a racist family.”

She definitely deserves a deep curtsy . . . if you know how to do one.

Caitlin's not blue CAITLIN BRENNAN lives off beige foods. So that means fish fingers, chicken nuggets, skinless sausages, quiche, pasta and rice. She says: “I’ve eaten like this for 24 years and I’m fine, so it can’t be that bad. I can laugh and make a joke about it.” I feel her pain. I only like beige booze, in the form of white wine. And it could be a lot worse – imagine if she only liked blue.

NHS is there for us

SARAH HARDING is the Girls Aloud member who always seemed so full of enthusiasm, energy and . . . fun.

She said she was “a mess” being faced with her own mortality after her dreadful breast cancer diagnosis.

9 Sarah Harding's brave message is correct - listen to your body and use the NHS Credit: Getty

That is probably an understatement.

A few years ago, I had to sit in a sterile waiting room, with my partner holding my hand, waiting to find out if I had breast cancer. I will never forget the panic and terror I felt.

I was lucky. Tragically, Sarah now has advanced breast cancer and doesn’t know how long she has to live.

She has bravely written a book telling her fans about her experience. Her message is strong: Listen to your body and use the NHS.

Last year she was told Christmas 2020 would be her last. She is just 39. She says: “I don’t know how many months I have left. Maybe I’ll surprise everyone.”

I hope she does. Her story is a warning to get checked and to use your NHS.

We mustn’t forget it is there to protect us.

Piers leaves a hole

THE day after Piers Morgan stormed off Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid was left with the job of explaining his absence to viewers.

Her statement was drafted by bosses to give a neutral explanation of what happened. Now, with the big voice gone, that is what viewers can look forward to.

Yes, Piers overstepped the mark this week – complex issues such as mental health and suicide should not be flippantly dismissed. But he has the strength to give his honest opinion and start debates.

And if we are not careful, cancel culture – where individuals and brands are spurned due to stances that some perceive to be offensive – is going to get out of control.

The former Manchester City forward, 36, was accused of being involved in the gang-rape of an Albanian woman, then 22, at a Milan nightclub in 2013.

2 Robinho says he regrets cheating on his wife, Vivian, but claims he did not rape his accuser Credit: Instagram / @robinho

In 2017, Robinho was sentenced to nine years in prison.

But - having appealed the ruling - the Brazilian has now admitted to having 'contact' with the woman, but called it 'consensual'.

Robinho claims after he left, his friends also had consensual sexual intercourse with the woman - while adding he can't speak for them.

Key evidence used to convict the former Real Madrid star involved intercepted phone calls between Robinho and his friends.

It's claimed Robinho said the woman 'was completely drunk'.

But Robinho's legal team now claim the messages were mistranslated into Italian.

In an interview, Robinho told Brazilian outlet UOL: ""A girl approached me, we started to have contact with her consent and mine too... then I went home.

""When she approached me, she wasn't drunk, because she remembers my name, she remembers who I am.

2 Robinho was accused of raping a woman at a Milan nightclub in 2013

""The person who drinks doesn't remember anything. She remembers.""

However, Robinho did show remorse for his actions, saying he's 'changed for the better' in the last seven years.

Robinho - who has three children with wife Vivian, whom he married in 2009 - added: ""I regret cheating on my wife. This is my regret.

""Regarding the phrases that came out, [they were] out of context and to sell the newspaper and magazine.

""Obviously I changed a lot over the last seven years, this happened in 2013 and I changed for the better.

""The question is, what was the mistake I made? What was the crime I did?

""The mistake was not being faithful to my wife.

""I didn't make any mistake of raping someone, of abusing some girl or go out with her without her consent.""

Robinho recently signed for Santos for a meagre £200 per month after being released by Istanbul Basaksehir in the summer.

However, his deal has been put on ice until after his court case - which is still ongoing - comes to its conclusion.

A club statement read: ""Santos and Robinho have by mutual agreement resolved to suspend the contract signed on 10 October so that the player can concentrate exclusively on his court defence in Italy.""

The club's shirt sponsor, Orthopride, also cancelled their contract with the club 'in respect to women who use our product'.",['Dave Fraser'],"ROBINHO has denied claims he raped a woman - but had admitted to cheating on his wife after Santos suspended his contract following his sexual assault charge.

Ryan Murphy and Brad Fulchuk’s AHS has been a horror and gore fest since it began in 2011 with Murder House.

19 Lady Gaga stars in season five of AHS – Hotel Credit: Alamy

Since then it's taken us to an Asylum, practised with a Coven, entertained us with a Freak Show, stayed in a haunted Hotel, reminisced about Roanoke, explored a Cult, witnessed the Apocalypse and relived 1984.

Each time it seems the show can’t shock us anymore, it pulls out another sex toy-shaped knife and stabs us all over again.

Thanks to its stellar cast, originally led by Jessica Lange, each season has been beautifully pulled together to tell a captivating story with brutal and often horrifying scenes.

19 Sarah Paulson and Angela Bassett star in several of the seasons Credit: FX

Although Lange left after Freak Show in 2015, it still retained many of its original cast members including Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Lily Rabe, Billie Lourd, Kathy Bates and Finn Wittrock.

Season nine was the first chapter of American Horror Story to air without Paulson and Peters, but Murphy has teased they will be back for season 10.

Back in February the writer posted this short trailer for the next installment.

However, due to Covid-19, everything is most likely to have been pushed back.

In the meantime, here's a look down this grisly memory lane to remind you just why American Horror Story is one of the best shows of all time.

You’re welcome.

Murder House (2011)

There were lots of moments in Murder House that were shocking and gory but none more so than when the Rubber Man kills Chad and Patrick.

After Chad, played by Zachary Quinto, is drowned, the Rubber Man beats his boyfriend Patrick, played by Teddy Sears, with a fire iron.

If this wasn't bad enough, he finishes the job by sticking the metal rod up his bum. Granted you might not see it all but knowing where it went is enough to make you twitch.

19 The Rubber Man tries his luck with everyone Credit: Alamy

Another gross out scene is when young Violet realises she’s dead and that's why she can't leave the house.

Not only was looking at Violet's corpse grim to see, it was also heartbreaking.

When Taissa Farmiga’s character is taken to the basement by serial killer Tate and sees her own rotting body, it's hard for everyone to watch.

19 Violet dies of an overdose but it's not until she sees her own rotting body that she realises Credit: FX

Asylum (2012–13)

There are too many gore-tastic moments in this series to mention them all but special props has to go to the bit when Shelley [Chloë Sevigny] becomes a rasper and crawls up the stairs.

After suffering cruelly at the hands of Dr. Arden [James Cromwell], Shelley is dumped at a school.

Dragging herself, Shelley's amputated body and rotting skin are disgusting enough without the added horror of being found by children.

19 Justice for Shelley! Credit: FX

Asylum can't go by with the surprise revelation Dr. Thredson is actually Bloody Face.

After helping Lana escape Briarcliff, she quicky realises he’s the serial killer and wakes up chained to the floor of his torture room.

He then taunts her with Wendy’s dead body before putting on the Bloody Face mask with one new addition – her girlfriend's teeth.

19 Nymphomaniac Shelley is mutilated and turned into a rasper Credit: FX

Coven (2013–14)

Arguably one of the least gruesome of the nine series, Coven can still hold its own amongst the other horror scenes.

Kathy Bate's portrayal of Madame Delphine LaLaurie is hard to watch – not least because LaLaurie was a real person who did wicked things.

There's one especially brutal moment when she suffocates one of her slaves with the head of a bull.

19 Madame Delphine LaLaurie murders a man by suffocating him with a bull's head

That minotaur comes back later in the series and has sex with Queenie before ripping open her stomach with his horns.

Another award for grimmest moment of Coven has to be when Cordelia stabs herself in the eyes with the gardening shears.

After being blinded by acid she develops second sight but loses it when she's given the eyes of other witches (long story).

In order to get back what she lost, she takes the large scissors to her peepers. As you do.

19 Cordelia had an itch she just couldn't scratch until she found the gardening shears Credit: FX

Freak Show (2014–15)

Packed with moments that make you feel a bit sick, Freak Show was the Queen of AHS, Jessica Lange's, last season.

Twisty the Clown is hard to look at anyway but the scene when he stabs and butchers a couple in broad daylight is the stuff of nightmares.

Using a pair of rusty scissors, Twisty kills the boyfriend before realising the girl has made an escape and running after her.

19 Twisty the Clown makes Pennywise look almost normal Credit: FX

Is there anything more terrifying than being chased by a killer clown with half his face missing?

Possibly when viewers are treated to a flashback to manager of the freak show, Elsa Mars's past.

It shows that while working as a dominatrix in Germany, she was drugged and tricked into filming a snuff film.

Elsa's legs are hack her legs off with a chainsaw and she's left to perish.

19 His murder scenes are some of the most horrific in the entire franchise Credit: FX

Hotel (2015–16)

Enter Lady Gaga in all her glory, this season was based on the real murder hotel built by H.H.Holmes in Chicago.

There are many, many creepy moments in this series as it explores so many interlocking storylines.

Probably the most terrifying of all in the hotel is the Addiction Demon, who preys on guests who love to indulge.

19 The Addiction Demon murders his victims with a deadly strap on Credit: FX

The scene when he anally rapes drug addict Gabriel (Max Greenfield) with a drill-bit strap on is arguably one of the most 'WTF' moments in the series.

However, if you got past that then the scene where Lady Gaga and Matt Bomer's have a very bloody foursome might be slightly easier to watch.

It's the jabbing and stabbing of the throats that's really hard to watch, and then the licking of the blood makes it that much worse.

19 Meanwhile, Gaga has a taste for blood Credit: FX

Roanoke (2016)

A story in a story, this season took a little getting into for some viewers but it was definitely worth the wait.

In amongst the many gross out moments of the series is the scene when the ghost mob disembowel a guy on the family's garden.

The ghouls pull out his guts and arrange them artfully to send a warning to the rest of the family. What's wrong with a text?

19 Cannibals show their victims what's on the menu for dinner – them Credit: FX

However, for many viewers it was the deaths of the three millennial vloggers that really made an impact.

Influencers beware.

Shown from the perspective of their GoPro cameras, the found footage shows as a possessed Lee ignores their pleads for mercy and kills them old-school style: set ablaze on a wooden stake.

19 Kathy Bates is incredible as the leader of the human-munching gang

Cult (2017)

After the election of President Trump, this series capitalised on the fears many had about the future of the country.

The scary moments in this season could possibly be described as more subtle than other series.

However that's until Mr. Guinea Pig dies in the microwave. Blown up with blood on the door. Grim.

19 Poor Mr. Guinea Pig gets microwaved to death Credit: FX

Then there's also the moment when Ally and Ivy get into another squabble and Ivy coughs up blood.

Unbeknownst to her, Ally has served her arsenic and she dies a horrible and painful death.

Should have followed Cult rule no. 1 – stay away from the Kool Aid, Ally!

19 After an entire series of trying to kill her wife, Ally gets a taste of her own medicine Credit: FX

Apocalypse (2018)

A brief return from Jessica Lange, this series saw a crossover of three different seasons: Murder House, Coven and Hotel.

After Tate raped Vivien and the antichrist was born, we see what happens when the end of the world takes place.

Fans of the show were delighted to see the different seasons join and save Queenie from Hotel Cortez and even rescue Maddison from her own personal hell. LOL.

In the build up to end the world, Michael Langdon A.K.A. the antichrist must realise his true potential and to do that has to consume a human heart.

It's the moment when he tears her heart right out of her chest and eat it with no emotion that is sickening to see.

1984 (2019)

Where to begin? Possibly when Billy Lourd's character, Montana Duke, gets nasty on the bathroom floor with the Night Stalker.

She couldn't contain herself after he gutted an innocent gym goer and splayed his guts all over the wall.

Or there's the bit near the end when the ghosts of the camp kill evil Margaret by throwing her into the wood-chipper.

The host - who is presenting Good Morning Britain alongside Ben Shephard after Piers Morgan's shock resignation last week - spoke out before an interview this morning with Policing Minister Kit Malthouse.

She tackled ""shocking"" scenes at Clapham Common which saw women pinned to the ground and handcuffed - and pleaded for answers on how things had gone so badly wrong.

Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick is facing growing calls to resign over the chaos - although she's reportedly been backed by Boris Johnson to stay in her job.

""This was supposed to be a peaceful vigil for Sarah,"" Susanna said.

It comes as:

""That's the absolutely tragic case of a woman who was simply walking home a week ago.

""Women gathered - more than 1,000 of them - to just pay respects, lay flowers and make a point about the fact they don't feel safe.

""The Duchess of Cambridge went a bit earlier in the day and laid daffodils. A spokesperson says she felt for what had happened and remembered what it was like when she was in London before she got married.

""She was an important presence at the vigil.

""But something happened later on which means police are now under fire for a very heavy-handed response.""

She said women who had ""turned up to pay respects to a woman who is dead"" were ""shoved out of the way by police"".

""This is not the image we wanted,"" Susanna said.

""I think women are unsettled, angry and upset.

""This is at a time when rape prosecutions are at a record low, kerb crawling of schoolgirls is still not illegal, a woman is killed every three days, and the new crime bill which comes before Parliament would give a longer sentence in prison for defacing a statue than the starting point for rape.

""There is an issue that needs to be dealt with.""

Earlier on in the show, vigil organiser Anna Birley told presenter Charlotte Hawkins: ""It's incredibly disappointing.""

She said cops had cancelled a planned vigil, which would have had Covid marshals and first aiders on site, as well as a PA system to avoid crowding - and women were instead ""put at risk"".

And Susanna and Ben later spoke to Mr Malthouse - who said both he and Home Secretary Priti Patel are backing Dame Cressida.

Susanna tackled him on the protest - and said: ""This is a serious problem for the Met.""

""I totally recognise the footage from Saturday was alarming and distressing, and it's very sad that an event for people to come and commemorate this extraordinary person who was subject to horrific crime ended that way,"" he replied.

But he argued: ""We've put police in a challenging position for them. We've asked them to do something they've never done before - to stand between us and virus.""

And he said cops would have attended to stand with mourners if they could have done.

""Lots of Met police officers would have been there,"" he said.

""This crime is devastating for them in terms of its implications.""

Asked if Dame Cressida has the ""full confidence of the Home Secretary"", he replied: ""She does, yes, and mine.""

Mr Johnson will today chair a meeting of the Crime and Justice Taskforce to look at ways to make Britain’s streets more safe.

Home Secretary Priti Patel is expected to attend the meeting, along with Dame Cressida Dick and Director of Public Prosecutions Max Hill.

The PM will use the meeting to discuss the Government’s strategy on preventing violence against women, rape prosecutions and the criminal justice system.

Ahead of the meeting, he said: “Like everyone who saw it I was deeply concerned about the footage from Clapham Common on Saturday night.

“I have spoken with the Metropolitan Police Commissioner who has committed to reviewing how this was handled and the Home Secretary has also commissioned HM Inspectorate of Constabulary to conduct a lessons learned review into the policing of the event.”

However, he's now come out in support of Dame Cressida - and told reporters today: ""The police do have a very, very difficult job.

""But there's no question that the scenes that we saw were very distressing and so it is right that Tom Winsor, the inspector of constabulary, should do a full report into it.

""I think people have got to have confidence in the police and Tom's going to look at that.""

New Zealand's deputy prime minister Grant Robertson - who is also the sports minister - blasted the middleweight champ and appeared to call on the UFC to take action.

Adesanya hit out at UFC rival Holland in an Instagram video and said: ""Bro, I will f***ing rape you.""

The sick post has now been deleted by the New Zealander.

But his country's deputy PM was not impressed.

He said: ""There is never a time to make flippant comments about rape. It's just not something anybody should do.

""I’m sure Israel understands that. I believe he has deleted the tweet in question. It will be up to the UFC as to what they do.

“But I would certainly be making clear to him, and to anybody actually, that we have to take rape seriously.

""It's not an issue that anyone should be making jokes or flippant comments about at all.""

Rape Prevention Education executive director Debbi Tohill also told NZ outlet Stuff: ""People with a large social media following can play a significant role in reducing rates of sexual violence and creating healthy cultures of consent for any sexual activity.

""Conversely, these kind of comments where rape is used as a threat create a culture where it is acceptable to make sexualised comments with the potential to cause further harm.

""Sportspeople and celebrities can really influence young people, we would like to see this happen in a positive way, not misused and normalising threats of sexual violence.”

Adesanya did not respond to the comments directly but seemed unfazed by the reaction to his vile words when he simply tweeted a gif alongside the words: ""Incoming clickbait NZ media in 3, 2, 1… This is what it’s all about…CLOUT!!”

This is not the first time Adesanya has received a backlash for making horrendous comments with seemingly little thought.

Last February he predicted then-upcoming opponent Yoel Romero would 'crumble like the twin towers'.

On that occasion, he actually apologised and said: ""You speak on the mic enough times and you are bound to miss the mark with some bars.

""I did on this one and for that I am sorry. I will be more careful in future with my words.”

Adesanya is one of the UFC's biggest stars, who earlier this month attempted to join the elite group of simultaneous two-weight champs.

It comes after a French mum was gang-raped in front of her two young children last week.

The former cricket star said in a TV interview his government had explored the idea of returning public hangings but had been advised against it, the Times reported.

PM Khan said: ""In my opinion, they should be hanged in the marketplace.

""Unfortunately, when we had the discussion, we were told it would not be internationally acceptable.

""The trade status given to us by the European Union will be affected.""

As an alternative to the public hanging, Mr Khan suggested rapists could be chemically or surgically castrated, depending on the severity of their crime.

The 67-year-old ex-sports star said: ""The way there is first-degree, second-degree, third-degree murder, this should be graded in the same way.

""When there is first degree [rape], castrate them. Make them unable to do this.""

HORROR CRIME

The PM's comments were welcomed on social media following last week's attack of a woman in Lahore.

The unnamed victim, believed to be French, was attacked on a motorway after her car ran out of fuel.

The woman was waiting for help when two men smashed in her car windows and dragged her and her kids to a nearby field.

The mum was raped multiple times in front of her children before the attackers ran off with her money and jewellery.

Dodging criticism over last week's attack, Mr Khan told the interviewer that ""our family system is intact"" compared with the breakdown of social values seen in the West.

'RAPE CAPITAL OF THER WORLD'

He claimed the divorce rate in England had surged 70 per cent due to an increase in ""vulgarity"" while Indian cinema had led to Delhi becoming the ""rape capital"" of the world.

However, Mr Khan's words were denounced by human rights activists as the latest example of appealing to public anger.

Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director for Human Rights Watch, said: ""Political leaders engage in a rhetoric of hangings or executions to appease public wrath over state failures, to ensure justice and protection in cases of sexual violence.

""Instead of actually doing the hard work and bringing reform.""

Earlier this year the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs, Ali Muhammad Khan, called for the public hanging of people convicted of the sexual abuse and murder of children.

Jesse Kempson, 28, can now be named after a court order banning his identification was lifted as he lost an appeal against his conviction and sentence over Grace's killing in New Zealand.

10 Jesse Kempson was revealed as the killer who strangled Grace Millane

He strangled the 21 year old in his studio apartment after the pair met on Tinder in December 2018, before burying her body in a shallow grave on the outskirts of Auckland.

It has also been revealed Kempson raped another Brit tourist eight months before killing Grace and had sexually assaulted his girlfriend in a sickening ordeal lasting months.

After his identity was revealed, details of his bizarre lifestyle started to emerge - including claims he was a twisted liar who told women he was a globe-trotting spy.

And during his murder trial, the court was told of a delusional narcissist who had regularly targeted women and girls with his falsehoods.

It was revealed he lied “frequently and repeatedly” to Grace and other women he met online.

In the past he claimed to be dying from cancer, be the cousin of a famous All Black rugby star, have gang connections and posed as a playboy on Tinder.

He even boasted of plans to buy a glamorous restaurant on Auckland's waterfront.

However, time and again, Kempson’s bogus world caught up with him, as he was kicked out of a succession of shared flats and lost jobs as a barman and sales assistant.

His last job - in telephone sales - ended in dismissal on the very day he met Grace after his non-stop lying was exposed.

“Jesse had targets set for him and he met them by writing fake invoices and calling his own phone,” revealed one former colleague.

“He was forever going missing, then trying to claim commission on made up jobs.”

Just weeks before Grace’s murder, the impact he was having on others did appear to dawn on Kempson, and he offered what he said were “sincere apologies” on Facebook.

“I've made a lot of bad decisions in my life so far that I’m not proud of some of which have greatly affected others,"" he wrote.

""My clear arrogance and selfishness has truly affected the relationship I have with people in my personal life.”

He then claimed he had recently been diagnosed with severe anxiety for which he was taking medication.

Kempson added: “Putting all that aside, I’ve just want anyone who I’ve hurt/let down to know I’m truely (sic) sorry from the bottom of my heart.”

At the time, he was living at the CityLife hotel in central Auckland, where he had boasted to his landlord that he was a top manager for Woolworths but, in reality, his rent was paid by state benefits.

The landlord later told reporters he had been on the verge of confronting Kempson when Grace was murdered.

“He appeared to have been a pick-up artist,” he said, “It seems like that was his full time job, like it was all he did.”

Even some of those in Kempson's family branded him a pathetic fantasist.

A stepbrother told New Zealand’s One News he was a “pathological liar” who “lies over pointless things and continues to lie until the point where he's got no out...and then he breaks downs and cries and runs away.""

But his ludicrous lies were far from harmless.

Another trial heard how he subjected a girlfriend to violent assaults, threatened her with a butcher's knife and forced her into humiliating sex acts after telling her he had been sent by the CIA to kill her.

Kempson has also been described as ""creepy"" and obsessed with girls, by one former softball team mate.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia on condition of anonymity, the man said: ""He was creepy towards girls. His life revolved around girls, taking to girls.

""He was always trying to get with younger girls… he was very quiet around the boys.""

It's been reported the killer turned to Tinder and weaved fantastic tales of wealth and success to lure girls to motels or his £190-a-week studio apartment.

Earlier it was revealed Kempson raped another tourist eight months before killing Grace, whose body he buried in a shallow grave.

Just as he did with Grace, he lured the victim, then 21, into a drunken Tinder date before taking her back to his room.

He also sexually assaulted his girlfriend the previous year in a sickening ordeal lasting months.

The shocking details could not previously be revealed because he was on trial for those crimes, with his identity kept secret over fears that linking him with Grace's murder could prejudice jurors.

But both trials - which took place in October and November this year - have concluded with guilty verdicts.

As a result, Kempson has been sentenced to an additional 11 years to run concurrently with the 17-year minimum he was given for Grace's murder.

In a statement, Grace's family said: “As a family we do not think about him or speak his name.""

Backpacker Grace, from Essex, went missing on December 1, 2018 and failed to contact her family on her 22nd birthday the following day while in Auckland, as part of a planned year-long trip abroad.

BODY BURIED IN WOODS

She was last seen alive entering a hotel with Kempson on the evening of December 1.

On December 9, her body was found in a wooded area about 30ft from the side of the road in the Waitakere Ranges near Auckland.

She died after meeting Kempson through the dating app Tinder, going out for drinks, and then returning to his hotel apartment in central Auckland.

He was caged for life with a non-parole period of 17 years for murdering Grace in his Auckland apartment in December, 2018.

Eight months earlier, Jesse Kempson attacked a rape victim, then 21, on a Tinder date.

Furious at her refusal to have sex after he had bought her drinks and dinner Kempson raped her while she lay on the bed.

She kept the 2018 attack secret until she recognised Kempson, now 28, from media coverage the day he was charged with Grace’s murder and went straight to police.

Kempson was convicted of the rape in November.

In a statement read to the court at his sentencing, the victim said for a long time she had woken up “crying and screaming” with flashbacks and nightmares, terrified that Kempson would track her down.

“Every time I went to sleep, I’d see your eyes popping out of your head, staring at me in anger, "" she said.

“I am not scared,” she said. “I am strong. I am not alone. I am loved. I have so much to look forward to in my life and I will not look back. ""You don't have any power over me any more.”

In another trial, Kempson was convicted in October of terrorising his girlfriend over a period of months.

He subjected her to violent assaults, threatened her with a butcher’s knife and forced her into humiliating sex acts after telling her he had been sent by the CIA to kill her.

Details of the cases and their links to Grace's death can only be reported after Kempson failed in a bid to overturn his murder conviction and sentence at New Zealand’s Court of Appeal.

Their ruling on Friday, and a final decision from the Supreme Court today, allowed New Zealand media to finally reveal Kempson’s identity.

Grace's family said not naming Kempson had ""allowed people to remember Grace - a young, vibrant girl who set out to see the world, instead of the man who took her life"".

They told the BBC: ""To use his name shows we care and gives him the notoriety he seeks.

""We instead choose to speak Grace's name.""

'NO REMORSE'

Justice Geoffrey Venning had found Kempson guilty of the rape, prompting an outburst from the dock.

“You have no reason to convict me. You’re full of s**t mate,” raged Kempson, a salesman who had become obsessed with online dating and told women, colleagues and friends a never-ending stream of bizarre lies to boost his ego or attract sympathy.

At his sentencing last month, Justice Venning said it was clear Kempson did not accept his offending and told him: “You have no remorse or insight into it.”

Kempson has now been sentenced to a total of 11 years jail for the two recent trials, to be served concurrently with the 17 year minimum sentence for Grace’s murder, but plans to appeal against both new convictions.

Details of the two new cases and their links to Grace Millane’s death can only be reported now after Kempson failed in a bid to overturn his murder conviction and sentence at New Zealand’s Court of Appeal.

He had taken shocking photographs of her dead body, watched hard core porn and went on another Tinder date before bundling Lincoln University graduate Grace into a suitcase and burying her in a shallow grave in woodland outside Auckland.

At his trial last year, his lawyers argued that Grace whose dad David died of cancer last month, had a long-standing fetish for erotic asphyxiation, had encouraged him to choke her during consensual sex and had died accidentally.

In August, at his appeal hearing, his barrister Rachael Reed admitted his actions after Grace died had been “inexcusable” but said the jury, who took just five hours to deliver a unanimous guilty verdict, had not been directed properly on the consent issue by Judge Simon Moore.","['Jon Lockett', ""Stephen D'Antal""]","THE brute who murdered Brit backpacker Grace Millane was a serial fantasist who pretended he was a CIA spy and dying of cancer to target and rape women.

Mauricio Torres, 50, allegedly sexually abused Isaiah in 2015 as punishment for eating a piece of cake while camping in Missouri.

6 Six-year-old was sexually abused in 2015

His first conviction was overturned and the second ended in mistrial so he now faces a third.

He was initially convicted of capital murder and battery in 2016 but the Arkansas Supreme Court threw out the ruling.

It was argued that rape could not be used as justification for the murder conviction, the MailOnline reports.

Torres was convicted again on the same charges in March 2020 but his stepson, Quinten Martin, tried to attack Torres in the courtroom during sentencing so the judge declared a mistrial.

The state's attorney general's office appealed, claiming the 2020 guilty verdict should stand but that a third jury could decide Torres' punishment.

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

The Arkansas Supreme Court rejected the appeal and ordered a new trial, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports.

Attorney General Leslie Rutledge called the latest ruling ""devastating"".

She said: ""Mauricio Torres has been convicted twice of the brutal murder of his son, but this decision means Isaiah's loved ones and the entire community will have to endure a third devastating trial.

""I will do everything in my power to bring justice for Isaiah.""

Torres' son was assaulted in Missouri and died at an Arkansas hospital a day later.

His attorneys argue that he did not know his actions, which included inserting a stick into his son's rectum, could kill the boy.

Instead, they argue it was intended as punishment for eating a piece of cake without permission during a camping trip.

A medical examiner testified that the boy's death was caused by a bacterial infection resulting from sodomy and chronic child abuse.

She was allegedly raped by one of her cousins while home alone.

He is believed to have told the girl's other two cousins about the abuse before the also went on to sexual assault the young girl, reports The Indian Express reports.

All three of the alleged attackers, all under the age of 18, are believed to have then threatened the girl to keep the horrific attacks a secret.

The abuse was only revealed after the girl developed stomach ache and was taken to hospital by her mum.

Here doctors discovered she was pregnant and transferred her for further treatment on October 7.

Its also thought that one of the group shared the pictures of the girl online.

A police statement read: ""We have registered an offence of rape against the three boys.

""They are absconding and will be arrested soon.""

Repeated demonstration have taken place in India in protests at sexual violence against women.

At least one woman report a rape every 15 minutes on average in the country in 2018, according to official data.

Last month, a 13-year-old girl was set on fire by her boss after he tried to rape her, police say.

The 26-year-old, who is married with a pregnant wife, allegedly carried out the attack in Khammam town in the southern Indian state of Telangana on September 18.

The victim had been hired as a caretaker to look after a bed-ridden man in the house, Gulf News reports.

She was rushed to hospital with burns covering 70 per cent of her body after the assault.

Her condition is thought to be stable.

The two girls, aged 15 and who cannot be named for legal reasons, were targeted by an eight-strong gang who gatecrashed a birthday party at a luxury villa in Italy.

Cops say their drinks were spiked and have described the attack as ''brutal and extreme'' with four men now in custody, three on bail and another being hunted.

Speaking from his lawyer's office in Pisticci, where the attack happened, the 55-year-old dad, described the moment he saw here when he flew to be beside her.

He said: ""She used to have a smile brighter than the stars. Now she no longer has it.''

The man added: ''I was in England, my eldest daughter called me on the telephone to tell me what had happened but she could barely speak.

DAD'S AGONY

''She was saying strange things that I couldn't understand. She was in tears and really upset. I was asking 'what's happened?'

""She just mumbled, she couldn't give me an answer.

''Then my brother answered and he told me what had happened. My whole world fell apart.''

He added: ""My daughter is a strong young girl, energetic and intelligent.

""I really hope that she can recover from this as quickly as possible.''

The girls have told cops they were dragged into bushes during their ordeal which lasted 15 minutes before the men ran off - with one of the girls even biting the private parts of one of the attackers.

CCTV footage released by police shows a group of men running through the garden of the villa with one clearly hobbling.

The arrested men, aged between 19 and 23, were identified after the girls were shown pictures from their social media accounts.

When asked what he thought of the men, the father said: ''They are scumbags, delinquents.

""That's why they should repent as the local bishop said in his Mass the other day. they should be ashamed for what they have done.

""That's the only way they can help their families, justice and in some way end our pain.''

He added: ""My daughter has not left my side or my wife's since we arrived.

""What happened was terrible. The first thing the police said to me was 'Don't worry, you will get justice''.

''I hope I am not left disappointed. For the sake of my daughter I hope there will be an exemplary punishment.''

The four men - pictured by Italian media - are in custody on suspicion of sexual violence and wounding, with a fast-track trial due to take place next week.

Another three men were named as part of the investigation but are not in custody.

They include a pair of YouTube rappers - one the son of a policewoman - who posted a music video with the lyrics ""b****es unbuckle by belt"".

Cops say the gang led the girls to a field where they beat them savagely and took turns to sexually assault them.

Investigators believe he kept her body in his home for four days, before dumping the youngster at a nearby abandoned barn after wrapping her in plastic bags.

The site was previously searched multiple times as police desperately hunted for the 7-year-old with a 200-strong group of officers, as well as the National Guardsman.

Maria disappeared on March 7 - the eve of International Women's Day -and is thought to have been murdered on the same day.

""The abandoned unfinished building was checked more than once. Among the suspects were all residents of the village without exception,"" said the head of the National Police of Ukraine, Igor Klymenko.

""Investigators and operatives interviewed everyone, dozens of people went through a lie detector.

""The man wrapped the corpse in plastic bags, carried it to an abandoned barn, and dropped it there.

""He knew the place had already been searched by police and dog handlers several times,"" he explained.

The seven-year-old's body was found on March 11 during a re-examination of the area.

The callous alleged killer then attended the little girl's funeral alongside her heartbroken loved ones in the village of Shchaslyve in southern Ukraine.

Little Maria was touchingly buried alongside a gift that her father had bought her to commemorate International Women's Day.

Officers arrested Mykola V just one hour later after DNA evidence linking him to the crime was found.

The 62-year-old, believed to be a Russian native, reportedly slashed his wrist when authorities swooped on his apartment.

""The man cut his wrists trying to kill himself and avoid punishment. But we managed to revive him,"" Klymenko continued.

""He will be brought to justice for what he had done.""

According to reports, the sperm found on the victim's body matched the sperm specimen of the alleged killer.

Police official Tetyana Pshon explained: ""Forensic examinations showed the girl was raped and strangled to death with bare hands.""

Local news outlets reported that the monstrous Mykola V was previously convicted of a string of sexual crimes before he was released from prison 15 years ago.

A local resident told Obozrevatel, ""This monster raped a boy with a toilet brush a lot of years ago.

""This boy survived his ordeal but became a disabled person with a mental disorder.

For a black man, racial abuse does more. It stains.

Like other sufferers, I cannot believe Facebook, Instagram, ­Twitter and other social networks are unable to take measures to identify culprits or delete their filth.

Speak up Nick Clegg, a two-faced politician who graduated to many-faced vice-president of global affairs for Facebook.

Neither Clegg nor his employer, Mark Zuckerberg, hold out much hope of netting obscenity before it is published.

And if they act with urgency it will be because, Clegg points out: “Advertisers don’t want their brands and products displayed next to extreme or hateful content — a point that many made explicitly last summer during a high-profile boycott by a number of household-name brands.”

So there we have it. Never mind the targets of racial abuse, vulnerable and very angry, it’s big advertisers like Disney that really matter.

But let’s get back to the former Deputy Prime Minister mentioning a boycott last summer.

It was run by StopHateForProfit for the whole of July and it was estimated it cost Facebook and Instagram, also owned by Zuckerberg, about £23million.

This is a fiddling sum compared with damages of about £500m ordered by an Illinois court for 'photo tagging', a jazzed-up phrase for using facial recognition software.

Thierry Henry has called for social media to do more to stop racists

Even so, such losses are no more than damage on a car bumper to Zuckerberg whose companies earned over £50bn in the last year.

Hate speech is no more than a troublesome ailment to the social networks.

But not to us, and I can only assume that lawyers in many countries are assessing whether damages could be won for victims.

It could be a short-cut to these networks taking significant action.

Black and ethnic minority footballers are easy targets and so far are victims without serious redress.

Football is at the apex of victimisation because it is incomparably popular in this country.

Everybody knows Manchester United and I’d guess a huge number know Marcus Rashford’s name.

He has been racially abused and says: “I’m a black man and I live every day proud I am.”

Thierry Henry takes a different tack. He no longer uses social media.

Arsenal launched a campaign StopOnlineAbuse to add to 'Black Lives Matter' and others aligned with kicking out racism.

Hnery has quit Twitter until it become a 'safer place'

Yet I can’t help thinking they are diffusing the message and prompting insane rage in people of limited conscience.

Henry’s reaction seems the most effective, for the time being. Companies who claim they are doing everything in their power to prevent racist abuse just aren’t.

If Zuckerberg, Clegg and their peers spent as much time and money editing out foul abuse as they do in chasing more users, then the debasing of their output would soon be under control.

Theorists say that improved equality education at school and beyond would eradicate abuse.

Certainly it would help but we all know that murder and rape is wrong and yet human nature has a disturbed side and racial hatred should be added to the list.

Social media action is vital but weeding out culprits, big fines and jail must have a part to play.

https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13812316/child-labour-slavery-weekly-shop-violence-torture/,2021-01-29 11:38:39+00:00,Hidden slavery behind your weekly shop with kids as young as 6 sold for £210 & fishermen murdered by crews,"WITH an aching back, and hunger pangs ripping through his stomach, 15-year-old Abou Traore uses a heavy machete to hack through the dense brush of a cocoa plantation.

The teenager, who has been working long hours on the farm since the age of ten, is one of 16,000 children forced into child labour in West Africa - so that Brits can enjoy their favourite chocolate bars.

17 A nine-year-old child pictured by Unicef working with a machete on a cocoa farm Credit: Mirrorpix

Originally from the impoverished nation of Burkina Faso, Abou was bussed over the border to the cocoa-rich Ivory Coast by human traffickers, leaving his home and parents behind.

“I came here to go to school,” Abou told the Washington Post. “I haven’t been to school for five years now.”

But chocolate is not the only product on our supermarket shelves that rely on slave labour and child exploitation, with almost 25million people trapped in forced labour worldwide, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO).

Around 40 per cent of big businesses in the UK don’t comply with the UK Modern Slavery Act, which obliges chains to tackle slave labour in their supply chains.

In recent years all the major supermarkets, including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons, have signed up to the Ethical Trade Initiative, which aims to clean up the supply chain of products on the shelves, but our weekly shops remain an ethical minefield.

Chloe Cranston, from Anti-Slavery International, said: “Sadly, many of the goods we see on our supermarket shelves will have been made by people in forced labour. That has to stop – and businesses have a big part to play.

""We need to see supermarkets put workers front and centre, from farm workers to those on the shop floor. That includes making sure all workers throughout supply chains are paid the living wage.""

“We need Boris Johnson to get involved too, by bringing in new laws that force businesses to prevent human rights abuses in their supply chains. British consumers deserve to know that they’re not contributing to modern slavery just by doing their weekly shopping.”

To mark anti-slavery month, we look at the potential human rights abuses behind your everyday food buys.

Chocolate

Over two decades ago, the biggest global chocolate companies, including Mars, Nestle and Cadbury, signed up to an agreement to stamp out child labour on the farms that supply their cocoa.

But in October a report by the independent research institution, NORC, at the University of Chicago, found that child labour had INCREASED since then, with more than two-fifths (43 per cent) of all children aged between five and 17 in the cocoa-growing regions of Ghana and the Ivory Coast – the world’s largest producers – taking on work that was dangerous or for which they were too young.

Children as young as six, are forced to spray dangerous pesticides, clear forests using sharp machetes, and carry sacks of cocoa weighing 100lbs or more.

Victims who attempted to sue the chocolate companies, in the US Supreme Court, claim that they were forced to work up to 14 hours a day, fed on meagre scraps of food and were severely beaten or tortured if they tried to escape.

Many of the children are kidnapped and trafficked from neighbouring countries, such as Burkina Faso and Mali, and sold to cocoa farmers for around £210.

Others are controlled by gang leaders or “big bosses” who are paid around £6 a week per child and typically pass on less than half.

The 2019 Washington Post investigation into Mars, the maker of M&M and Milky Ways, found that the company could trace the origin of just 24 per cent of its cocoa, while Nestlé, whose products include Yorkie and Aero, could trace just 49 per cent of its global cocoa supply.

The chocolate companies' response A Mars Wrigley spokesperson said: “We are clear that any exploitation in the cocoa supply chain is totally unacceptable, which is why we are putting cocoa farmers and their communities first with a $1 billion investment in our cocoa supply chain that will help protect children, preserve forests and improve farmer income. They added that they had established ""robust processes to identify instances of child labour"" and said: ""We are focused on our cocoa being 100% responsibly sourced and traceable by 2025.” Cadbury's parent company, Mondelēz International commented: ""At Mondelēz International, we are concerned by the sector’s slow progress towards ending child labour in the West African cocoa supply chain, as outlined in the NORC report. We believe that no amount of child labour in the cocoa supply chain should be acceptable. The company has spent our $400 million on sustainability program Cocoa Life to help reduce child labour but vowed to ""go further."" They also committed to accelerating the roll out of Child Labour Monitoring and Remediation Systems (CLMRS) across West Africa by 2025.""

Nuts and Nutella

Nutella is one of the top-selling spreads in the UK, with over 11 million jars sold each year.

But behind the sweet, gooey favourite is an army of Syrian and Kurdish families, who spend 12 hours a day in backbreaking work on hazelnut farms in Turkey.

Ferrero - who make the spread - buys a third of the country’s hazelnut harvest every year for both Nutella and other brands, including Ferrero Rocher.

Paid less than the minimum wage, many are forced to bring their children to work in order to make enough money to live.

These children work long hours in hazardous conditions, and often miss out on school, according to antislavery.org.

Farmers have accused the company of not paying a fair price for the nuts, leading to low wages for workers - with a family of four earning just £6.50 a week and paying 10 percent to labour agents.

According to a recent report, the company has achieved only 52 per cent traceability.

Ferrero's anti-slavery policy A Ferrero spokesperson: “We do not tolerate child labour and we are determined to prevent and eliminate this issue across our supply chains. “We work with the International Labour Organisation, the Earthworm Foundation and other relevant organisations to drive meaningful change. “Our cocoa beans are 100 per cent traceable to farms so we can identify and address issues in a very targeted manner.""

Coffee

We’re a nation of coffee lovers and whether your preferred caffeine hit is of the instant or coffee shop variety, many top brands - including Nestle and Starbucks - have been linked to slave labour in recent investigations.

A report on child labour and forced labour, published by the Bureau of International Labour Affairs in 2018, found human rights abuses in 17 coffee-growing countries across Africa, South America and Asia.

Coffee producers typically receive between 7 per cent and 10 per cent of the retail price with even the highest paid workers receiving less than 2 per cent.

In Brazil, the world’s largest producer with a third of the market, labourers are often trafficked to work for little or no pay and held in debt bondage.

Many are forced to sleep on rubbish heaps, or in substandard accommodation without mattresses or drinking water, with up to 17 people crammed into a small shack.

17 Dispatches found children as young as eight working eight hours a day Credit: Channel 4

They face long hours, poor safety precautions and constant exposure to fierce sunshine and deadly pesticides.

Many parents take children out of school to help on the plantations and the most recent household survey, in 2015, found that 4,993 children - some as young as seven - worked on coffee plantations.

Last year, a team from Channel 4 filmed children as young as eight, in Guatemala, working eight hours a day, six days a week through the heat of the day – plagued by insects bites, risking deadly snake bites and carrying sacks of up to 100lbs for as little as 31p an hour.

A recent Thomson Reuters investigation found coffee produced by forced labour was stamped 'slavery-free' and sold at a premium to major brands such as Starbucks and Nespresso.

In 2016, Nestlé admitted they bought coffee from two plantations with known forced labour and said they cannot “fully guarantee that it has completely removed forced labour practices or human rights abuses” from their supply chain.

Reacting to the Dispatches programme, Starbucks also said it has a “zero tolerance for child labour anywhere in our supply chain”.

They added that they no longer bought coffee from the identified farms and said the were only using plantations that followed the company's ""ethical sourcing program developed in partnership with Conservation International"" to ensure social, environmental and economic standards, ""including zero tolerance for child labour.”

Nestle's Statement A spokesperson from Nestle said: ""These practices are simply unacceptable and go against everything we stand for. ""We aim to prevent them wherever they occur and are working hard to drive real change in our supply chain."" They also pointed out that in the UK, ""100 per cent of the cocoa we use for our confectionery products is traceable and responsibly sourced. Likewise, 100 per cent of the palm oil we use in the UK is RSPO certified and 94 per cent of green coffee used in our UK products is responsibly sourced and certified."" The company has spent £15million on 'preventative measures' in the Ivory Coast which includes support to almost 90,000 young people, the building or refurbishment of 50 schools.

Avocados

Hailed as a superfood, the popularity of avocados has gone through the roof in recent years.

But the trendy fruit has an unpalatable background of violence, slavery and abuse.

In Mexico - where the market in “green gold” is worth £1.75 - the farms are often owned by drug cartels and have sparked fierce turf wars.

In December 2019, 19 gang members were slaughtered, mutilated and hung from a bridge in Uruapan - by a rival gang bidding for their share of the market.

Campaigners in other South American countries have found low-paid, often migrant workers toiling long hours among polluted water courses and pesticides, fingernails rotting from dipping saplings into chemicals.

Tesco halted the sale of avocados from a Kenyan farm in October, after 79 workers sued Kent-based company Camellia PLC over human rights abuses.

The alleged abuse - carried out by security guards at the plantation - include rape, murder, attacks and false imprisonment at the Kenyan facility.

Tesco's response A Tesco spokesperson said: “We have been working closely with the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), alongside other ETI members, to investigate this issue and ensure measures have been taken to protect workers. “However, in light of additional allegations published, we have suspended all supply whilst we urgently investigate.” Sainsburys and Lidl also suspended sales of fruits sourced from the Kenyan plantation.

Beef products

Exports of beef from Brazil can be found in many British supermarkets, but the cattle farms they come from have been linked to slavery and mass deforestation.

An investigation by the Guardian and Repórter Brasil show that JBS, who supplied major supermarkets including Morrisons and Lidl, exported £2million of beef from a farm which was under investigation for using workers as modern-day slaves.

In a series of raids in June 2016, federal police officers discovered men forced to live in degrading conditions, with no shelter and no toilets or drinking water.

Prosecutors believe the workers were in debt bondage, with payments for food and protective equipment illegally deducted from their wages.

The farm owner, Antônio Filho, had previously been fined £29m for deforesting an area of rainforest the size of central London.

Illegal land seizures, where farmers burn areas of forest for cattle rearing, is often linked to threats and violence against indigenous people.

According to one estimate, there were seven killings, seven attempted murders and 27 death threats against Indigenous people in Brazil’s Amazon region in 2019.

Waitrose removed its own brand corned beef over the row. Morrisons have also stopped buying meat products from JBS.

Bananas

Bananas are a British staple and we are the highest consumer of the fruit in Europe, munching our way through 1.2billion kg a year.

But workers on the plantations - who toil in harsh sun for up to 14 hours a day - earn around 5 per cent of the retail price with shops raking in up to 43 per cent.

Child labour is rife on banana farms in Equador, Belize, Brazil, Nicaragua, and the Philippines with children as young as five working with toxic chemicals.

In Ecuador, a 2002 study by Humans Rights Watch found that “In the course of their work, [child banana workers] were exposed to toxic pesticides, used sharp knives and machetes, hauled heavy loads of bananas, drank unsanitary water, and some were sexually harassed.""

Roughly 90 per cent of the children HRW interviewed reported that they “continued working while toxic fungicides, that cause nausea and dizziness, were sprayed from airplanes flying overhead”.

Banana producers Chiquita pleaded guilty, in 2007, to making large payments to Colombian paramilitary group AUC and were fined £18m. It was also revealed they allowed the group to use their loading bays to import AK-47s.

As a result, family members of thousands of Colombians who were murdered or disappeared launched a lawsuit against Chiquita.

With most supermarkets, including Tesco and Morrisons, importing their own bananas, Chiquita has ceased to be a major player in the UK.

Fyffe's response Fyffes, the UK’s biggest importer, recently committed to stamp out child labour in its supply chain: “Because of the severe negative impact of child labour on children, we do not tolerate the use of child or forced labour, nor exploitation of children in any of our own operations or agricultural supply chains.”

Tuna

The fishing industry in Thailand - worth £4.4billion in exports - employs 800,000 and supplies much of the meat for tinned tuna around the world.

But, despite tougher restrictions introduced in 2015, a recent investigation by the Environmental Justice Foundation found human rights abuses were rife among migrant workers on the boats.

Incredibly, 59 per cent of those interviewed had witnessed the murder of a fellow worker, 68 per cent of had been sexually or physically abused and 44 per cent said they were starved.

Tun Thet Soe, an escaped victim of trafficking told them: “They would torture and murder the fishers then throw them into the sea.

“They abused the crew in many ways – beating, hitting and killing out on the ocean. I witnessed murder with my own eyes.”

Another, Mao Thant Kyaw, said that he was kept in slavery by a debt to his traffickers.

“Whenever I came back to port they told me I owed them 20,000 or 30,000 baht [£400 to £600].

“I couldn't ask why, they would beat me - any one of them would've killed me, so I didn't ask. I've seen beatings and killings before so I didn't dare ask.”

In 2019, the UK-based Business and Human Rights Resource Center (BHRRC) revealed that 80 percent of the world’s biggest canned tuna brands do not know who caught their fish.

Among the big suppliers who did trace to source were Thai Union, who own tuna giant John West.

Palm oil

Palm oil is found in around half the goods on our supermarket shelves – from crisps to margarine, breakfast cereal and tinned goods, plus soaps, toothpaste and shampoos.

But a 2016 report by Amnesty International, found that brands like Magnum, Colgate toothpaste, Dove cosmetics, Knorr soup, Pantene shampoo, Ariel, and Pot Noodle were turning “a blind eye” to child exploitation.

On Indonesian plantations owned by US company Wilmar, children as young as eight were found to be working without safety equipment, exposed to toxic pesticides, carrying heavy sacks of palm fruit weighing up to 25kg, and many have dropped out of school.

A 14-year-old boy, who left school at 12 to help his father, said his younger siblings, aged 10 and 12, also helped.

“I left school to help my father because he couldn’t do the work anymore,"" he said.

""He was sick…I regret leaving school. I would have liked to have gone to school to become smarter. I would like to become a teacher.”

The work is physically demanding, with one 10-year-old telling the charity: “I carry the sack with the loose fruit by myself but can only carry it half full. It is difficult to carry it, it is heavy. I do it in the rain as well but it is difficult…My hands hurt and my body aches.”

Female workers were also exploited, made to work overtime for nothing and threatened with having pay deducted if they did not complete their quota of work.

“It is difficult work because the target is horrifying…My feet hurt, my hands hurt and my back hurts after doing the work,” said one.

Sadly, the picture is repeated in Malaysia, another huge producer of the valuable crop.

How to shop responsibly Shopping responsibly requires research, knowing which companies might be worse performers on human rights. Even then, shoppers should be aware that it is hard to guarantee slavery-free goods, which is why very few companies make this claim. Do your research Check if the company is a Living Wage Employer. Paying a proper wage to cover living costs is a key foundation to preventing exploitation Use labels to guide your shopping like Fairtrade and Ethical Consumer Org’s Best Buy logo. These logos don’t guarantee that a product is slavery-free but these companies pay more attention to possible exploitation. Check if the company has a modern slavery statement, which should be hyperlinked on all UK companies’ homepages. The government is set to launch a search database for statements soon. Check out the Good Shopping Guide See what campaigners are saying: UK organisation Labour behind the Label has loads of information on the UK fashion industry, with petitions to call for brands to act more responsibly.

Nick Kightley, of the Ethical Trade Initiative, called on businesses to take action.

“There are a number of food supply chains where child labour is still widespread, and well documented. Chocolate, coffee, avocados, palm oil, nuts and bananas are known to be particularly high risk.”

""ETI members, as responsible businesses, commit to active human rights due diligence, which means actively looking for labour rights abuses in their supply chains and acting quickly once they are discovered.

""But companies need to do what they can, industry bodies need to take collective action and states need to act to protect people. Only when all three tiers are collaborating together – leaving no gaps such as migrant workers and child labour - will we see real change.

""It is the responsibility of consumers and shareholders to demand that these steps are followed.

""Companies need to overtly work with failing companies to change their practices, or to separate themselves from those failing businesses and make a public stand against them. Alternative, better, corporate strategies for getting food onto our plates – strategies that do no harm – are called for.

""Sadly for now, I see neither of these courses of action being seriously followed. But that has to change.”",['Alison Maloney'],"We believe that no amount of child labour in the cocoa supply chain should be acceptable.

The ten storey block is just yards away from the redeveloped Waterfront area in Ipswich which is known for its bars, restaurants and its marina containing scores of luxury yachts.

Police say the death of the woman is so far unexplained, but it is being treated as suspicious.

Cops are questioning a man aged 55 from Ipswich after he was arrested has arrested on suspicion of murder.

Police were called by the East of England Ambulance Service just before 3.30am today and told that paramedics “were in attendance at a sudden death at a flat”.

A post mortem by a Home Office pathologist is due to beheld to establish how the woman died.

The flats on the upper three floors of Cardinal Lofts were found to be cloaked in potentially dangerous cladding after the Grenfell Tower fire killed 72 people in North, Kensington, London, in 2017.

Residents have been allowed to continue living in the block which was converted into flats in 2004, but there is a requirement for two fire marshals to be on duty 24 hours a day.

Leaseholders have complained about being forced to pay around £5,600 a week to provide the safety fire cover before the installation of an alarm system.

One resident said today: “I didn’t hear anything during the night, but I woke up to see police everywhere. It looks like they are checking the CCTV.”

He also said the rapper - known on Youtube as Red Michael, would never rape anyone and even sometimes babysat his little sister.

The victims, two 15-year-old British schoolgirls, went to a party at a villa in Marconia di Pisticci, in the province of Matera, where they were allegedly raped by eight men the night between September 7 and September 8.

The girls said shortly after they arrived at the party, they were taken to a field nearby, where they were raped for about 15 minutes by a group of men.

Michele Leone and Egidio Andriulli, known on YouTube as Red Michael and Meu Deus, rapped 'b***h, unbuckle my belt' in a music video released weeks before the attack.

Witnesses who were at the party confirmed the rappers were at the villa at the time of the alleged rape.

The two pals were added to the list of suspects after the arrests of Michele Masiello, 23, Alberto Lopatriello, 22, Alessandro Zuccaro, 21, and Giuseppe Gargano, 19, according to Italian newspaper La Repubblica.

Speaking to the Sun Online, the pal who calls himself Broke Boi on Instagram insisted Leone had “nothing to do with it”.

He said: “He left the party before the rape, the media is misleading.”

He also said Red Michael, a trap artist whose latest single, Conto Cash, features a Mercedes with the number plate “2 B*****S” currently has a girlfriend.

Broke Boi said the pair had been friends since school, and although they have lost touch still stayed in contact, adding: “He never did anything like this before.”

He said: “He is a good guy now, [for] real. Since I’m not living in my city I sometimes ask him to look after my younger sister.

“He’s someone I trust and not the type of person that would rape someone, alone or with a group.”

He also confirmed the suspect’s mother is a police officer, adding: “I’m sure he’s not involved”.

The organiser of the party said an invitation was published on Facebook, which is why many people joined in.

He said: ""We were wrong in publishing the invite on Facebook and send it to some WhatsApp groups, but we could not have imagined [what happened].

""The party was going well until at some point I saw the boys from Pisticci arrive.

""Everyone knows them here, they are a bit degenerate, even though some of them come from good families.""

He added: ""When I saw them arrive, I wondered what they were doing here. But then they disappeared.

""When we were serving the cake, the uncle of one of the British girls arrived and started talking.

""It was only then that we understood what had happened.""

One of the victims said she had the impression one of the men was trying to film the attack on his phone.

She said: ""I told them to stop. I was shouting in English let me go.

""They took off their trousers and I tried to defend myself by biting the penis of one.

""I saw that one of them was trying to film it on his phone.''

Following the alleged rape, the victims told the sister of one of them what happened, then they returned home and called the emergency services.

The girls were taken to Madonna della Grazie hospital in Matera for a health assessment, according to reports.

The two victims, who were in a state of shock, reported the incident to police, saying they had been punched before being raped, TGcom24 reports.

Officers described the rape as a ''brutal and extreme assault''.

The investigation revealed that the uncle of one of the girls was told by guests ''don't call the police or you will ruin the party'' when he went to the villa after the attack.

One of the girls described in her statement how she ordered a drink from a barman and was then offered a second by a man she met at the party.

She said: ''I didn't knowingly take any drugs but I think someone put something in my second drink because after I drank it I felt awful.''

FKA Twigs kept things casual while out and about on Wednesday.

She wore a vintage baseball hat, with her blonde hair loose down her back.

The singer kept the brim of the cap down low and had her face covered with a mask.

She kept her personal items safe in a classic black Chanel waist bag that sat on her front.

A houndstooth trench coat was her outerwear of choice for the outing, and she opted for a pair of thick-soled combat boots as her comfortable footwear of the day.

The coat flared open from the winter breeze as she crossed the city streets.

While on the corner, she appeared to tap out some messages on her phone, continuing to do so as she stepped onto the crosswalk.

After taking a couple steps, she continued to hold the phone in her hands but chose to lift her eyes from the screen and keep them more on the road and area around her as she crossed.

In her first television interview since alleging the abuse on Thursday, FKA Twigs spoke with journalist Gayle King on CBS This Morning about the moment Shia, 34, allegedly threatened her life after a fight.

She claimed that around Valentine's Day in 2019, the two took a ""disturbing"" trip to a spa in Palm Springs.

On their return drive to Los Angeles, he was ""speeding down the motorway and saying that if I said I didn't love him and if I was going to leave him, he would smash the car to the side of a wall.""

The singer – whose real name is Tahliah Debrett Barnett – claimed: ""When I thought 'Wow, he needs so much control over me that he would kill us both.'

""Eventually, he pulled over to a gas station and I tried to unload my bags from the car and there were three men opposite the car and I remember thinking 'This is it, I'm done, I can't do this anymore.'

The 33-year-old then claimed that ""he picked [her] up, threw [her] against the car, and started strangling [her].""

""That's when I realized I need help to get out of this relationship,"" she said as she claimed that the three men at the gas station didn't help and simply watched. ""I felt so alone.""

Jessa, 28, and her husband, Ben Seewald, 25, broke their silence after it was revealed that her older brother was being charged with two counts of child pornography.

In their Instagram stories, the couple shared Saturday: ""We are saddened to hear about the charges against Josh.

""As Christians, we stand against any form of pornography or abuse and we desire for the truth to be exposed, whatever that may be.

""Our prayers are with their family as they walk through this difficult time.""

Fans will also know that, back in 2015, Jessa, along with her sister Jill, revealed she was one of the female minors that Josh had molested in the early 2000s.

Jessa joined her sister Jinger in condemning Josh for his actions as the mom of two shared on her Instagram on Friday: ""We are disturbed to hear the charges against Josh.

""While this case must go through the legal system, we want to make it clear that we absolutely condemn any form of child abuse and fully support the authorities and judicial process in their pursuit of justice.""

A source told The Sun exclusively that the couple will attempt to ""distance themselves"" from their brother.

""Jinger and Jeremy have told friends they are disgusted by the charges against Josh.

""They don’t want anything to do with him while this is ongoing and are distancing themselves from it all.

""They’ve been shaken by what is happening, especially Jinger.

“They are in constant touch with family, but their children are their primary focus, and it’s devastating for everyone involved.”

Parents Jim Bob and Michelle also shared a statement on the family website, but they showed support for their son.

The statement read: “We appreciate your continued prayers for our family at this time.

""The accusations brought against Joshua today are very serious. It is our prayer that the truth, no matter what it is, will come to light, and that this will all be resolved in a timely manner.

""We love Josh and Anna and continue to pray for their family.""

On the other hand, their cousin Amy was speechless and revealed her shock to The Sun exclusively.

She said: “At the moment I have no comment to make. I’m kind of speechless, we just hope it’s not true.

“I spoke with several of my cousins after we heard about the arrest. We’re in shock, but we don’t want to think the worst of someone, you want to think the best.

“If it is true it would absolutely devastate a lot of people.”

Amy, who is married to Dillon King, continued: “Everybody that knows Josh would be devastated. Just thinking about it makes me want to have a glass of wine right now.”

She added that her “hugs” go out to Josh’s pregnant wife Anna, 32, and their six children.

The clothing boutique owner ended: “It breaks my heart. Family is family and I wish the best for everyone.”

These statements came just moments after Josh was charged with two counts of child pornography on Friday.

According to the indictment, Josh “knowingly received child pornography” between or about May 14, 2019 and on or about May 16, 2019.

For the second count, Josh “knowingly possessed material that contained images of child pornography,” including “images of minors under the age of 12.”

Josh has been ordered to forfeit all visual images and property, including video equipment, related to the case.

According to a press release from the Department of Justice, Josh “allegedly used the internet to download child sexual abuse material. Duggar allegedly possessed this material, some of which depicts the sexual abuse of children under the age of 12, in May 2019.”

If convicted, he could receive 20 years in prison with fines up to $250,000 on each count.

Josh appeared from jail via zoom for his arraignment on Friday afternoon, as he obtained a lawyer and pleaded not guilty to the charges.

A detention hearing has been set for May 5 at 1:30pm to determine if he could be released on bail, as the government requested he remain behind bars.

If released, the judge said Josh must reside with a third party.

She said at the hearing: ""The court would likely require a third party custodian that he could reside with that would ensure compliance with the conditions of bond.

""It would need to be a residence where there are no minors in the home. You would need to look for somebody who could ensure to the court that there are no minors in the home or would be visiting unsupervised.""

The Sun previously broke Josh was arrested for the federal charges in Washington County at 1:15 pm on Thursday afternoon.

An insider claimed Josh ""turned himself in"" without incident.

The head-turning revelation is related to the 2019 Homeland Security raid on Josh's now-shuttered used car dealership in Springdale, Arkansas, another source told The Sun.

In November 2019, Homeland Security conducted an “ongoing federal investigation” at the lot, but no charges were filed against Josh - until now.

A source exclusively told The Sun of patriarch Jim Bob, 55, his wife Michelle, 54, and their 19 children: ""The family has known that this has been coming for weeks, and Josh has been preparing himself.

""They are praying together for Josh and Anna, who is standing by her husband as she always has.

""Family members are extremely concerned by what is happening and they just want to find out the truth.

""They know that this will put them in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons, and are stunned they are having to go through this again.""

The insider added: ""The family will be speaking out shortly and hope this in many ways will bring them closer together and even closer to God.""

Josh's wife, Anna, 32, announced she is pregnant with the couple's seventh child just last week with a gender reveal video.

The arrest comes six years after In Touch Weekly uncovered a 33-page Arkansas police report claiming Jim Bob confessed to local authorities that his eldest son fondled the breasts and genitals of young girls while they were asleep in the Duggar family home back in 2002.

Following the allegations against him, Josh addressed the claim: ""Twelve years ago, as a young teenager, I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret.

""I hurt others, including my family and close friends.""

Josh was never charged with any crime related to the incidents.

His younger sisters Jill, 29, and Jessa, 28, came forward as two of the victims in an interview with Megyn Kelly, where they insisted they had forgiven Josh for his sins.

More allegations followed for Josh, as another report just three months later claimed the former TLC star was using adultery dating service Ashley Madison.

He said: ""I have been the biggest hypocrite ever. While espousing faith and family values, I have secretly over the last several years been viewing pornography on the Internet and this has become a secret addiction and I became unfaithful to my wife.""

Soon after, porn star Danica Dillon, whose real name is Ashley Johnston, claimed he assaulted her during a sexual encounter.

In a 2020 interview with The Sun, Ashley, 33, described the alleged incident as being so intense ""it felt like this guy tried to kill me.""

Ashley, now a married mom of four, said Josh ""knows what he's done and has to live with his demons.""

The youngster, who was in school uniform, was knifed by teens as he walked to class on the Isle of Dogs in East London.

Witnesses said teachers from nearby George Green's School on Parsonage Street dashed outside to help the lad after the knifing at 8.50am.

And witnesses said it looked like his attackers ""were having fun"" as the horror unfolded.

The boy was taken to a hospital in East London after sustaining multiple stab wounds. He remains in a critical condition.

A 15-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm.

He's been taken to a police station in East London.

Cops are liaising with staff at George Green School, according to the Met Police.

According to residents, brave teachers rushed to the scene and gave the boy CPR after he was repeatedly stabbed near the school gates.

Parsonage Street remains cordoned off by police with a forensic team still conducting a fingertip search.

Retired mechanical engineer Ron Goddard, 60, said: “I looked out the window and saw two boys running away.

""I thought they were having a bit of fun. They looked like they were having fun.

“I didn’t think anything of it until a helicopter landed in the park and the Old Bill came round.

“The boys just ran round the corner. They were about 13-years-old.

“I don’t think they were in school uniform. It was coats and light coloured trousers or jogging bottoms.""

He added: “There’s always been trouble around here. It’s not abnormal.

""The age groups are getting a bit younger, it’s obviously a lack of discipline at school.

“I’m not overly shocked because of the news all the time. It was bound to happen here eventually.”

Another neighbour, who declined to be named, said: “I saw two boys running down the road, but nothing more than that.

“They didn’t look like they were wearing school uniform or anything like that, just casual stuff. They looked young - early to mid teens.

“I didn’t think anything of it until the helicopter touched down in the park - that was a bit of a surprise.

“It’s heartbreaking, but it’s not surprising. You’ve just got to hope the little boy is okay.”

A nearby neighbour to the scene said she had heard from a friend who lives on Parsonage Street that teachers rushed from George Green’s School to aid the boy.

The woman, who declined to be named, said: “I heard from someone on the street that they saw teachers trying to help the kid. One was giving him CPR.

“I think they got some response, but obviously there wasn’t much they could do until paramedics arrived.""

A spokesperson for the school this afternoon confirmed to MyLondon that the victim was a student.

Meanwhile, a schoolbag was also seen by witnesses on the pavement - with forensic officers closely examining the item this morning.

LAWLESS LONDON

An air ambulance landed at nearby Millwall Park supporting ambulance services sent by road.

It comes after a spate of stabbings in London this year.

Junior Jah, 18, was found knifed to death near his home in Canning Town, East London, on Monday afternoon. There is no suggestion that it is linked to today's incident.

Junior was the 12th teenager stabbed to death in London in 2021 - just five less than there were in the whole of 2020.

So far this year there has been 32 murder investigations launched in London, and of those, 25 have been stabbings.

Junior was attacked just minutes away from where Fares Maatou, 14, was stabbed in the head outside a pizza restaurant while defending his friend last week.

Referencing today's incident, a Met Police spokesperson said: ""Police were called by the London Ambulance Service at 8.50am on Thursday, April 29 to reports of a stabbing on Parsonage Street, E14.

""Officers and London’s Air Ambulance attended. A 13-year-old boy was found suffering from stab injuries.

The PM is to set up a “cyber corridor” across the North of England to develop high-tech systems to keep the UK safe.

A far-reaching review will be part of the biggest overhaul of national security in decades.

Experts believe hacking and computer virus attacks have replaced bombs, missiles and poison as the most likely threats to our national security.

They warn Britain risks losing future battles to tech-savvy China and Russia without a shot being fired unless it adapts.

Mr Johnson said: “Cyber power is revolutionising the way we live our lives and fight our wars — just as air power did 100 years ago.

“We need to build up our cyber capability so we can grasp the opportunities it presents while ensuring those who seek to use its powers to attack us and our way of life are thwarted.”

The PM said his thoughts were with the 33-year-old's family and friends this morning after human remains were found last night as part of the investigation.

I am shocked and deeply saddened by the developments in the Sarah Everard investigation. Like the whole country my thoughts are with her family and friends. We must work fast to find all the answers to this horrifying crime. — Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) March 11, 2021

This morning he said: ""I am shocked and deeply saddened by the developments in the Sarah Everard investigation.

""Like the whole country my thoughts are with her family and friends. We must work fast to find all the answers to this horrifying crime.""

And this morning Home Secretary Priti Patel also commented on the case, saying every woman should feel safe to walk home without fear of violence or harassment - and vowing to do more to help protect them.

She said: ""I am deeply saddened by the developments in the Sarah Everard investigation. My heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with Sarah, her family and friends at this unbearable time.

""Many women have shared their stories and concerns online since Sarah’s disappearance last week. These are so powerful because each and every woman can relate. Every woman should feel safe to walk on our streets without fear of harassment or violence.

""At this deeply sad and tragic time as we think and pray for Sarah and her family, I will continue through my role to do all I can to protect women and girls from violence and harassment.""

Sarah vanished last week as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham, South West London - and hasn't been seen since.

She left there around 9pm, phoned her boyfriend on the way, but is believed never to have arrived home.

PC Wayne Couzens, 48, was last night being held on suspicion of her abduction and murder.

The 48-year-old father-of-two is a Met Police armed diplomatic protection officer stationed in Westminster.

The Metropolitan Police last night confirmed human remains have been found in Ashford, Kent, but said they had not yet been identified.

It is 30 miles from the Deal home where Met Police gun cop was arrested on Tuesday night on suspicion of Sarah’s kidnap.

It comes as...

It's not believed the pair knew each other beforehand.

One line of inquiry is that he may have lured Sarah into his vehicle out of view of CCTV cameras.

His work saw him provide protection at major public events attended by senior members of the Royal Family.

""In this early stage we are not able to confirm any identity and that may take us some considerable time.

""The news today that it was Metropolitan Police officer has sent shock waves and anger through he public and through the met.

The 19-year-old girl was convicted of lying in a Cypriot court this week after she retracted her statement about being gang-raped by 12 Israeli men.

6 A language expert says the girl's 'rape confession' appears to have been dictated by a non-English speaker

But she claims she was bullied into removing the allegation by police ten days after the alleged horror attack in July when cops ""threatened"" her.

Now a language expert has revealed the words in the statement appear to have been dictated by a Cypriot police officer.

Dr Andrea Nini told the Daily Mail the girl would need to be a ""criminal mastermind"" to make him believe the language used came from a ""non-native English speaker"".

And the expert, who works with the National Crime Agency, says there was ""very compelling linguistic evidence"" it was dictated by someone who isn't English.

He has pointed to certain sentences that appear to be ""Greek English"" - such as ""the report I did...was not the truth"" and ""I discovered them recording me doing sexual intercourse"".

Five phrases language expert doubts were victim's 'The report I did on the 17th of July' - an English speaker would more likely say the 'report I made' '[The report was] Not the truth' - Dr Nini says the phrase is 'grammatical' but a native speaker would say 'not true' 'Appartment (spelled incorrectly)' - The use of the Americanism is not consistent with the teen's middle-class background and budding university education. She would be more likely to use the word 'flat' 'I discovered them' - Dr Nini says this phrase is 'not consistent' with a native English speaker and more likely to be used by someone who speaks it as a second language 'Doing sexual intercourse' - an English speaker is far more likely to say 'having sexual intercourse'

'RAPE CONFESSION'

There is also a spelling mistake on the word ""apartment"", which Dr Nini says is not consistent with the teen's middle-class background and budding university education.

Dr Nini said: ""Of the two hypotheses; that it was composed by the defendant or that it was dictated by a local police officer, my conclusion from the linguistic evidence is the latter.

""For example, ""doing sexual intercourse"" is not something a native English speaker would say. They would say 'having sexual intercourse'.""

The expert gave evidence during the trial on the girl's behalf but Judge Michalis Papathanasiou rejected her claims that police coerced her into retracting the gang rape allegation.

She is now facing a year in jail amid growing calls in both Cyrpus and the UK to pardon her following the ""unfair"" trial.

ATTACK ALLEGATIONS

The girl, from Derbyshire, insists officers questioned her aggressively for hours then made her sign a retraction that they dictated — without any lawyer present.

Despite concerns about the police investigation, her trial went ahead after months of legal wrangling and delay.

Prosecutors claimed she made up the rape out of revenge after the youths filmed her having sex with one lad and posted it online.

Judge Papathanasiou refused to hear evidence on whether she had been raped - which lawyers say was key to the case.

TEN JUSTICE FAILURES THE POLICE: The 12 Israelis were allowed legal representation from the beginning — but the teenager had no lawyer when questioned nor when she signed a retraction. Her eight-hour police interview was not recorded by detectives.

They want the teenager pardoned.

He also repeatedly berated the teenager, who wore a mask with stitches on the lips, for not showing enough ""respect"" to the court and questioned her claims she was suffering PTSD.

Speaking to The Sun today, the teenager pleaded for the PM’s personal intervention before Tuesday’s sentencing hearing.

As pressure grew on No 10 to act, the teenager said: “Every second of this ordeal has been a waking nightmare.

The girl, who can't be named because she is underage, told the jury in Livingston High Court that Beveridge allegedly flipped her over on a mattress on his bedroom floor and penetrated her, the Mirror reports.

When asked if Beveridge had succeeded, the girl said: ""Not fully. I stopped it. I kicked him in the balls and told him to f*** off.""

The jury heard the 33-year-old allegedly threatened he would rape her friends and sister if she told anyone what had happened.

The now 16-year-old girl claimed that she told Beveridge that she would cut off his manhood to which he responded by going to the bathroom and saying ""sorry"".

Video recordings of the girl's evidence were played to a jury on the second day of Beveridge's trial on Monday.

She told the court how in 2018 she and her pals would skip school every day and go to Beveridge's apartment to smoke cannabis.

“We just got high, like all the time. It was good,"" she said.

After the alleged rape in 2018, the girl claimed that she was sitting on a freezer in the accused's house when he approached her and wrapped her legs around his body.

On other occasions, she told the court how he had groped her over her clothes and that every time she left the flat she would not be allowed to leave without giving him a hug.

Beveridge, 33, has been charged with raping and sexually assaulting two underage schoolgirls.

One of the complainers was 13 and the other 14-years-old at the time it is alleged that he sexually assaulted them at his flat between August and November 2018.

Beveridge is also accused of abducting the 14-year-old, detaining her against her will and assaulting her.

Tim Colt allegedly had sex with three of his daughters - known as Rhonda, Betty, and Martha - and impregnated them, adding more to the notorious barbarous brood from Australia.

The disgusting details of the ""world's most inbred family"" have been revealed after a gag order on the gruesome trial ceased.

The 38-member Colt clan were forced to live in squalor in a sickening story of incest, neglect, and paedophilia that shocked the world.

The children have been given court appointed pseudonyms to conceal their identities.

Three of the late Tim Colt’s daughters have been dragged through court trials, assaulted in prison, and ostracised in communities due to their inbred children – the products of rape and sexual relations with their own father and siblings.

Tim Colt also allegedly parented his daughter Betty's 13 children, four of Rhonda's offspring, and even his granddaughter Raylene's child, Kimberly.

In another Colt trial, Tim Colt's son Roderick was found guilty of raping his niece, who was also his half-sister.

The victim, Petra, was the biological child of Tim Colt and Betty Colt and was also attacked by her uncle Frank in the back seat of his car during a visit to the family farm in February 2010, for which he was convicted.

She told police back in 2013 that she had never gone to school, lived ""in a cult"" and that ""all my aunts, uncles and cousins have all been sleeping together"".

Betty and Rhonda's sister Martha, who openly shared a ""marital bed"" with her brother Charlie Colt, gave birth to five children.

Ther brood were likely fathered by Charlie, her own father Tim and another brother, Roderick, it was revoltingly revealed at her trial.

She was slapped with a two-year prison sentence after concealing the paternity of her kids, who were all proven to be the product of sexual relations with a biological relative by DNA tests.

Martha gave birth to three sons and three daughters, one of whom died, between 1988 and 2006.

She claimed the kids were the product of five casual encounters, a tale a judge called ""demonstrably untrue"".

The court heard how police intercepts of conversations between Martha and brother Charlie were brimming with ""giggling and a degree of sexualised banter.""

Charlie Colt - who originally faced 27 charges – was found not guilty on two charges and acquitted, with the balance being withdrawn.

Tim Colt's other two daughters were also convicted of perjury for attempting to hide the identity of their children's fathers.

Betty was convicted of four counts of perjury, one of lying under oath and one of perverting the course of justice, and jailed for 14 months, which concludes in August.

Rhonda also received a 14-month intensive corrections order for perjury which again ends in August.

DNA testing would reveal all four women had children whose fathers were the mothers’ own father or brother, or a half brother, uncle, nephew or grandfather.

Of the original 80 charges originally levelled against eight Colts – including incest, child sexual abuse, indecency against a child and perjury – many were dropped.

Charlie Colt, who originally faced 27 charges – was found not guilty on two charges and acquitted, with the balance being withdrawn.

Although all eight family members were imprisoned after their 2018 arrest, only half have subsequently received custodial sentences.

Suppression orders had remained on the family’s interbreeding practices and rampant sexual interactions as eight family members were before the courts.

Three family members, Roderick, Martha and Derek Colt, filed notices of intention to appeal in 2020, all of which have since expired.

The horrific family history intertwined with incest only began to emerge nearly nine years ago after authorities discovered nearly 40 relatives living in inhumane conditions in an outback bush camp.

They lived amongst an uninsulated shed, old caravans and tents on a New South Wales bush block that was found in 2012.

The Colt children were sleeping in tents without running water, toilets, or electricity, had shuffling gait, and could not speak intelligible English.

The clan spread to remote parts of Australia after the NSW farm was raided.

Many of them have now reached adulthood and have shown marked improvement in personal hygiene and health - but they are still overshadowed by deprivations from their childhood.

Some have low slung ears or misaligned eyes as a result of inbreeding and they look decades older than their calendar age.

The once close-knit clan have dipped their toe in modern life by joining social media, but appear just as socially isolated as they were under Tim Colt's control.

The Colt family originated in New Zealand with Tim and June Colt marrying in the mid-1960s before emigrating to Australia.

It had been stated in the original 2013 judgment by NSW Children’s Court president Judge Peter Johnstone that the Colts descended from a New Zealand brother and sister.

The couple had seven children - five of whom were Betty, Charlie, Rhonda, Roderick and Martha.

The Colt family travelled around the country performing at town halls, festivals and country shows, and even produced records with album covers featuring the patriarch and three children.

One sickening album was even entitled a collection of family ""love songs"".

However, Cyrell and Ines appear to have moved on - as they sent their love to each other on Instagram.

Sharing a pic of the cast together from the reunion episode, Ines sent several love hearts into the comments.

Cyrell replied: ""I wish we had made up then already lovely. N we still didn't have a pic together at the reunion""

The reality star captioned the post: ""Thank you for the love UK, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and everyone else…. This was filmed over two years ago now…

""This experience taught me so much, the value of words, the value of actions and the value of finding self love… some people will say this experience has taught them about self growth and have changed them for the better.

""I’m proud to say …. I am who I am and proud to be. I didn’t find love on set. But I have found some friends for life. Ps for those asking … My dress is fine! No red stains here""

During the third commitment ceremony in episode 17, Ines' affair to Sam was exposed in front of the whole group.

When Cyrell saw Ines smirking, she flipped out to defend her friend Elizabeth.

Ines stormed out the room and only came back in to explain herself after Cyrell was asked to leave.

Cyrell's other feud with Martha came to a head on the show last week as Martha poured red wine over her head.

Cyrell chased after Martha with her glass of red and soaked the back of Martha's Prada dress as she was held back by her co-stars.

The others were stunned in the aftermath of the violent outburst after Martha got jealous of Cyrell talking to her husband, Michael.

Maria Lozhkareva was brutally killed by convicted sex offender Dmitry Sinitsyn, 45, in the village of Gornyy Borok in Russia.

5 Dmitry Sinitsyn was identified as a suspect through the 'science of smell'

The girl was reported missing by her parents after going for a bike ride and failing to return home in August 2018.

Police and hundreds of volunteers conducted a massive search operation in the area but found no trace of Maria.

However, more than a year later Sinitsyn, who lived in a neighbouring village, was arrested in connection with the teen's disappearance.

Russian cops claim they used ""forensic odorology"" - also known as the science of smell - as dog's discovered his and the girl's scent on a discarded sex toy, according to local media.

Detectives claim they used this to connect the crime to Sinitsyn after the object was found near where Maria had vanished from.

Sinitsyn later confessed to the killing during the investigation.

But when he appeared before a judge, he later said he had been ""forced to make the confession"".

Prosecutors however argued Sinitsyn attacked the girl on a deserted road when she was riding past him on her bicycle.

He dragged the teenager in the woods, committed acts of sexual nature against her and strangled her, investigators said.

Detectives said the vile Sinitsyn then threw the victim's bicycle in a swamp and hid her body - which has still not been found.

The man “refused to show where he hid the schoolgirl’s body”, according to the court’s records.

A law enforcement official said to local media: “The court has decided that the evidence found by the investigation proves the defendant’s guilt.

“His involvement in the commission of the crime is confirmed by expert opinions, information about telephone connections, testimonies of witnesses, specialists and experts, protocols of examinations and searches, as well as other materials of the case.”

Yesterday, the Nizhny Novgorod region court charged Dmitry Sinitsyn with murder of a minor and sentenced him to 19 years in prison.

The full-time influencer was riding in the back seat of a car and panned the up to her face where she looked sombrely towards the camera.

Ines revealed to The Sun she has undergone a series of cosmetic procedures and is hoping to next have a nose job.

Since filming in 2019, she has had lip filler, Botox and transformed her smile with expensive 'Picasso' porcelain veneers on both her upper and lower teeth.

Ines told The Sun: “When the dentist redid my mouth it changed the alignment and it was sort of like having a jaw reconstruction too. I also get Botox in masseter muscles, that’s why my face now looks a lot different.”

Injecting Botox into the masseter muscle reduces its size and is done to achieve facial slimming.

Alice Bender, 22, from Arizona, US, documents her child-rearing methods on TikTok.

Criticising the full-time mum, some people argued that chewing on such things is ""unsanitary"", but Alice says she ""does not fear bacteria"" and actually ""welcomes it.""

Alice also follows a vegan diet and she is raising her son Fern as naturally as possible - with a strictly vegan diet and no sleep schedule.

She shared videos of Fern sucking on rocks and even shopping trolley handles, which left some people asking why.

“I do not fear bacteria,"" she said. “In fact, I welcome it.

4 Alice lets her son Fern eat dirt, sticks, rocks and sand

“I trust nature and I trust my baby.

“It is not a coincidence babies have this instinct when they are breastfeeding.”

From around three months of age tots often use their mouth to explore the world - this is known as “baby mouthing,” according to Healthline.

As a result, many parents are constantly moving things out of the way and out of reach of curious babies so they don't put it in their mouth.

But some parents, including Alice, believe ""baby mouthing"" helps kids to develop a robust immune system.

4 She said bacteria will help build him a strong immune system

Alice also referred to the “allopathic industry” in the clip, saying it's ""taken the world by storm.""

“This did not happen by accident, it happened after a series of billion-dollar campaigns intended to shift the public’s perspective on health,” she said.

Allopathy refers to science-based, conventional medicine rather than alternative medicine or homeopathy, with allopathy using drugs or surgery to treat disease.

Alice's video has been viewed more than 12 million times and has sparked a a roaring debate in the comments.

While many disagreed with Alice's views, some actually agreed.

One wrote: “I get where you’re coming from, but also parasites, flesh-eating bacteria, meningitis, measles etc…”

""It’s one thing letting your child eat food off the ground, but you’re taking it too far,” added another.

One said: “I find it so weird when people shield their kids from everything.”

And another noted: “Your baby is going to have an amazing immune system.”

Alice started her TikTok page @comingupfern just before her son was born, to bring attention to her unconventional parenting views.

She now has 281,000 followers and her individual videos get up to 7.7 million views.

She previously told Fabulous: ""I ended up meeting lots of moms on there who encouraged me to speak out about my views, and I realised not many people had heard of attachment parenting.

The paedophiles are just the latest to undergo the procedure, which one man has said left him “aching so badly” he could hardly walk.

12 The injection reduces the male libido

Across this year, that number increases to 95 in the ex-Soviet state, at a cost of £178 per paedophile, according to the Health Ministry.

The tough new laws came into force in 2018, allowing them to inject chemicals to lower the sex drives of offenders caged for raping or sexually assaulting kids.

Yerkinbek Alimebdov, 41, who sexually attacked two school girls, became the first to be sentenced to chemical castration under the new regime in 2019.

Since its introduction, one child rapist, after undergoing the first injection to reduce his libido, said: “It is incredibly difficult, I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.”

He called for a ban on the “barbaric” procedure.

However, the Kazakh government believe that the use of forced chemical castration among convicted paedopohiles will ultimately slash sex crimes against minors.

Interior Ministry official, Alexey Milyuk, said that, since the law came into effect, “the number of offences against the underaged had decreased by 15.4 per cent.”

He added that the new ""significantly tightened legislation"" has allowed jail terms of rape and sexual assault against children to be increased from 12 years to life.

Kazakhstan now also jails all paedophiles in maximum security prisons.

Paige, 22, has previously claimed the disgraced actor wanted to remove her bottom ribs so he could eat them and that he carved the letter ""A"" into her pubic bone.

The college student talked about his mother in a clip from her upcoming appearance on The Dr. Oz Show on Friday, which was obtained by Page Six.

Dr Mehmet Oz asked her if Armie's mom or other ""members of the family heard things about him.""

She responded: “Well, she never specifically said anything to me because I don’t think she wanted to assume.""

Paige added: ""But she literally just said things like, ‘he has demonic behaviors, the devil was trying to take him,’ things like that.

""I didn’t grow up extremely religious, so that was a little bit out of touch for me, but I did get a feeling from her like she knew that he had a very, very dark side.”

The Sun has contacted Armie's rep for comment.

Last July, Armie reportedly tweeted that he woke up in the early hours of the morning to Dru Ann ""pouring oil on my head and praying very loudly in tongues while standing over my bed so she could get the ‘demons out’ of me.""

12 Armie has been accused of sending graphic messages about cannibalism, having 'slaves' and rape fantasies

12 Some of his alleged messages were previously leaked

12 'I own you,' one of Armie's alleged messages read

Dru Ann is a personal trainer from Tulsa who met Armie's father, Michael, on a flight in 1985, according to a Washington Post feature from 1996.

Michael reportedly converted to Christianity and they married five months later in an alcohol-free wedding at a Methodist church.

Last month, Paige alleged that Armie was ""100 percent"" serious about finding a doctor to remove her bottom ribs.

""He was telling me you can remove the bottom ribs so he could smoke them, cook them and eat them. He kept saying, 'You don't need them,'"" she told Star Magazine.

The model said she laughed it off but felt ""anxious and confused"" as a result of his alleged behavior.

She also claimed Armie carved his initial above her pubic bone in an ""extremely painful"" act and later bragged about it to his friends.

Armie first came under fire last month for allegedly sending disturbing messages to multiple women about cannibalism, rape fantasies, having ""slaves"" and ""drinking blood.""

Armie's ex Courtney Vucekovich told the Daily Mail that he wanted to break her rib and eat it.

The app founder said: “He was really into saying he wants to break one of your ribs and eat it. Like barbecue it and eat it.

“In terms of the BDSM stuff, he made that pretty clear that it is something he is interested in very early on in the relationship and he referenced breaking my ribs often.”

Courtney alleged that she felt as if she had been groomed by the actor and needed to undertake a 30-day intensive course of therapy for trauma and PTSD to deal with the repercussions after their breakup in early October.

The anonymous Instagram account, House Of Effie, kickstarted the claims about Armie's disturbing alleged fantasies and behavior.

She claimed they had an affair from 2016 until 2020, while he was still married to Elizabeth Chambers, whom he has two children with.

House Of Effie has shared numerous graphic screenshots and photos reportedly sent from The Social Network star.

One of his alleged messages reads: ""I am 100 percent a cannibal. I want to eat you.""

Another read: ""You just live to obey and be my slave. If I wanted to cut off one of your toes and keep it with me in my pocket so I always had a piece of you in my possession?""

Since the scandal, videos from Armie's private Instagram account have been leaked showing a lingerie-clad woman reportedly waiting on his bed as well him ""bragging about drug use.""

After the scandal broke, Armie was dropped by his talent agency, WWE.

He has also bowed out of The Offer, a series centered around the making of The Godfather and was replaced by Josh Duhamel in Jennifer Lopez's upcoming romcom, Shotgun Wedding.

She was gang-raped before being hurled to her death in Mogadishu, Somalia, according to police.

Eleven 11 people have been arrested over the sickening attack last Friday.

Police said in a statement: ""We have arrested 11 people over the recent rape case in Wabari neighbourhood in Mogadishu and efforts to track and identify other suspects are ongoing"".

Hamdi had completed high school and was going to enrol in college later next year, according to All Africa.

Her murder has caused fury in a country where many crimes go unnoticed.

Angry protests have also broken out over her killing, with many demanding an end to the culture of violence against women in the country.

Several influential people in Somalia have condemned the crime and called for justice to be served.

Mustaf Sheikh Ali Duhulow, an MP said: ""The rape and killing of Hamdi sent shockwaves across Somalia, and no stone will be left unturned to ensure justice is served"".

Another MP, Hassan Moalim, promised he will make sure her killers face justice.

It's alleged that the youngster was sexually assaulted inside a council dumpster in Bhopal's Ayodhya Nagar area on Saturday afternoon, reports Times of India.

While supported by her granny, the girl told cops at Ayodhya Nagar Police Station that the alleged rapist had given her 5p, while ordering her against telling anyone.

Police heard that she had been playing near her home when a pal of the alleged rapist walked up to her at about 1.30pm.

He handed her a 100-rupee (£1) note, and asked her to buy a tobacco pouch from a shop, said Sub-inspector Nisha Ahirwar.

The cop added: ""She bought the tobacco, but when she went to give it to him, he told her to give it to another man standing next to a [dumpster] a few metres away.""

She was then dragged into the huge container and allegedly assaulted, SI Ahirwar added.

The girl told cops she'd seen her alleged attacker in the neighbourhood several times before the alleged rape.

Eight investigation teams were sent out to hunt down the alleged offender, with cops taking photos of 40 potential suspects.

As a result, Ravi, 30, was nabbed at a liquor store on Saturday night, and taken into custody after the girl pointed out his pic.

Ravi - whose surname hasn't been publicly released - has been charged with rape and criminal intimidation.

It's the latest in a horrific string of assaults against children in India, where an epidemic of child rape continues to sweep the country.

India's rape crisis saw one woman being sexually attacked every 15 minutes on average in 2018, government data shows.

In 2019, a woman, 23, was set on fire by a gang of men in Uttar Pradesh as she travelled to court to press rape charges.

The National Family Health Survey, conducted in 2015-16, revealed that 33 per cent of married women aged from 15-49 age experienced physical, sexual, or emotional spousal violence.

But, of these victims, only 14 per cent sought help and 77 per cent never spoke about it.

Nearly 34,000 rapes are reported in the country annually despite tough laws introduced in recent years.

Goo Hara, 28, died in November, six months after an earlier suicide bid.

In October, K-Pop superstar Sulli, 25, took her own life after years of online abuse.

She was good friends with Jonghyun, 27, a singer with mega-band SHINee, who took his life in December 2017.

The woman - who sent the video to London mayor Sadiq Khan and the Met Police - posted it alongside the caption: ""On the day of the Sarah Everard vigil, this just happened.

""For those who doubt it, it’s a daily occurrence.

""I was just walking home too.""

It comes as:

The 18-second clip begins with her telling the man: ""You're following me down the street.""

The man, who is dressed in a hoodie and red trainers, replies: ""Don't take a snap of me - take a snap with me.""

She replies: ""Go away.

""Let me go on my walk.""

As she walks away, the man can be heard saying ""I'm going to take a snap"" before she replies: ""No you're not going to snap a photo of me.

""Leave me alone.

""Stop following me.""

As she crosses a road, the man appears to briefly follow her before riding off and shouting insults back at her.

The clip has been shared hundreds of time on social media, with many sending messages of support.

One said: ""Sorry this happened to you Simmy.

""Men, if you find yourself walking behind a lone woman, give her plenty of space, maybe cross to the other side of the street if you can, and pass her as quickly as you can without giving her any (more) cause for anxiety.

""Be aware.""

But others turned on Simmy - and one said: ""Zero context whatsoever. The beginning of the video YOU are walking past HIM.""

But the vigil descended into chaos as police moved in - with women dragged from a bandstand, pinned to the ground and cuffed as they mourned.

This morning, she told Good Morning Britain: ""I was terrified.

""I've never been so scared.""

Met Commissioner Cressida Dick is facing mounting calls to resign.

But she's refused - and says Sarah's death has made her ""more determined"" to lead the force.

And Boris Johnson has now backed her to stay in the role after crunch talks this weekend.

The PM will chair a meeting of the Government's Crime and Justice Taskforce today to discuss ways to protect women and girls from violence, with Dame Cressida among the attendees.

Speaking ahead of the meeting, Mr Johnson was asked if he still had confidence in the police chief.

He replied: ""Yes I do. And what she's asked is... that we look at what happened on Saturday night.

Kadian Nelson, 27, was assaulted after admitting to kidnap, rape and making a threat to kill this week.

Kadian Nelson, 27, this week admitted kidnap, rape and making a threat to kill at Kingston Crown Court

Nelson was attacked in prison after admitting his crimes

As prison officers checked him into Wandsworth prison, South London, a fellow con attacked him.

Nelson, who will be sentenced in August, was rushed for treatment after being battered.

He had earlier admitted kidnap, rape and making a threat to kill against the girl, who had been walking to school in Mitcham in November last year.

The court heard he followed the schoolgirl before creeping up behind her and putting one hand over her mouth and another on her head.

He then threatened to kill her and forced her to walk towards an alleyway.

The girl had been on the phone chatting to a friend about their homework when she was attacked just after 7am.

Nelson told her to take off her coat and school blazer before raping her. He then put his own jacket on the victim.

Police were alerted when a woman called 999 stating that her daughter had seen a man grab a young girl.

DEPRAVED CRIMES

A family member of the woman then went out to check what had happened and managed to interrupt Nelson.

When she questioned him he told her that the victim was his sister.

The victim then managed to signal that she needed help before police arrived and Nelson fled, leaving the victim wearing his jacket.

At the time of the attack Scotland Yard were forced to warn people not to “take the law into their own hands” after the case gained traction on social media.

Crowds of locals visited various addresses and police said “emotions are running high”.

The Met issued an emergency Section 60 dispersal order – giving officers the power to search anyone and instruct them to leave the area.

Expressing their relief that she is finally home, they said she had been suicidal in the past.

She was forced to spend nearly five weeks in prison on remand in a cell with up to nine other women.

Even after she was granted bail in August, she was kept under virtual house arrest in a villa in the holiday resort of Ayia Napa and had her passport seized.

Her lawyer said her ""mental health has severely deteriorated"" and she now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.

Her grandmother told The Telegraph: ""We didn't want her going back to prison.

""She had been suicidal and if she had been jailed she would have tried to kill herself and the judge knew that too.

""I'm sure that is why he gave her a suspended sentence - the country wouldn't want that.""

'A NIGHTMARE'

After her trial ended on Monday, she told The Sun how she was desperate to enjoy England’s “cold weather”, tuck into a “cheeky Nando’s” and go for walks with her pet dog again.

Still insisting her innocence, she vowed: “My fight goes on.""

She added: “It’s been a nightmare for me, mum and everyone. Now I just want to be with my friends and family.

“What kept me going was my family and the amazing support of my friends and all other people who got in contact to say they believed me.

“Now, at last, I can go home to my own bed. I’m even looking forward to the cold weather back in England!

“I can’t wait to have a cheeky Nando’s and to take my dog for a long walk through the countryside.”

Her lawyers have already begun work on an appeal. Judge Michalis Papathanasiou suspended her jail term for three years, and ordered her to pay £125 court fees.

He told her he was giving her a “second chance” after last week convicting her despite huge holes in the prosecution’s case.

'JUDGE WAS MYSOGYNISTIC'

The judge sparked fury by insisting “all the evidence shows that she had lied”. He dismissed expert defence witnesses as “unreliable” while ruling all prosecution ones “credible”.

Prosecutors also tried to pass off injuries to the woman — said to have been caused when she was held down by her attackers — as “jellyfish stings”.

She told The Sun: “I felt the judge was very aggressive towards me and vindictive. He was misogynistic towards me and my female defence team. They were barely allowed to ask questions and yet the prosecutor had me on the stand for six hours.”

Well-wishers chanted outside the court yesterday and held signs saying, “We Believe You”.

8 Patsy, giving her first television interview this morning, says she's 'never been more scared'

Shocking scenes at the Clapham Common gathering saw women dragged from a bandstand as they mourned tragic Sarah, 33.

And in her first TV interview on today's Good Morning Britain, Patsy told hosts Susanna Reid and Ben Shephard: ""I've never been so scared.""

It comes as:

Student Patsy said: ""To be honest, I still don't know why I was pushed to ground so forcefully.

""I'm quite small, and it was two very large male officers who pulled me back quickly and I hit the ground.

""From start to finish it was a whirlwind. It happened very quickly - I was only there to lay candle down. I didn't expect that to happen.""

She said police surged onto the bandstand as night fell.

""They were saying things making people angry. I think women have stood by and let things happen for long enough,"" she said.

""As I was up against bandstand, I could see women standing next to me - police were trying to get around her neck, and someone else was being pulled back.

""We were terrified.""

8 Patsy grew tearful as she spoke to the hosts about Sarah's death

She said she'd attended the vigil simply to lay a candle for Sarah - after rumours spread online that was was a hired actor.

""I'm not hired by anyone, I just wanted to put a candle down,"" she said.

""I was terrified.

""I've never been so scared.""

Patsy says she was freed just 20 minutes after being taken into custody and ordered to pay a £200 fine.

Susanna told her: ""That is absolutely not what should have happened.

""None of the women there should have said it turned scary.

""That's absolutely counter to what police would want and what the women would want.""

Former Met Assistant Commissioner Helen King also appeared on the show.

She said: ""I think everyone was really saddened.

""What that day was all about was remembering Sarah and focusing on impact threat of violence has on all women.""

But she defended police's actions - and said: ""My reading would be that as that crowd became more and more packed around bandstand, people were standing together and chanting, which spreads droplets.

""They're all public health and safety concerns and that meant police wanted to disperse the crowd.""

Earlier today, Susanna gave a passionate speech about the vigil - and said women are ""angry"".

""This was supposed to be a peaceful vigil for Sarah,"" she said.

""But something happened later on which means police are now under fire for a very heavy-handed response.""

She said women who had ""turned up to pay respects to a woman who is dead"" were ""shoved out of the way by police"".

""This is not the image we wanted,"" Susanna said.

Minister stands by embattled Met Commissioner Policing Minister Kit Malthouse says both he and Home Secretary Priti Patel are backing Met boss Dame Cressida Dick. Susanna Reid tackled him on the scenes at Clapham Common in an interview this morning - and told him: ""This is a serious problem for the Met."" ""I totally recognise the footage from Saturday was alarming and distressing, and it's very sad that an event for people to come and commemorate this extraordinary person who was subject to horrific crime ended that way,"" he said. However, Mr Malthouse argued: ""We've put police in a challenging position for them. We've asked them to do something they've never done before - to stand between us and virus."" And he said cops would have attended to stand with mourners if they could have done. ""Lots of Met police officers would have been there,"" he said. ""This crime is devastating for them in terms of its implications."" Asked if Dame Cressida has the ""full confidence of the Home Secretary"", he replied: ""She does, yes, and mine.""

""I think women are unsettled, angry and upset.

""This is at a time when rape prosecutions are at a record low, kerb crawling of schoolgirls is still not illegal, a woman is killed every three days, and the new crime bill which comes before Parliament would give a longer sentence in prison for defacing a statue than the starting point for rape.

Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick is facing growing calls to resign over the police's reaction to the vigil.

But she's refused - and says Sarah's death has made her ""more determined"" to lead the force.

In the second part of a CBS Evening News interview, that will air tonight, Bennett, 25, told anchor Norah O'Donnell about being ""terrified"" after reporting the claims.

Bennet has alleged that Cuomo sexually propositioned her, telling her he was ""lonely"" and he wanted a girlfriend and was willing to sleep with a younger woman.

Shortly after this, she said she reported the encounter to senior officials, saying the governor had ""crossed the line"".

But she said she was ""terrified"" and did not pushing for an investigation and was happy to be transferred to a different role.

Yet soon after, she was called in for another meeting, this time with the governor’s chief of staff and general counsel.

Bennett said: ""At first they apologized and said it was inappropriate.

'IT WAS JUST GROOMING'

""When I asked them if they could let it go, saying I don’t want this to be investigated, please drop this — because I was scared — she said ‘you came to us before anything serious happened, it was just grooming and it was not yet considered sexual harassment...So for that, we do not need to investigate’.""

But Bennett’s lawyer Debra Katz said: ""When she said 'I am terrified I don’t want you to investigate', what they should have said was 'we have a legal duty to investigate'.""

Meanwhile, Beth Garvey, Cuomo’s special counsel and senior adviser, told CBS: ""We continue to believe the matter was handled appropriately and look forward to cooperating fully with the Attorney General’s review.""

In the first part of the interview, which aired on Thursday, Bennett said: ""He is a textbook abuser.

""He lets his temper and his anger rule the office, but he was very sweet to me for a year in the hopes that maybe one day, when he came onto me, I would think we were friends or that it was appropriate or that it was okay.""

Bennett has accused Cuomo of sexual harassment claiming he quizzed her about her sex life after she went to him for help as a survivor of sexual assault.

Her claims came three days after Lindsey Boylan, a former aide to the governor, claimed Cuomo kissed her on the lips and suggested they play strip poker.

On Friday morning, Boylan called on ""bystanders"" to activate and ""say something"" regarding the allegations.

10 Bennett used to work for the governor Credit: Twitter

""I went to bed & woke up thinking about all the bystanders that make abuse possible,"" Boylan tweeted. ""They watch it happen. They look away. They validate the abuser with support.""

""We cannot change the past but we can heal & create a better future,"" she continued. ""There are no bystanders in that better future.""

She then called on the ""bystanders"" directly, saying: ""Bystanders: you can be activated. You can do better. You can help make it right and end the abuse. End the abuse now. Say something. Do something.""

After the two accusations, a third woman, Anna Ruch, came forward and told The New York Times that Cuomo touched her lower back, then grabbed her cheeks and asked to kiss her at a September 2019 wedding.

Meanwhile, Cuomo has apologized for the claims of sexual harassment but insisted he will not resign as he ""never touched anyone inappropriately.""

""I now understand that I acted in a way that made people feel uncomfortable,"" Cuomo said.

""It was unintentional and I truly and deeply apologize for it. I feel awful about it and frankly I am embarrassed by it,"" he added.

During the Thursday night interview, Bennett claimed that Cuomo felt ""untouchable"" and seemed fixated on her rape trauma as he propositioned her for ""sex.""

10 Lindsey Boylan has also made allegations against the governor

Anchor O'Donnell asked Bennett if she thought Cuomo was ""emboldened"" by ""national attention"" on his coronavirus briefings.

“Absolutely,"" Bennett replied. ""I think he felt like he was untouchable in a lot of ways.""

Bennett also recalled that, in a May 15 conversation, he seemed focused on the fact that she survived sexual assault.

“So he goes, ‘You were raped. You were raped. You were raped and abused and assaulted,'” Bennett said.

O'Donnell asked Bennett if she believes Cuomo was propositioning her.

""Yes,"" Bennett said.

""For what?"" O'Donnell asked.

""Sex,"" the former aide said.

The anchor also asked Bennett what she was thinking when Cuomo asked her about her sex life in June, to which she responded, ""I thought, he's trying to sleep with me.""

“The governor’s trying to sleep with me and I’m deeply uncomfortable and I have to get out of this room as soon as possible,” Bennett said.

O'Donnell asked Bennett to elaborate.

“Without explicitly saying it, he, he implied to me that I was old enough for him and he was lonely,” she said.

Bennett said she now believes that ""Governor Cuomo groomed her.""

When asked what Bennett wants to happen to the governor, O'Donnell said: ""Charlotte Bennett worked with Governor Cuomo for several years – she wants the truth to come out.

""She has spoken to other women who worked for Governor Cuomo who had similar experiences.

""She reported the behavior to Governor Cuomo's chief of staff, she describes those conversations with them and then what happened after she reported the alleged harassment.

""She is speaking out and describing those experiences in hopes of bringing about some change.""

The former aide also told the anchor that she was ""tasked"" with finding Cuomo a girlfriend.

She claims she was called into the governors office on June 6, one day after she claims that he made it clear he wanted to ""sleep with"" her.

DI Arnott, DI Kate Fleming, SI Ted Hastings and the rest of the AC-12 team will be back to their old tricks, trying to suss out the corrupt officers within the police force.

The team will be involved in their ""highest profile"" investigation yet, as they try to detect whether police corruption contributed to the unsolved murder they're looking in to.

And this is all whilst trying to figure out who 'H' is.

Arnott, Fleming and Hastings will be helped by a couple of new faces - including Detective Chief Inspector Joanne Davidson and DC Chloe Bishop.

But will the new DCI in town be someone the team should be suspicious of?

In one part of the new teaser an officer says to another colleague on the phone: ""You have no idea what she's capable of,"" as the camera pans back on Joanne Davidson.

With a bunch of nail biting scenes in the new season - including car chases, crashes, gun showdowns and unsolved murders - fans can definitely expect to be sitting on the edge of their seats for the whole duration.

Over the past nine years, fans of the hit show can been pondering over who 'H' could be - and the trailer has hinted that it could be a woman within the force.

She is said to have been approached by the man, who had parked up in a white transit van, as she walked along a quiet path in the village of Nonington, Kent, two weeks ago.

He offered the woman a cigarette and seemed “aggressive and suspicious” - but he fled after she shouted for help.

Julia James, 53, was discovered dead along a bridle path in neighbouring Snowdown on Tuesday afternoon.

Officers investigating her death have been made aware of the previous incident in Nonington.

A friend of the woman has now revealed her trauma at the experience - and said she fears he could strike again.

What we know so far:

She said: “She’s been left traumatised by the experience and hasn’t really left the house since it happened.

“It’s horrific. Her husband now has to take the dog for a walk because she’s terrified he will come back.

""It happened just two weeks ago barely a mile from where Julia was killed.

""There are clear similarities with this case and that of Julia’s in that both women were out alone in a remote country spot walking their dog.

""There is a murderer on the loose and a lot of people are scared.""

A spokesman for Kent Police said: ""This is a live investigation and we continue to carry out enquiries to establish the circumstances.

""We will not be commenting or speculating on any individual lines of enquiry at this time.""

It comes after police today revealed Julia was bludgeoned to death.

Her killer remains at large with police keeping an ""open mind"" over why the mum-of-two was murdered.

Officer say they can't rule anything out at this stage - including whether there was a sexual motive behind the brutal killing.

Kent Police Deputy Chief Constable Tim Smith told BBC Radio Kent: ""We are working very hard to identify a motive and we are working very hard to identify who may have committed this.

""We don't have any clear suspects at this time but we are working very hard to identify that.""

DCC Smith added: ""We are keeping a very open mind about the motive and until we can follow those different lines of inquiry which will help us to get close to the truth we may be able to confirm different parts.

""But at the moment the investigation team need to keep an open mind about why this has happened and who has committed this awful crime.""

DCC Smith said he could not rule out if Julia, who worked for the police for 15 years, was attacked by a stranger.

He also said hundreds of officers were working on the investigation and following up a number of lines of inquiry.

Kent Police assistant chief constable Tom Richards issued a chilling warning to women and children urging them to be aware of their surroundings.

In a press conference today, he reiterated police have no clear motive or suspect for Julia's killing.

He said the force can't rule out if her killer was someone she came across in her work, a potential dog-napper or if there was a sexual motive.

Julia was not on duty at the time of her death or wearing uniform and had just popped out to walk the dog after working from home during the day.

And ACC Richards said all of her possessions were still with her body - with Jack Russell Toby unharmed.

He confirmed ""devoted"" and ""passionate"" Julia suffered from a blunt force trauma to the head but would not comment on a potential murder weapon.

The cop said: ""We do not at this stage have any identified suspects, we are keeping all options open to us while we fully investigate the circumstances of this matter and try to understand fully what happened.

""We do not at this stage understand the motive.""

18 ACC Tom Richards said there is no clear motive for Julia's killing

He stressed Julia's death is being treated as an ""isolated incident"" that is not being linked to any other offences.

And he urged anyone who saw anything suspicious on Tuesday or Wednesday to come forward.

The officer also told locals to ""be cautious"" and stay aware of their surroundings as they hunt the murderer.

PCSOs patrolling the village, near Canterbury, have now told not to “veer from your normal route” when walking home.

Women living in the area say they are now scared to go out alone in the wake of Julia's murder.

One female neighbour said: “We’re all terrified. There’s a lot of dog walkers in the area.

“It’s horrific. We’re aware there’s a report of another woman having been followed.”

Mary Bosson, a cousin of the PCSO's mum, said: ""It is worrying. We all walk our dogs around that area. I have a pregnant granddaughter and she walks her two dogs around there.

""She was there Monday and Tuesday, on her own. We don't know if it was random or what. We won't be doing it now until we find out.""

Dorothy Morgan said: ""It's so chilling. She was a really nice girl. I just can't believe it. We seldom walk about, but I've seen more people walking around in twos. Quite a lot of people have dogs here.""

Another mum, who also lives nearby, said she won't walk her dog on the path where Julia was found.

""I used to go most days on my own but I just wouldn't do that now"", she said.

""I'm also having to take my daughter to school, whereas normally she'd take the bus. I don't want her walking on her own, or waiting for it on her own, and I think most parents will probably be doing the same thing.

""There's obviously quite a big police presence so hopefully everything will be OK, and we have a strong community, which is nice.""

Julia worked for Kent Police's domestic violence unit, where she is said to have been a ""devoted"" advocate for victims.

Cops from the force's serious crime directorate are examining whether her killer was in the area the previous day.

The tragedy happened just two-and-a-half miles from the site of the horrific 1996 Chillenden murders

The crime scene is two miles across fields from where Lin Russell and her daughter Megan were bludgeoned to death in July 1996 in Chillenden.

Lin's older daughter Josie, then nine, survived.

Locals say Julia's brings vivid memories back of the horror killings 25 years ago.

The neighbour, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: “It’s just too close to home.

""You associate it with what happened in Chillenden. It makes you think, have we got someone going around killing people in the woods?

“It’s such a wide remote area so presumably whoever has done this awful thing knew the area and knows all the routes out.

""It’s a very popular path and a beautiful woods full of wildlife. Then suddenly this shocking tragedy mars it.”

Julia had two children - a daughter who works for the police and a 23-year-old son. She also had a grandson.

Son Patrick Davis has taken to Facebook to say a heartbreaking goodbye to his beloved mum.

He wrote: “Mum, I cannot believe I’m even writing this.

""I love you to the moon and back.

""I’m in complete shock and I still don’t even think this is real, but I just hope wherever you may be that you’re happy and comfy because that’s all you deserve.

“You were the most amazing, loving, caring, mother anyone could ever ask for and the circumstances that surround this just don’t make sense.

“I appreciate everyone’s messaging and stuff but I’ve got to ask for people to let me and my family have some space at the moment.

“Fly high mum, I love you so much.”

Officers ramped up the investigation yesterday with cops seen carrying out meticulous fingertip searches in remote woodland and fields.

The search area has now been widened to a railway line that connects Snowdown and the village of Aylesham.

Her heartbroken colleagues left a touching note for tragic Julia on a floral tribute today.

It read: ""PCSO Julia James. Your duty is done. Take it easy for now we will take it from here!

""Thinking of your family at this time. From the guys in blue xx"".

Police haven't confirmed if Julia, who is thought to have worked in the domestic violence unit at Kent Police, was on duty at the time.

During the 40-minute attack, he punched her in the face before threatening to stab and rape her if she made a noise, Teeside Live reports.

Metcalfe terrorised his victim in her own home, and said he would bury her in the ground.

The terrified woman fled her home to raise the alarm, following her shocking ordeal on October 31 last year.

After returning home with the police she found her £500 television had been smashed and a hole punched through a bathroom door.

Metcalfe, originally from Darlington, Durham, was arrested and charged with making threats to kill, common assault and criminal damage.

He pleaded guilty to the offences and was jailed for two years at Teeside Crown Court.

The vile yob was also handed a three-year restraining order.

Investigating officer Heidi Weir, who led the investigation for Durham Police, said: “This was a terrifying ordeal for the woman, who not only feared for her life but for the life of her unborn child.

“She showed great bravery by escaping from the property, raising the alarm, and supporting a police investigation.

The Loose Women star, 62, said The 1975 frontman Matt was just one-year-old during the episode, which occurred on a flight to Australia to visit then-husband Tim Healy, 69, on the set of a BBC TV series.

Hollyoaks actress Denise told Laura Dockrill, 34, on her Zombiemum podcast: ""I had made the decision because he was missing his child so much that I would fly to Australia.

""The night before I went, this massive depression came on. I cannot tell you what it was like to go the airport and get on that plane with this depression.

8 Denise, pictured here with a young Matt and her ex-husband Tim Healy, began suffering depression following the youngster's birth. Credit: Rex

""When I was in the air - I told Matthew this years later when he was a grown up, I would never have put this on any child - I wished that the plane would go down in my mind.

""I wished that it would, because then I wouldn't have made the decision. And people might go, 'There was other people on the plane, how selfish' - of course.

8 Denise's mental health episode occurred when she flew out to Australia to reunite one-year-old Matt with Tim on a TV series shoot. Credit: Rex

""It was the point that I wanted something out of my control and I thought, 'Why doesn't it just go down and then I will be out of this pain'. Now I can't believe I had those thoughts.""

Denise experienced her first episode of depression following the birth of Matt in 1989 and used to wish she could go back to life before she became a mother.

Denise Welch opens up on why she posted about her clinical depression online

She said: ""I just remember thinking, 'Who is this baby?' Looking at the baby thinking, 'Why have I got this baby?' And within an hour I was in a black suicidal depression and that was the start of my journey.

""I was almost incapable of getting off the settee. I lost two stone in three weeks and my mum had to sit there trying to make me have food replacements.

8 Denise admitted she would ""dream of life before a baby"" after giving birth to Matt in 1989. Credit: Instagram

""I literally used to wait until my medication like I was in a hospital like One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.

""The sad thing about life then was it was like a reverse nightmare. I would go to bed, have a dream of my life before a baby and wake up in the nightmare.

YOU'RE NOT ALONE EVERY 90 minutes in the UK a life is lost to suicide. It doesn't discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society - from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers. It's the biggest killer of people under the age of 35, more deadly than cancer and car crashes. And men are three times more likely to take their own life than women. Yet it's rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now. That is why The Sun launched the You're Not Alone campaign. The aim is that by sharing practical advice, raising awareness and breaking down the barriers people face when talking about their mental health, we can all do our bit to help save lives. Let's all vow to ask for help when we need it, and listen out for others... You're Not Alone.

""I never wanted to harm my child but I just wanted everything to go away.""

Denise said she considered suicide ""a safety valve"" at the time, adding: ""Had I not had the family I had, without a doubt, either through purpose or accident, I would probably not be here now.""

Despite feeling ""incredibly lucky"" for the support of her loved ones, she recalled becoming jealous of Matt as a baby after her late mother Ann, who died of cancer in 2012, doted on him.

She said: ""She'd been blindsided by this immediate love for this child.

""I was 31 and I do remember saying to her, 'You do love me more than Matty, don't you?' and her saying, 'Of course I do'. I mean, God, what is that about?""

Celebrity Big Brother winner Denise, who is also mum to son Louis, 20, has continued to fight depression and advocate for mental health awareness ever since.

It was during a breakdown in 2005, which forced her to pull out of a pantomime in Stockport, that she realised her illness would never be taken seriously - even though she was having some of her darkest thoughts at the time.

She said: ""I was driving to work [on the panto] in the morning and I wanted my car to crash.

""I know I didn't want to die, but I wanted the pain to be taken away. I wanted the car to crash and someone to take me to hospital and give me tablets so that everything would go away and everyone would understand how poorly I was.

""The most hurtful thing ever said about me was in the local paper. 'Denise Welch walked out of the pantomime today disappointing thousands of young children.'

""'But' - and I will make a fictitious name - 'Suzie Snodgrass playing Snow White went on despite a broken wrist and kept the audience happy'. That just summed up to me the lack of understanding.""

Denise, who penned bestselling book The Unwelcome Visitor about her struggles, hasn't suffered a severe depressive episode since September 2019 and has been sober for over eight years.

She said: ""What I have come to terms with is I have zero guilt now about what happened to me, but what I do have guilt and shame about is how I chose to deal with that with alcohol and drugs.

Pawel Relowicz, 26, was last month caged for life with a minimum of 27 years after raping and murdering the 21-year-old student in Hull.

But his sentence could now be increased after his case was referred to the Attorney General.

A spokesman said: ""We have received a request for the sentence of Pawel Relowicz to be considered under the Sentence scheme.

""The Law Officers have 28 days from sentencing to consider the case and make a decision.""

During a trial earlier this year, jurors heard how Libby was ""extremely vulnerable"" when she was spotted by Relowicz, who was prowling the streets looking for a victim.

After forcing Libby in his car, the dad-of-two drove her to remote playing fields where he raped her before dumping her dead or dying in the river Hull.

She was discovered six weeks later on March 20, 2019, in the Humber estuary by a fishing boat - a gold necklace bearing the letter 'L' still hanging around her neck.

PEEPING TOM

Relowicz was a convicted pervert who was described as a ""disgusting"" Peeping Tom who ""violated intimate moments"" by his own lawyer.

The fiend previously pleaded guilty to nine sexually motivated offences including voyeurism, outraging public decency and burglary.

He had exposed himself to women and performed sex acts on himself in the street in the year leading up to Libby's death.

Relowicz also watched them through their windows as they changed or had sex and swiped underwear and sex toys from women's homes as ""trophies"".

His last offence occurred just days before Libby went missing in 2019.

Sickeningly, the married dad-of-two admitted he had a ""fetish"" and was looking for ""easy sex"" on the night Libby vanished.

Relowicz forced Libby's parents to listen to his callous web of lies during a lengthy trial - including claiming he had consensual sex with Libby.

But jurors saw through his deception and yesterday convicted him of rape and murder at Sheffield Crown Court after 27 hours and 55 minutes of deliberation.

It came just over two years after philosophy and religion student Libby vanished in Hull on February 1, 2019.

'I LONG TO DIE'

Libby's mum Lisa revealed her ""torture"" at her daughter's death and how she ""silently screams in pain"".

She told Sheffield Crown Court in a powerful victim impact statement: ""There are no words that can explain the torture of living without my Libby. She was a sister, a grandaughter, niece and cousin.

“I have not only lost my daughter but the opportunity to be a grandmother to her children. In any times of trouble she wanted me, her mum. Knowing I was not there when she needed me will haunt me for the rest of my life.

“I now live in two worlds where I live as a mother, wife, friend and employee but there is also a world that will run parallel and is a dark and lonely world.

""In this world I long to die so I can be with my girl. I wake up with disappointment that I will live another day.

""This is a world where I silently scream in pain and pray that one day we will be reunited in a dream, a world where we constantly look for signs in every rainbow.

The woman - who can't be named for legal reasons - said she supported a campaign to shun the holiday spot saying she believes the resort of Ayia Napa is unsafe.

7 The teen's mother has labelled parts of Cyprus unsafe following her daughter's conviction

""The place isn't safe - it is absolutely not safe,"" she told Radio 4's Today programme after labelling the court's verdict ""absolutely astonishing"".

""And if you go and report something that's happened to you, you're either laughed at, as far as I can tell, or, in the worst case, something like what's happened to my daughter may happen,""

The teenager said she was raped by up to 12 Israeli tourists in a hotel room in the party town on July 17.

But she was charged and the dozen young men, aged between 15 and 20, who were arrested over the incident, were freed after she signed a retraction statement 10 days later.

The woman said her daughter is experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), hallucinations, and is sleeping for up to 20 hours a day because of a condition called hypersomnia.

""She needs to get back to the UK to get that treated - that's my absolute primary focus.

""She can't be treated here because hearing foreign men speaking loudly will trigger an episode.

7 The teen and her mum wore masks with stitches on the lips in protest at her treatment as they left court

""It needs resolving otherwise she's going to carry on having this for the rest of her life,"" the woman said.

She said her daughter had planned to go to university this year after being accepted for the courses she applied for and being offered a bursary at one institute.

""So, no question, she would have gone to university, but it was in a career that she wouldn't be able to do with this 'public mischief' verdict, so - again, life-changing for her - she needs to totally rethink her options.""

A crowdfunding appeal to raise money for legal support for her daughter has passed £80,000.

The ""help teen victim get justice in Cyprus"" GoFundMe page was set up by British lawyer John Hobbs in August to raise cash for the 19-year-old's legal representation.

The teenager claimed in court she was raped but forced to change her account under pressure from Cypriot police.

7 The hotel room where the woman claimed the assault took place

The Foreign Office said the UK was ""seriously concerned"" about the fairness of the woman's trial and it is understood officials have raised the ""deeply distressing case"" with the Cypriot authorities.

Her mother said she would ""definitely"" like the British government to intervene in the case.

She told Radio 4: ""I would love the Foreign Secretary to get involved, that would be fantastic.""

She said they will be appealing against the verdict ""without question"" and hoped the FCO could help them progress the case to the Cypriot Supreme Court.

She added: ""Unfortunately there's quite a long waiting list, so our lawyers are looking at what could be done to expedite that.

""That's something maybe the Foreign Office can help us with.""

Lawyers and campaigners criticised the justice system after she was convicted of public mischief at Famagusta District Court, in Paralimni, on Monday.

There are now reports some of those originally accused of the attack have friends in high places.

While the boys’ identities have not been released because they were minors at the time, some of their parents appear to be close to the Israeli establishment, it's claimed.

One of their fathers is even an adviser to an important mayor, reports the Times.

It reports there is now the impression that the 12 had at least some backing from powerful figures.

However, the government of Cyprus has said it has ""full confidence in the justice system and the courts"".

The ring legend says he urged the rapper to come and see him take on Bruce Seldon at the MGM Grand on September 7, 1996.

Hours after Tyson stopped his rival in the first round, Tupac - who had a ringside seat for the big fight - was gunned down in a drive-by shooting as he headed to a gig at Club 662 in Sin City.

Rap mogul Suge Knight was in a black BMW next to Tupac when they were targeted by a mystery gunman in a suspected revenge hit.

And Tyson also revealed he was due to hook up with his pal at the nightspot but instead stayed in to look after his new baby.

In a VladTV interview, boxer Zab Judah asks the former heavyweight champ how he felt when he heard Tupac had been killed.

Tyson replied: ""It was a really bad day when that happened....it was really bad.

""I felt a little guilty about him coming to the fight....me pressuring him (saying) 'hey you wanna bring the tape, don't forget the tape.""

The tape Tyson was referring to was the customised music to be used for his entrance to the ring.

""I was going to go out with him that night. I promised to go with him to the 662.

""But I had just had a little baby and her mother provoked me to stay at home.

""Someone called me that night and told me what happened....and I come to me senses.

""This is what happens in my world...that was part of my world. But just because it was Tupac and I was attached to it, it was different.

""I expect someone to die after a fight or somebody to get hurt or something crazy to happen but when it happened to him at was different.""

Tupac was involved in his own fight the night Tyson stepped into the ring in Vegas.

He and his crew - some with links to LA street gang the Bloods - attacked rival Orlando 'Baby Lane' Anderson in the casino-hotel.

It was a brawl some believe ultimately led to the much-loved rapper's shocking death.

Tyson and Tupac were close friends in the 1990s and the boxer received prison visits from the music star while behind bars following his conviction for rape in 1992.

He was assigned to the Indiana Youth Center, where he would regularly be visited by celebrities.

But Tyson revealed recently the most respected guest that came to see him was the hip hop legend.

He told rapper TI: “The guards didn’t like him, the inmates got rowdy and pumped up when he came which is a safety concern.

""He was a bolt of energy there. When he came in everybody knew him, he had mad respect. That’s how he lived his life, he had mad respect.""

Shakur himself served time for sexual assault after being convicted during a showcase trial in 1994.

Tyson returned to the ring in 1995 after his release, with his comeback fight against Peter McNeeley grossing £79m worldwide and selling a then record 1.52m PPV's, equating to £51m.

Just a year later he beat Frank Bruno to win the WBC title, but then lost to Evander Holyfield before infamously biting his ear in their 1997 rematch.

But what happened to these teen heartthrobs who gained legions of fans thanks to their ripped six-packs and floppy boyband haircuts?

18 EastEnders heartthrob Paul Nicholls certainly grabbed attention when he joined in 1996 Credit: Rex Features

We catch up with some soap favourites to see what happened after they bowed out of the likes of EastEnders, Corrie and Hollyoaks...

Paul Nicholls (EastEnders)

EastEnders heartthrob Paul Nicholls made a name for himself and became a teen pin-up when he joined the cast of EastEnders in March 1996.

During his 18 month in the Square, Paul played Joe Wicks, who had schizophrenia. His portrayal of the condition won huge praise from viewers.

Before starring in the hit BBC soap, he was a child star, appearing in Children's Ward, Earthfasts and The Biz.

Paul Nicholls is still looking good at 41

He starred in EastEnders in the 90s

The actor is still regularly papped when he is out and about, reminding fans that he's still got his devilishly handsome looks.

Since leaving EastEnders, Paul has had several roles both in TV and film.

He has starred in City Central, Harley Street, Secret Diary of a Call Girl, Law & Order: UK and Holby City.

Paul also starred alongside Renee Zellweger playing bad boy Jed in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason.

In 2017 Paul was rushed to hospital after plummeting from a jungle waterfall in Thailand and spending three days trapped in a rock pool with a smashed leg - he only survived thanks to a sharp-eyed Thai local.

Chris Fountain (Hollyoaks)

Every girl loves a bad boy and Hollyoaks proved to be no different when Chris Fountain joined in 2003 as heart throb Justin Burton.

Justin had many explosive storylines – who else remembers Justin getting his teacher pregnant? Or pushing his sister through a window?

After leaving in 2009 he went on to play Tommy Duckworth in Coronation Street, came runner up on Dancing on Ice, and played a number of roles in Casualty and other shows.

Chris, now 33, was sacked from Corrie in 2013 after a foul-mouthed video of him in a Halloween mask with a baseball cap and hoodie emerged.

It showed him rapping about rape, drugs and extreme violence as hip hop character ‘The Phantom’.

He said at the time: “I would like to sincerely apologise for any offence I have caused. I am deeply ashamed by the lyrics and very much regret my behaviour.

“The videos were made over a year ago when I was experimenting with music and I’ve not done anything like it since and nor will I.”

Jack Ryder (EastEnders)

Ex-EastEnders star Jack Ryder looked completely unrecognisable as thrilled Loose Women viewers called him a ""hottie"" back in May 2020.

The 39-year-old is best known for playing Jamie Mitchell in the BBC One soap from 1998 to 2002.

He left Albert Square after his character was sensationally killed off on Christmas Day 2002, when he was run over by a car driven by love rival Martin Fowler.

In the same year, Jack married Kym Marsh, who was yet to find fame playing Michelle Connor on Coronation Street and was then best known as one fifth of the Popstars band Hear'Say.

The couple divorced in 2009, around the time Jack started to turn to more directing roles, and has starred in Holby City and Doctors.

Eighteen years on since his dramatic exit, fans were over the moon about the throwback as he appeared on the daytime show.

Nigel Harman (Eastenders)

Former EastEnders star Nigel Harman, 47, has undergone something of a transformation since his days in Walford.

The actor - who played badboy Dennis Rickman in the BBC soap from 2003-2005 - has shown off his flowing locks in recent years.

Nigel left his role on EastEnders - which landed him numerous awards and nominations - just before Christmas 2005 and his final scenes saw his character stabbed to death in the street.

Since his stint on Albert Square, Harman has had a string of TV and theatre roles.

He had a string of on-screen romances, including Leanne Battersby, Maria Sutherland, his sister-in-law Carla.

Things didn’t end well for Rob’s character when Carla’s partner, Tony, hired a hitman to kill him in 2008.

Former telly heart-throb Nick Berry looks in, er, different nick these days.

The ex-Heartbeat star, 57, who was spotted last year in Essex, made his last TV appearance back in 2012 in a one-off EastEnders episode for the funeral of his on-screen mother Pat Butcher. And it seems like a lot has changed since then…

Nick first began playing EastEnders' Simon Wicks in 1985 — the hit soap's first year. He left after five years when his character emigrated.

At one point he tried his hand at singing and landed a No1 hit in 1986 called Every Loser Wins before returning to acting to play PC Nick Rowan in Heartbeat.

The TV star looked very different when he was spotted in Essex last year

After his six-year stint on Heartbeat, Berry moved to the BBC where he starred in the show Harbour Lights.

The show was less successful than his previous roles, with the coastal drama being axed after two series.

At the age of 39 he turned his back on acting for good and focused on being a stay-at-home father to his two sons.

Essex actor Gary Lucy played the brooding Luke Morgan in Hollyoaks.

The 38-year-old was part of a controversial rape storyline, which was the first time the issue had been tackled in a British soap.

After his show exit, Gary went on to star in EastEnders and the ITV talent show Dancing on Ice.

Gary also won a host of female admirers for his raunchy role in Footballers’ Wives and later the Full Monty, where fans could watch him strip down on stage.

Since then he has played Steve Connolly in the ITV detective drama Broadchurch in 2013, and in 2016 he played armed response officer Rod Kennedy in the popular BBC cop drama Line of Duty.

Weinstein was convicted of two counts of sex crimes on two women February 24, 2020 and sentenced to 23 years in jail on March 11, 2020. A new accuser came out on March 26, 2021 claiming she stabbed his genitals with her broken nail while fighting him off. Here's everything we know about how much he's worth now.

What is Harvey Weinstein's net worth?

The former film producer and co-founder of Miramax Films is now worth $50 million, according to Wealthy Gorilla. While Celebrity Net Worth puts his wealth at just $25 million.

However, the disgraced movie mogul was once worth an estimated $300 million based on the valuation of The Weinstein Company he began with his brother Bob Weinstein.

In 2015, before Weinstein's sex scandals rocked the world, Forbes valued his stake in the production company at $130 million.

Weinstein's fortunes took a further dip when the scandals lead to him being fired from his own company and his British fashion designer wife Georgina Chapman filing for divorce in October 2017.

He was forced to pay Chapman a reported $20 million divorce settlement.

But at times he was reportedly too broke to pay other spousal support obligations. In January 2017, a judge issued a temporary halt $5 million he owed his first wife and former assistant Eve Chilton and their two children when Weinsten said he couldn't afford to pay.

But she claimed he had used his cash to pre-pay millions in lawyer fees to safeguard himself against several potential lawsuits around the world.

Both ex-wives refused to vouch for the convicted sex offender at his sentencing.

How did Harvey Weinstein make his money?

Weinstein launched film company Miramax, in 1979, with his brother Bob using profits from their successful concert promotion business.

In 1989, Miramax had a breakthrough with 'Sex, Lies and Videotape' - which became one of their most successful films.

The Walt Disney company bought Miramax in 1993 but the Weinstein brothers still exercised creative and financial independence within the Disney-owned company up until 2005.

The pair launched The Weinstein Company in 2005, an American independent film studio based in New York City.

Weinstein was fired from the company in 2017 when the sexual harassment allegations came to light.

The following year the company declared bankruptcy.

What films has Harvey Weinstein produced? Weinstein produced a wealth of well-known films such as 'Shakespeare In Love', 'Gangs of New York' and 'Pulp Fiction'. Meryl Streep once jokingly referred to him as ""God"". But his most recent movie Tulip Fever was branded a critical disaster. Weinstein has 328 credits as a producer or executive producer in films and TV, according to IMBb. He has been involved in financing other projects. Some of his biggest hits include: Gangs Of New York (2002)

IT’S easy to laugh at snowflakes wanting kids banned from the Tower of London in case they are triggered by its bloody past. And, yes, we are doing just that.

But there’s a serious point. Years of left-wing dominance in schools and universities have produced a generation convinced they have a right not to be offended or hear a disobliging opinion.

IT’S easy to laugh at snowflakes wanting kids banned from the Tower of London, but there's a serious point, writes The Sun Credit: Getty - Contributor

That kids and adults must be shielded from life’s uncomfortable realities with trigger warnings and safe spaces. Boris Johnson has many battles ahead.

But he must not overlook steering our education system away from corrosive left-wing snowflakery and back towards common-sense teaching which equips young people for real life.

Besides . . . for some kids the horror is all that makes history interesting.

Rape scandal

THE treatment of a British teenager allegedly gang-raped in a Cyprus hotel stinks. The 19-year-old was convicted of lying that 12 Israeli tourists attacked her.

All were freed when she signed a retraction after hours with police who denied her a lawyer. Yet a pathologist found evidence he believes supports claims that she WAS raped.

We share Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab’s worries about her case.

How safe are women partying in Ayia Napa?

Cyprus is no banana republic. It’s in the EU and Commonwealth.

Yet at best it is guilty of grotesque unfairness, at worst an obscene miscarriage of justice.

Mr Raab must not let up in his diplomatic efforts to get this woman freed — and must back her appeal to higher courts.

Labour’s lost

DID Labour ever actually want power? Corbyn clearly relished leading the “resistance” to a massive Tory majority all along.

Her mate Angela Rayner is a droning foghorn who spreads lies for Twitter “likes”.

Keir Starmer, the nitwit behind Labour’s fatal Remain position, tells new Tory voters in Leigh that they “need” Labour. Just marvel at that entitlement.

These no-hopers make little sense if the hard-Left genuinely want to rule. What if they simply prefer protesting?

24 Sachin filmed a tearful video in hospital moments after being told his wife and unborn baby had died from Covid

24 He told the BBC doctors should have been able to save pregnant wife Anjali

The emotional video emerged as India recorded a global record number of infections for the sixth day running and the death toll passed 200,000.

Experts believe the true figure could be five times that as many deaths outside hospital have not been recorded.

PM Narendra Modi has been accused of failing to invest in creaking medical services, leading to a shortage of beds and oxygen supplies when the devastating second wave hit.

Sachin, from Uttar Pradesh, told the BBC doctors wasted three days shunting Anjali between different hospitals for tests instead of treating her.

Moments after being told she and their unborn child were dead, he filmed himself shouting out for a doctor to explain why she could not be saved.

Sachin, who has two other kids, said later: ""I had so much pain inside me, as if someone had ripped my heart out of my chest.

""I knew I needed to raise my voice against the system.

He added: ""This disease can be dangerous but our system is even more dangerous.""

""We were not able to save her because of such mismanagement all around Delhi.""

Eslewhere today, shocking footage showed a man forced to carry his wife for a mile to a cremation ground after authorities refused to help in Kamareddy, near Hyderabad.

And Covid patients were treated with oxygen in the back of cars after they were turned away from hospitals in Delhi and Ghaziabad.

Today India recorded a new global high of 362,757 daily infections, and another 3,293 deaths, its highest figure yet.

It means it is the fourth country to pass 200,000 deaths, after the US, Mexico and Brazil.

Experts have warned there could be 500,000 cases a day next month and another 750,000 deaths by August as the virus spreads out of control.

Crematoriums are operating round the clock to cope with thousands of daily deaths - and experts say worse is to come.

Delhi emergency medic Dr Shaarang Sachdev told Sky News: ""This pandemic is the worst we have ever seen until now.

""The next two weeks are going to be hell for us.""

Hundreds of patients have reportedly died in recent days because hospitals ran short of life-saving oxygen.

Others died on hospital doorsteps begging for air because there were no beds.

The shortage has sparked a 1,500 per cent hike in the price of black market oxygen, with some families paying £900 for £60 cylinders.

Antiviral drug remdesivir has also rocketed in price 20-fold.

Last night it was reported some desperate virus victims were hurling themselves off buildings.

A West Bengal man was reported to have leapt to his death from a hospital roof after testing positive.

In Patna in the north east, a railway worker beheaded his wife when she caught the virus then leapt to his death from their apartment.

Film also emerged showing a victim’s body falling from an overloaded ambulance en route to a crematorium.

The virus has already engulfed Delhi and Mumbai and is now ravaging giant port city Kolkata, home to 15million.

Around half of Covid tests there are coming back positive, compared with one in 20 at the start of April.

The surge has been blamed partly on forthcoming elections in the surrounding state of West Bengal.

PM Narendra Modi has come under fire for staging a ""super spreader"" election rally attended by thousands of supporters of his BJP party.

Meanwhile, judges at the Madras High Court said ""irresponsible"" Election Commission officials should face possible murder charges for allowing rallies to go ahead.

India was once seen as a success story in beating the pandemic but Mr Modi now stands accused of cover-ups and dismal failure.

His government has mobilised army medics to help support overwhelmed hospitals.

But he was slammed for ordering Twitter to censor criticism of his handling of the crisis.

She should have arrived back home in Brixton around 50 minutes later but the marketing manager has not been since.

As the search reaches its fifth day, The Sun Online looks at the six clues surrounding Sarah's disappearance.

JOURNEY HOME ALONE

Sarah leaves a friend's home on March 3 at around 9pm.

She exits the house on Leathwaite Road, Clapham, through a back gate on to the A205 South Circular.

Sarah was wearing a green waterproof jacket, navy blue trousers with a white diamond pattern.

She is described as 5’4, blonde hair and of slim build.

FINAL MOVEMENTS

Sarah begins walking the 50-minute journey back to her home in nearby Brixton.

The marketing manager is believed to have walked across Clapham Common.

Her uncle Nick Everard describes her as a ""bright young woman, very sensible"" who had lived in London ""for a long time so I imagine was very streetwise"".

CALL WITH BOYFRIEND

Sarah is on the phone to her boyfriend for around 15 minutes just before 9.30pm.

Her friend Rose Woollard said her phone signal was picked up last near Clarence Avenue.

This is between her home and where she left her pal's home.

Her other uncle Doug Everard says: ""She was in touch with her boyfriend on a call and that is the last contact.""

LAST SIGHTING

Police reveal fresh CCTV images of Sarah on the journey.

It shows her at the junction of Poynders Road and Cavendish Road at around 9.30pm, heading in the direction of Tulse Hill.

Sarah can be seen on the phone in the image but it is not clear if she is still chatting to her boyfriend or someone else.

She has not been seen since.

MURDER COPS TAKE OVER

Sarah is reported missing on Thursday after friends and family are unable to get in touch with her.

The Met also ask residents along Sarah's route home to check their CCTV and dashcam footage.

Police say they are ""increasingly concerned"" as ponds and bins on Clapham Common are searched.

Murder cops have now taken over the investigation, which is still being treated as a missing person's probe.

They say there is no information to suggest ""anything untoward"" happened to Sarah.

Nick Everard pleads with any potential abductors to ""just to be human and to let her come home""

PHONE SWITCHED OFF

Sarah's family reveal her phone is off and she is not receiving messages.

Her uncle Nick Everard says this is ""out of character"" for Sarah.

He added: “She didn't have any troubles and was fit and healthy. She was happy, she had just started a new job and she had a boyfriend,"" he said.



“She is a lovely person. She would never just take time out without contacting her family. It would be completely out of character.



“Her mobile phone is not ringing and she’s not received any WhatsApp messages we’ve been sending her.""

But she still has to put up with idiots online that can't handle the success of a woman in football.

Speaking to the Daily Mail, she said: ""I do feel pressure to do it right.

""I have watched women drown in positions in which they haven’t been given support. I have seen what that has done to women’s reputations.

""We are all striving for equality but the reaction to a woman on screen or radio is still not equal. A producer once told me that women reporters have higher to fall from.

""It stuck with me. It’s not just what you say, it’s how you look, the way your voice sounds.

""I have had it all in tweets and stuff. You are underweight. You are overweight. You have too much make-up. You look tired. Men have to deal with scrutiny, too. I know. But their knowledge is never attacked in the same way.

""Women have transitioned into some sports such as cricket incredibly well. But what is it about football that people can’t accept something if it’s coming out of a woman’s mouth?

""Women can be brain surgeons. They can save your life. They can go to the moon. But they can’t give you an opinion about football. It’s bonkers.

""I am a sensitive person. I can get upset. So I need time for me. But I also try to help when I can. I got a message during lockdown from a girl with an eating disorder on Instagram. I did what I could for her. I listened. But I am not a doctor.

""There are some wonderful girls on Twitter who I follow. Young journalists who have the balls to put their work out there and they get dogs’ abuse.

""Racist, sexist, rape threats, death threats. The deepest stuff you could imagine. I mentioned one of them on the show and she got in touch to say thanks. That is when I realised what I say can go a long way.

""I was naive to that a little. I felt a sense of responsibility then. I owe an amount to other people, not just me.

""Do I want to tackle important issues on the show? Do I want to show I deserve this award? Do I want to make an impression on young women? Do I want to be a role model? The answer to all of that is yes. I choose to be this.""

Woods, 33, took over from Alan Brazil on talkSPORT's Breakfast show a year ago, coinciding with the first national lockdown.

While finding her feet in the role, she admits that things became extremely difficult in isolation.

Woods said: ""I had a torrid time at the start and was really struggling. There was this wave of pressure taking over from Alan. I felt I was ruining it for the audience.

""It was a weird war with my own emotions. I loved having the show and wanted to do a really good job. But I knew what the audience were feeling because I was feeling it too. So the timing couldn’t have been worse.

""Living on my own was difficult. I needed to come home, have a cuddle or go to the pub, watch TV or something.

The show would be four hours of non-stop talk and then I would get home to a closed door and total silence. It was, “What now? Laura Woods

""Instead, my housemate had moved out and it was a small flat with no garden. I felt as though the walls were closing in on me.

""The show would be four hours of non-stop talk and then I would get home to a closed door and total silence. It was, 'What now?'

""I would go for a walk but feel so aimless. The only access to the outside world was social media and at that time it was not my friend. I just felt this huge weight of negative opinion.

""I wanted comforts so I was eating loads. I am not a big drinker but I would have three bottles of cider at home. Those were the moments where I thought, 'This feels dark'. I couldn’t shake myself out of it.""

The Supreme Court issued its ruling yesterday despite a lengthy battle for justice by the victim and her family.

4 Demonstrators have vented their anger at the sexual abuse of Julie when she was a schoolgirl

The ruling comes despite a decision made on Monday by politicians to back new laws setting an age of consent at 15, paving the way to ensure that adults who have sex with children younger than 15 are prosecuted for rape.

Until the law comes into force, there is currently no age of consent in France, meaning there needs to be proof sex with an under-18 was non-consensual in order to obtain a rape conviction.

The girl – now aged 26 and known as Julie – was let down by authorities and the legal system, says her mum Corinne Leriche after years of abuse by the firefighters who treated her as a “sexual object”.

Her family have expressed their anger at the “sexist, erroneous” judgement, which they say is based on “archaic ideology”.

It validates a false vision of the balance of power between an adult and minor Corinne Leriche

“[The judgement] validates a false vision of the balance of power between an adult and a minor,” said the Leriche family.

“It embraces the sexist, erroneous and violent representations of sexuality and, at the same time that all of society is rising up against this archaic ideology today.

“This judgment is undoubtedly at odds with reality and with France's international obligations.”

Julie says 20 firefighters had sex with her when she was aged between 13 and 15 in her house, in the fire station and in a hospital toilet.

The abuse happened after the emergency services were called to help when Julie was unwell at home, around 130 times over the two-year period.

She eventually told her mum, who reported it to cops and although no action was taken against 17 of the firefighters, three of them were charged with sexual abuse.

Her mum told BFMTV the firefighters called her daughter the “coch”, or “slut” and had her number posted in their barracks in Paris.

In an earlier ruling, magistrates refused to prosecute the firefighters for rape after deciding Julie had not been forced to have sex with them and was “provocative and flirtatious”.

Julie contested the decision before the Supreme Court, arguing her age, health problems and medication she was taking that made her lethargic meant she could not be considered to have consented to sex.

Judges dismissed her case, ruling that “the victim had the necessary discernment” and there was no proof she had been obliged to have sex.

The firefighters will now be tried for sexual abuse, which carries a maximum sentence of seven years in jail, rather than rape, which has a maximum sentence of 20 years.

What is the age of consent in France? In France, there is no official age of consent. However, adults who sleep with children under the age of 15 can be convicted - yet lawyers have to prove the sex was non-consensual to obtain a conviction of rape. If the underage victim cannot prove they were forced or coerced into sex, then the accused may only be charged with sexual violation which carries a maximum jail term of just seven years. In 2018, protests over a case of a man in his late-20s having sex with an 11-year-old led to a change in the consent laws being proposed in France. However, the law was not passed after a report by the government said such a change would lead to ""an assumption of guilt.""

Shockwaves have spread across France, as supporters of the #JusticePourJulie campaign shared their outrage at the court’s judgement.

One tweeted: “Still in shock, still outraged by the decision of the court.""

Another highlighted that firefighters’ duty is to “protect” citizens.

“Knowing how to say no to sexual relations with a minor is the basis,” they wrote.

“France is losing its ethics. In order to preserve children there must be sanctions.”

A third supporter raged: “What does 'human rights' mean for #Julie? The right to be raped from 13 to 15 years by 20 adults who will be protected by their accomplices of justice?

“Julie is a victim, she was vulnerable, justice does not understand it, we are in 2021! #JusticeForJulie.”

Mme Leriche, who says that her daughter is now disabled after throwing herself out of a window and breaking three vertebrae, described the ruling as a “permit to rape”.

She added the court had “missed an opportunity” to clampdown on rapists and now plans to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights.

It doesn't discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society - from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers.

Bobby Singh, abused by a Pakistani family friend as a child, says the women ""know full well what their husbands are doing"" but are terrified of reporting it for fear of deportation.

The 40-year-old mum-of-three, who bravely waived her anonymity, told The Sun Online these women ""live in fear"" of being sent back to Pakistan and so keep quiet.

Her intervention comes as a damning report today found dozens of kids had been abused by Asian grooming gangs operating in ""plain sight"" after being failed by cops.

Some victims subject to ""profound abuse"" told carers and police officers about the sexual assaults but no action was taken, according to the report into child sexual exploitation in Manchester.

The report concluded: ""This is a depressingly familiar picture and has been seen in many other towns and cities across the country.""

It also found that fears over appearing racist played a part in senior police thinking when dealing with grooming gangs.

Bobby revealed how she was shunned by her own family when she opened up about horrendous abuse she suffered from the age of four to 14.

Bobby, a Hindu, said she is still seen as the ""black sheep"" of the family after running away from home.

She fled after years of abuse by Sayeed Shah - the family friend who groomed her with Care Bears and sweets.

The mum said there is a ""mentality"" is ""to keep quiet"" - to avoid bringing shame on the family.

She thinks this culture is what allows grooming gangs throughout the UK to get away with their sick crimes.

Bobby believes more grooming gangs are at large across the country - because ""intimidated"" wives are too scared to report their husbands to cops.

She revealed: ""They are scared of them, they have a life here - the majority of them are from Pakistan, they’ll say ‘we’ll send you back’"".

Kids as young as 12 targeted by grooming gangs in UK THE South Yorkshire town of Rotherham was embroilled in a child sex abuse scandel from the late 1980s until the 2010s. Five British-Pakistani men were the first from a grooming gang to be sentenced in 2010 for sexual offences against girls aged 12-14. In August 2014 an inquiry commissioned by Rotherham Council found around 1,400 children had been abused between 1997 and 2013. The majority of abusers were found to be predominately British-Pakistani men - with the number of victims increasing in 2018 to more than 1,500. Seven more men were convicted in 2018 of sex crimes between 1998 and 2005. A £90m inquiry - Operation Stovewood - has identified 1,523 potential victims and is investigating allegations against 426 people, of whom 151 are designated suspects. So far four people have been convicted under Operation Stovewood, with a further 24 suspects charged and 68 interviewed under caution. The investigation has recorded 648 grooming crimes over a 16-year period. In Rochdale, Greater Manchester, 19 British-Pakistani men have been convicted after 47 girls were found to be victims of sex abuse, and last year it emerged up to 1,000 children could be victims of a huge sex ring in Telford - seven men were convicted over the abuse in 2013. And in December four members of a grooming gang, also from Telford, were found guilty of abusing a 12-year-old girl. In 2018 a group of 20 British Asian men from a grooming gang were convicted of more than 120 offences against 15 girls in Huddersfield. After a series of convictions of Asian men, Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, previously warned the Pakistani community of the dangers of ""burying their heads in the sand"" on the matter of sexual grooming.

The carer, from Croydon, added: ""But they know what their husbands are doing, they know what their brothers are doing, they know what their family members are doing.

“They are intimidated by their men.""

Bobby has urged them, and victims, to speak out to stop abuse from taking place and bring abusers to justice.

She added: ""They should be thinking ‘do you know what, if they can do that to these little girls, they could do that to our daughter’.

But they won’t think like that, because they’ve brainwashed them.

“It [grooming] seems to be a problem there [within the Asian community].

“I really want to go round to areas like that, I’ve contacted a couple of Asian resources down there but they are just like, they seem very scared. I’d want to go there to talk.

“At the end of the day, they live here. These people who live here and have indefinite leave to remain, they have a duty of care.

They are scared of them, they have a life here - the majority of them are from Pakistan, they’ll say ‘we’ll send you back’ Bobby Singh

""They have been accepted as members of this community and of this country, and is this how you repay them, by grooming the children of England?

""It’s their mentality, the Asian mentality - and that will never ever change – which is to keep quiet, which is if you know ‘whatever is heard or said in this house stays in this house, gets brushed under the carpet - you shut the door and forget about it’, that’s it.""

Due to this Bobby said it took her years to admit to her family the real reason why she ran away more than 30 years ago.

She had been groomed and abused by Sayeed Shah as a child, when he was in his 20s.

He became close with her family when they moved to Shirley, as one of few other Asian families in the area.

Shah showered the young Bobby with gifts and sweets - she had an entire glass case full of Care Bears from him - before he began to abuse her weekly.



CHILDHOOD TRAUMA

She suspects some of his family thought his close relationship with her was strange, but her parents had no idea why he engineered to spend so much time with her until she confessed a few years ago.

After bravely deciding to speak out, her case against Shah went to the Old Bailey, where he was sentenced on August 13, 2018, to 12 years behind bars.

She said: ""I get very angry because the people that say that ‘let’s leave it, let’s not say anything about it, whatever, my mum’s not got to live with it' – I have.

""I have lived with it for so long, and I have to live with it.

""Because of this, I have got mental health issues because of what he did to me - I cannot be normal.

""I suffer from panic attacks, I am on long term medication, I can’t sleep at night.

""Our parents that tell us not to talk about it or address it they are not going to be here forever.

'PROFOUND ABUSE' IN MANCHESTER Police investigating child sex exploitation in Manchester knew children were suffering ""the most profound abuse... but did not protect them"", a damning report has found today. The review, launched after a child's death in 2003, found at least 97 ""predominantly Asian men"" were suspected of offences, but ""very few"" were brought to justice. It was prompted by the death of Victoria, 15, a girl under the care of Manchester City Council, who reported being raped and injected with heroin by a 50-year-old Asian man. She died of a drugs overdose two months later on September 29, 2003. The police operation identified at least 57 victims and 97 potential suspects, some involved with Victoria, and a ""compelling picture of the systemic exploitation of looked after children in the care system"" was established by detectives. But senior officers at Greater Manchester Police chose to under-resource the investigation and a decision was then made to close it down in April 2005. The report looked at a ""sample"" of cases from the time, detailing a series of allegations of rape and sexual abuse made by girls that were not followed up and with no further action taken by GMP or the council. As a result, ""very few of the relevant perpetrators were brought to justice and neither were their activities disrupted"". This was despite ""clear evidence"" teenage girls, aged 12 to 16, were being sexually abused ""generally perpetrated by a group of older Asian men"" including the police having their names, where they lived or worked and the flats above take-away shops where the abuse took place. It included plying girls with drugs and alcohol, physical abuse, rape and being forced to have sex with multiple men at ""sex parties.""

Their raunchy night together was aired on E4 last month with the beauty filmed climbing into Sam's bed during their secret affair.

But when quizzed on the explicit scenes, Ines denied the pair enjoyed anything more than just a cuddle.

Speaking to Jamie Laing on his Private Parts podcast Ines, who was dubbed 'Australia's most hated bride', said: ""We didn't have sex.""

""No we didn't have sex!"" she said.

""There was a good editing trick there, I think they zoomed into a packet of condoms. Because they leave condoms in everyone's room.

""Yeah people find it really hard to (believe) that we didn't.""

The legal assistant turned Instagram influencer also opened up about the ""terrifying and brutal"" trolling she received after the show - leaving her fearing for her life.

The vile trolls also targeted the reality star's family and her little dog Carlos by sending terrifying messages.

The Aussie star said: “There are moments when it’s [trolling] coming in large amounts and it’s so savage.

""Brutal things like I’ll slit your throat and bathe in your blood, I’ll torture your mother, I’ll kill your dog. I’ve had rape threats, it’s really scary stuff.""

And the wild and shocking claims are continuing to rack up against the star of Call Me By Your Name, as it's now been alleged his ex ""compared him to Ted Bundy"".

A number of claims were made about the controversial actor, 34, in a new Vanity Fair exposé, with unnamed sources claiming his ex-wife Elizabeth Chambers, 38, had joked to friends that their marriage was comparable to the 2019 film Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile.

The Netflix film, which stars Zac Efron, chronicles the crimes of serial killer Ted Bundy.

The article also shared a look into Armie and Elizabeth's marriage, as one source claimed he introduced her to Shibari- a Japanese bondage art form that has people are tied up in intricate patterns.

But they're just the latest in a long line of scandalous allegations against him.

Back in January, a woman previously involved with Armie revealed screenshots of their alleged exchanges via Instagram - which suggested he had a fascination with cannibalism and sexual domination.

The storm led to Armie quitting action comedy Shotgun Wedding, which he was set to shoot with Jennifer Lopez, citing “spurious online attacks against me”.

The messages are allegedly from the screen star to an ex-girlfriend. They said he wanted to cut off her toe and carry it around in his pocket.

They went on to tell the unnamed woman: “I am 100 per cent a cannibal. I want to eat you,” and: “I need to drink your blood.”

The writer, describing himself as “Your Master”, allegedly said he wanted the woman to be his slave and to be his until she died.

The actor has branded the allegations “bull***t claims”.

The messages were leaked by an anonymous woman from an Instagram account named House of Effie, which has shared photos and voice messages alleged to be of Armie.

She has said other women have come forward to tell her of affairs allegedly with Armie “with some ending up in the ER (A&E).”

‘She tried to stab me'

Dirty Sexy Money actress Bella Thorne defended the actor at the time, branding the screenshots of the messages “fake”.

The 23-year-old former Disney star wrote on Instagram: “Leave him and his family alone. No way he’s a freaking CANNIBAL.”

In the past, Armie has told of a girlfriend trying to stab him with a knife during sex and boasted that he liked grabbing women’s necks.

Those two incidents happened before he married US TV personality Elizabeth Chambers, the mother of his two children, in 2010.

His successful film career began with a standout role as twin entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss in The Social Network a decade ago.

Since then he has received a Golden Globe nomination for 2017’s Call Me By Your Name, played spy Illya Kuryakin in Guy Ritchie’s The Man From UNCLE in 2015 and was Felicity Jones’s co-star in 2018 legal drama On The Basis Of Sex.

But rifts in his marriage appeared after he made last year’s Netflix movie Rebecca.

The film featured some passionate love scenes — and there were rumours he and co-star Lily James were close on the set.

Shooting began in June 2019 and Armie announced his divorce in July 2020. The split was followed by one romance after another.

Last September he was seen on a date with Bruce Willis’s daughter Rumer, 32, who recently posted images of herself in leather bondage-themed poses.

The same month he stepped out with Jessica Ciencin Henriquez, 30, ex-wife of American Psycho actor Josh Lucas. And in December Armie hooked up with model Paige Lorenze, 22. It is US writer Jessica who has added fuel to the fire around the “domination” text messages.

She claimed on Twitter that they are “real” and later added on Instagram: “It takes an army to hide a predator.

“Behind every abuser is a team of people working hard to cover up the trail.”

The messages are genuinely disturbing in places. One states: “You just live to obey and be my slave. I will own you. That’s my soul. My brain. My spirit. My body.”

Another says: “Would you come and be my property till you die? If I wanted to cut off one of your toes and keep it with me in my pocket so I always had a piece of you in my possession?”

The actor has admitted going to extremes with dominant behaviour in the bedroom.

Talking about the period before he got married, he told Playboy magazine: “I liked grabbing the neck and the hair and all that.”

Seven years ago he told Elle magazine how a woman tried to slice him during a moment of extreme passion.

He said: “She was like, ‘True love leaves scars. You don’t have any’. “And then she tried to stab me with a butcher knife. Of course, I promptly broke up with her — seven months later.”

Californian-born Armie described his upbringing as “wholesome”.

His wealthy father, Michael, owned several businesses, including a film and television production company.

His great-grandfather was the multi-millionaire oil magnate Armand Hammer, who in 1976 was convicted of illegally donating large sums to US President Richard Nixon’s re-election campaign.

When he was seven his family moved to the idyllic Cayman Islands, where he lived for the next five years and received a private education.

On his return to California he started to rebel against his cosseted existence.

‘I was a bad criminal’

After starting a fire, he was thrown out of the Christian school he attended in Los Angeles.

Armie confessed: “I felt caged. I poured lighter fluid outside the school and set it on fire.

“I was a bad criminal, because I wrote my name with the fluid, so they knew who had done it.”

Against his family’s wishes he dropped out of school to become an actor — and decided to push life’s boundaries.

He said: “I’d grown up in a household of so much love and so much good. Once I was on my own, I was like, ‘Let’s see how hot this candle can burn’.”

Armie settled down at 23, marrying Elizabeth. He later said he realised the value of a loving relationship and no longer wanted to be dominant in the bedroom.

The break-up of their marriage last year had a massive impact, and Armie sought therapy.

He was particularly upset about not being able to see his daughter Harper, six, and son Ford, three, for months during the pandemic.

Elizabeth had decided to stay in the Cayman Islands with their children, rather than risk returning to California, where Covid-19 infection rates are much higher.

Armie was reunited with his kids in the Caribbean islands after two weeks in quarantine. They are now trying to settle access arrangements in what could be a difficult divorce.

When they announced their split, Armie said: “Our children and relationship as co-parents and dear friends will remain our priority.”

Those anonymous “cannibal” screen grabs will not have helped Armie’s attempts to regain some normality with his family.

A source close to Elizabeth said she was shocked by the “messages”. She has told a friend she “believed” the women who claim to have received them, and said she was “shocked and saddened” by the BDSM and rape fantasies.

Armie is an actor who has liked to leave his comfort zone both on and off the screen.

One of his first roles was kissing Leonardo DiCaprio in the 2011 movie J Edgar. And his best-known part was playing a gay older lover in Call Me By Your Name. Becoming someone different is something he excels at.

How much the “cannibal” text messages are fantasy play-acting and how much they reveal about his true intentions are unclear.

As he once told a journalist: “I find myself at parties convincing people of the most heinously bullt things, just to get them to believe me.”

Announcing he was pulling out of filming on Shotgun Wedding earlier this year, the actor said: “I’m not responding to these bull***t claims.

The former Sierra Leone national team player also trapped another woman in a Bristol nightclub toilet and attempted to rape her in 2019.

Sesay, who also played Bristol City, was arrested after she managed to escape his grip and raise the alarm.

And the former goalkeeper has today been given a ten-year jail term for the offences.

Sesay was convicted of one count of rape and two of attempted rape against two separate women.

The 22-year-old was also found not guilty of a second charge of rape following a trial at Bristol Crown Court.

He joined the Bristol City academy in 2017 - and went on to make multiple loan moves to non-league clubs before eventually being released.

At the sentencing hearing today, His Honour Judge Cullum told Sesay he was a rapist and a ""sexual predator.""

FOOTIE RAPIST

He said he used ""a veneer of charm and flirtatious behaviour"" to put himself close to women who he perceived to be targets.

He said his actions had significantly affected both victims, with one suffering severe psychological harm.

Sesay was arrested on July 11, 2019 following an incident at Mbargo nightclub, on The Triangle, Bristol, after he trapped a woman in a toilet cubicle and attempted to rape her.

CCTV footage shows Sesay walking into the toilets in the nightclub - before turning around to look at the camera.

The victim managed to break free and get help from her friends and door staff, resulting in Sesay being detained and arrested at the scene.

At his trial, the court heard how Sesay also followed a woman into the toilets and forced his way into a cubicle at the Hart Lounge in Southgate, London - where he carried out an attack in which he committed rape and attempted rape.

Sesay, of Plumstead, London, was charged in connection with the offences in Bristol and London in August 2020.

The shadow Cabinet minister spoke out as a Whitehall probe was launched into Britain's elite schools amid fears of a 'rape culture'.

6 Labour shadow Cabinet minister Jess Phillips has admitted she would hand her own son in to the police if she suspected him of carrying out a sexual assault

More than 10,000 reports posted by pupils on a website have exposed the harrowing scale of misogyny, harassment and sexual assault in some schools.

At least 100 schools were named on the the Everyone's Invited site, which was set up by former private-school pupil Soma Sara, 22, to expose 'rape culture' in schools.

Ms Phillips blasted the government for leaving parents ""totally rudderless"" and said parents should hand in their own children if they suspect them of crimes.

The shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding told Times Radio: ""If it is as wide-scale as this website is making clear then there are boys in schools - and it is largely boys - that (parents) need to intervene, including taking their son to the police station.

'RAPE CULTURE' EXPOSED

""If I thought my son, and how I would find out about this I don't know, then, yes, that is absolutely what I would suggest my son should do.""

Schools named on Everyone's Invited include Eton College, St Paul's School, Dulwich College, Westminster School and Highgate School.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has branded the allegations as ""shocking and abhorrent"" amid calls for an inquiry by watchdog Ofsted.

Ms Phillips said: ""I have a 16-year-old son and a 12-year-old son and today I will send them to their local state secondary school and I've been speaking to them about this.

""The reality is that schools, the Government and parents have to look at what is happening over the last couple of weeks, and, in fact many, many years, and look at what they could be doing to make this better.""

Meanwhile, police officers are ramping up efforts to crack down on gender-based violence after thousands of online testimonies revealed a 'rape culture '.

Simon Bailey, who leads the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) on child protection, said he had received ""in excess of 7,000"" reports from people online.

Mr Bailey said the growing school sex scandal has been fuelled by online porn and the sexualisation of women.

Asked how parents should be responding, he told the Today programme: ""If parents are aware that their son or their daughter has been a victim of abuse, please come forward and report the abuse.

""Your son or daughter, their account will be believed and we will deal with it appropriately.

""If as a parent you are aware your son has been responsible for a sexual assault then I think you should again be taking your son to the police and saying, 'look I've now become aware that this is what my son has done''.

But Mr Bailey does not believe the issue is ""exclusive only to private schools"".

When it was put to him if he had concerns that schools had covered up allegations for reputational reasons, Mr Bailey said: ""I don't have any evidence for that at the moment, but I think it's a reasonable assumption.

""It's predictable and it's a reasonable assumption that in some cases, and hopefully it's just a few, but in some cases schools will have made the decision just to deal with the allegations internally, rather than reporting them when they actually should have done.""

He also warned on the website Everyone's Invited, that ""a culture has grown over recent years whereby in the minds of some people it is acceptable to treat young women in particular in a manner that we are now seeing"".

if anything is making you feel frightened or so uncomfortable and upset that you’re adjusting your daily life to avoid it, then let us know. Louisa Rolfe

Describing the scale of the investigation, he said: ""I believe that in excess of 7,000 people have now put testimonies up online and there are lots and lots of victims that will now be thinking about what has happened to them and having conversations with their parents and others about what to do next.""

A Whitehall investigation has been launched into the emerging scandal, with officials from the Department of Education and Home Office leading the response alongside police chiefs and Ofsted.

Government advice on sexual harassment and sexual violence between kids in schools and colleges is also now being revised - and will be in force by the beginning of the next academic year, the Telegraph reports.

Asked about the Prime Minister's thoughts on claims there is a ""rape culture"" in some schools, the PM's official spokesman said: ""We want victims to have the confidence to report crimes and be comforted in knowing that everything will be done to bring offenders to justice.

""Given these allegations, a police helpline will be set up in due course to ensure victims can access advice and support where needed and DfE and the Home Office and the NPCC are in contact, with everyone invited to provide support to those who are reporting abuse and to provide advice on contacting the police if they wish.""

'WE WANT TO KNOW'

It comes as a Scotland Yard chief urged women who are made to feel “uncomfortable” by wolf-whistling and other forms of harassment to report matters to police.

Louisa Rolfe, an assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan police, promised to take all incidents “seriously”, even if they did not constitute a crime.

“I would urge them to report to us,” she said.

“We do take them seriously. While every incident might not have a criminal justice outcome, we want to know about patterns of offending.

“If you said to somebody about wolf-whistling [that they should] report it to police, they might think that’s strange.

""But, actually, if anything is making you feel frightened or so uncomfortable and upset that you’re adjusting your daily life to avoid it, then let us know.”

Rolfe, who leads the force’s strategy on violence against women and girls, made her comments as the force braces itself for criticism from the police watchdog over its handling of the Everard vigil at Clapham Common, south London, on March 13, The Times reports.

She admitted that the recent murder of Sarah Everard and the Met’s heavy-handed tactics at a vigil to mourn her death had resulted in the need to “build confidence” and trust between women and the police.

Hundreds of people also gathered outside a nearby police station with police firing teargas and flash bangs to disperse the mob.

By around midnight local time, the National Guard was on the scene and Brooklyn Center mayor Mike Elliott imposed a curfew from 1 am this morning until 6 am.

He tweeted: ""We want to make sure everyone is safe,"" the mayor tweeted. ""Please be safe and please go home.""

Earlier Wright’s sobbing mother Katie told a crowd he called her to say he had been pulled over by police because of air freshener that was dangling from his rear view mirror.

She said she heard officers tell her son to put his phone down, and then one of the officers ended the call.

Soon after, her son's girlfriend told her he had been shot.

She told reporters: ""All he did was have air fresheners in the car and they told him to get out of the car.

""He got out of the car and his girlfriend said they shot him.

""He got back in the car and drove away and crashed and now he was dead on the ground since 1.47.

""Nobody will tell us anything and nobody will talk to her.

""I asked them to please take my son off the ground — he’s been there since 1.47 this afternoon.""

All he did was have air fresheners in the car and they told him to get out of the car Daunte Wright's mother

Tensions were already high in Minneapolis and the surrounding area as the murder trial of Derek Chauvin, the white former officer who knelt on the neck of Floyd is set to continue into its third week today.

The killing of Floyd last August sparked riots across the United States and bolstered the Black Lives Matter movement.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said it was ""investigating an officer-involved shooting incident"" in Brooklyn Center but declined to identify the victim.

According to a statement from the Brooklyn Center Police Department, officers pulled over a driver for a traffic violation.

When they discovered he had an outstanding warrant, they tried to take him into custody.

He got back into his car, and one of the officers shot him dead.

A female passenger in the car suffered ""non-life-threatening injuries"" and was transported to a local hospital, said the statement, which did not identify the woman.

Photos from the protest showed men stomping on the windshield of a police cruiser.

Police fired rubber bullets to try to disperse the protesters, according to the Star Tribune.

After about an hour, the police presence eased, and the crowd lit candles and wrote messages such as ""Justice for Daunte Wright"" in chalk on the street.

But clashes broke out again soon after as another group of several hundred protesters gathered outside the Brooklyn Center Police Headquarters and were met with teargas and flashbangs.

Speaking at a press conference, John Harrington, the state's commissioner of public safety, reported ""rocks and other objects thrown at the police department"".

He added that officers were sent to the scene and the crowd had mostly dispersed.

About 20 businesses were looted at a local mall, he said.

Meanwhile, police said there was violence elsewhere with a police officer hit by a vehicle near 26xx Central Avenue North East. They are reportedly lightly injured.

Cops also reported someone ramming the barrier at the police vehicle impound lot in a bid for others to take their cars back.

Mr Harrington said more National Guard troops would be moved into the area on Monday, to deal with potential unrest.

The shooting comes during the ongoing trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin, who is facing charges of manslaughter and murder over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last May.

Floyd's killing sparked months of protests in the United States against racism and police brutality and attracted international outrage.

Mayor Elliott called the shooting ""tragic"", while Minnesota governor Tim Walz said the state ""mourns another life of a Black man taken by law enforcement.""

Over the next two years he raped her on numerous occasions, including on his own wedding night.

The victim escaped his clutches when she turned 15 and moved to a different part of the UK.

But in 2012 Guzikowski was back in contact with the victim and he continued his abuse.

The victim finally plucked up the courage to contact police in 2019 and Guzikowski was arrested.

On Wednesday, Guzikowski was jailed for 30 years after he was found guilty of eight counts of rape following a trial at Nottingham Crown Court.

The court heard Guzikowski had previously been jailed for four-and-a-half years for sexual offences committed against children and adults.

Detective Chief Inspector Clare Dean, of Nottinghamshire Police's Public Protection team, said: ""Guzikowski is a dangerous sexual predator.

The prisoners - who gang raped a 15-year-old girl in 2012 - will now be put to death under the hastily drafted law.

3 Bangladesh now has the death penalty as punishment for rapists Credit: Alamy Live News

The sentence was given by a special tribunal in the northern district of Tangail, which was set up to deal with cases of abuse against women and children.

Prosecutor Nasim Ahmed said the rape victim's boyfriend took her to a riverside where she was raped by him and two friends.

Two other men then joined in the vile attack.

Ahmed told reporters: ""All five were found guilty and have been sentenced to death.""

They are the first to be sentenced to hang since the government introduced the death penalty for rape earlier this week.

Until the new punishment was introduced, the harshest penalty for a single rape offender was life imprisonment.

Ministers rushed through a new law in days - while parliament was not sitting - amid nationwide outrage at video of a woman being tortured and raped by eight men.

Last week, demonstrations broke out across the country after harrowing footage of a group of men stripping and attacking the woman went viral on social media.

DEATH PENALTY

Anger over the issue of rape has been simmering since last month - when members of the ruling party's student wing, Bangladesh Chhatra League, were arrested and charged in a separate gang rape case.

Protesters in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country have demanded harsher punishments and faster trials for perpetrators of sex crimes.

According to activists in Bangladesh, just three per cent of rape cases end in convictions.

Now if convicted, rapists can be punished by the death penalty, because of the country's cabinet decision.

Ain-o-Salish Kendra, a women's rights group, said 889 rapes, including hundreds of gang rapes, occurred between January and August this year.

Despite the harsher punishment, some have said that this won't stop violence against women - but will instead increase it.

The 41-year-old was arrested in Austin on Monday morning in connection with the shooting death of Amanda, his daughter Alyssa, and her boyfriend Willie Simmons.

He allegedly carried out the deadly triple shooting months after Amanda had taken out a restraining order against him when he was arrested on the child sexual assault charges.

She had also filed for divorce after his arrest.

Amanda allegedly feared that he would cause harm to her and her children after he was released on bail.

Broderick was arrested last June and imprisoned for 16 days.

He was charged with sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl reported to be a member of his family.

On his release on June 22, 2020, Broderick was fitted with a GPS tracking device and ordered not to go within 200ft of the child.

He was also reportedly hit with no-contact and distancing stipulations to keep him away from the family.

Yet just a month after his release, Travis County prosecutors alleged that he had violated the terms of the emergency protective order in the child sexual assault case.

The Austin-American Statesman reports that Broderick had allegedly emailed a person understook to be the woman involved in the case and accused her of a ""cash grab.""

Prosecutors alleged that he also attached images of her undressed and engaged in sexual acts in the email.

The woman involved in the case was identified by the New York Post as Broderick's estranged wife.

At the time, State District Judge Karen Sage agreed to raise Broderick's bond to $75,000.

Yet she later sided with Broderick's legal team when they petitioned to have the GPS tracking device removed.

The judge has since said that it was standard practice as over 142 days, Broderick had not broken the distancing terms set out on his release

According to the Daily Beast, Broderick also spent time in misogynistic message boards online and posted comments about not getting married or having children.

The Daily Beast linked the suspect to usernames “slammedcavi” and “slammedcavi254,” which spent time on the r/seduction subreddit and showed an interested in anti-feminist figure Coach Greg Adams.

A t-shirt reading “The Future Is Still Male"" is among the products sold by Adams on an Etsy shop the usernames visited.

The Daily Beast reports that one of the usernames they linked to Broderick commented “get divorced, get f****d by the court” when asked for the male equivalent to the phrase ""happy wife, happy life.""

“Don’t forget to pull out,” the username wrote in answer to the question “a simple tip that could save someone’s life.”

The username also praised comments such as “She got a hole, ain’t she? A heartbeat?” when describing a woman’s attractiveness.

And applauded comments recommending intense and continuous eye contact to pick up women.

The names of the three victims of Sunday's shooting emerged as a man hunt was underway for Broderick and the public was warned that he could be ""dangerous.""

It has since emerged that his family had tried to keep him away after his release and had told authorities that they feared him.

""I'm afraid he will try to hurt me or [the] children, because these allegations have come out and he may lose his career,"" his wife said while filing for a protective order, according to court documents.

""Stephen has prior military experience and is SWAT trained. If he wanted to hurt someone, he would know how.""

His daughter Alyssa also said that she felt unsafe, the Post reports.

“I felt safe after my dad had been arrested and he was in jail, but now that he’s out I don’t feel safe,” she wrote.

“I’m afraid that to him, a protective order will be just a piece of paper. I’m worried that he’ll come after my family and try to take my brother. I’m afraid that he might hurt me or my mom for coming forward,” the teen added.

The French bulldogs were found safe on Friday after they were stolen by armed thieves who shot and injured Ryan Fischer in Los Angeles.

An unnamed woman brought beloved pups Koji and Gustav to an LAPD station just after 6pm - two days after the horror shooting.

Detectives and a representative for the singer went to the Olympic Community Police Station - which is just over six miles from the scene of the robbery - and confirmed the identity of the unharmed dogs.

Gaga, 34, is currently filming a movie in Rome.

Fischer, 30, was shot and struck down by dognappers on Wednesday night while walking the singers pooches in West Hollywood.

Her dad Joe Germanotta father said he's confident cops will locate the two suspects, described by cops as two Black males estimated to be between 20-25 years old.

""I want them apprehended so that they are tried for assault and/or attempted murder,"" he told Fox News..

""I am relieved that Ryan is going to be OK and Koji and Gusatv were found. Thanks to the LAPD.

""Letting Koji and Gustav go unharmed was nice but they must be punished for what they did to Ryan.

""Special thanks to the doctors and nurses in the emergency room.""

Meanwhile, the mystery woman who dropped off the dogs appeared to be ""uninvolved and unassociated"" with the Wednesday night attack, LAPD Cpt John Tippett said.

It was unclear how the woman obtained the dogs or if she would be in line for the $500,000 reward offered by Gaga this week for their safe return.

""Both of Lady Gaga’s dogs have been turned in to a local police station, and they have been safely reunited with Lady Gaga representatives,"" tweeted the LAPD.

Earlier Friday, Lady Gaga broke her silence to praise Fischer as a ""hero"".

The singer also begged for the safe return of her dogs and repeated her half-million-dollar reward to get them back.

She shared a few photos of her two missing pets and wrote: “My beloved dogs Koji and Gustav were taken in Hollywood two nights ago.

""My heart is sick and I am praying my family will be whole again with an act of kindness.

“I will pay $500,000 for their safe return. Email KojiandGustav@gmail.com to contact us.""

Gaga added: “Or, if you bought or found them unknowingly, the reward is the same.

“I continue to love you Ryan Fischer, you risked your life to fight for our family. You’re forever a hero.”

He was taken to the hospital in a ""grave"" condition and is expected to survive his injuries.

Gaga is reportedly speaking with him, and he is now breathing on his own after being shot in the chest.

Shocking surveillance footage from the scene showed a man believed to be Fischer strolling down the street with her three pets, before a white car pulls up beside him.

Two men then appear to get out of the vehicle and run toward the man, who begins crying out for help.

The Sun exclusively revealed that a hero neighbor kept Ryan alive by tending to him after the shooting before cops arrived.

Buck Angel, who lives in front of the spot where Ryan was gunned down, told The Sun: ""I heard screaming, which we hear a lot in this neighborhood, but it wasn’t stopping.

""I got up and looked right over my fence and saw a car.

The actress had previously talked about how therapy was able to help her remember all of the repressed memories from her childhood.

In an intimate chat with psychiatrist and brain disorder specialist, Dr. Amen, the 33-year-old opened up about her recent diagnosis and how she's working to break the stigma around it.

She explained that her rape at 18 years old at a friend's apartment ""triggered the memories of the child sexual abuse.""

The star said: ""I don't have anything until around five, and then from five to 11, I recount incidents throughout and then when I was 13, I have one singled-out memory of this one thing that I don't have a sense of anything else but that.""

The Nip/Tuck actress then revealed that she feels no shame about her DID diagnosis and her past, which is what's helping her try to overcome her traumas.

Dissociative identity disorder (DID), previously known as multiple personality disorder (MPD), is a mental disorder characterized by the maintenance of at least two distinct and relatively enduring personality states. The disorder is accompanied by memory gaps beyond what would be explained by ordinary forgetfulness.

AnnaLynne recounted that before her remembering all of the childhood trauma in 2019, she would have ""definitive splits"" in her personality, which ultimately helped her as an actress.

She began: ""All of my roles were splits, but I didn't even realize I was doing it at all until I did a project while on 90210.

9 AnnaLynne has no shame about her diagnosis Credit: Getty

""During year three, my hiatus, I did a film [Exilion] where I played a very cerebral, disturbed, strange girl, that was very close to how I feel inside.

""And it was very exposing, confronting, and a little bit traumatic without realizing and even healing as well.""

She further talked about how after doing that film, she was meant to show up on the set of 90210 the next day and she couldn't channel her character of Naomi Clark because she had become her Exilion character.

AnnaLynne continued: ""I spent a lot of my life as the split I was on at 13 and on. She was a balls to the wall, middle fingers to sky, anarchist from hell, who will stab you with the spiked ring she wears and you will like it.

""She was a nasty, little creature but I have so much attitude for her because she got me out of the hell I was in.""

AnnaLynne further revealed she was misdiagnosed in 2017 as bipolar.

Her DID diagnosis comes just two years after she opened up about discovering she had repressed most of her childhood memories.

AnnaLynn talked about how one month after her 31st birthday, she went to therapy with the goal of ending the disassociation she felt due to her traumatic upbringing.

She told Us Weekly: ""I told my doctor, 'I’ve fixed myself from my neck to my head.'

""I changed my mindset. I’ve found forgiveness and love.' But I still had cycles in my life where I’d pull in negative energy and bad sexual experiences.""

And she didn't know where these bouts of sadness and anger were coming from.

She further opened up about how eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy (EMDR) helped her remember she was sexually abused up until she was 11 years old.

She told the outlet that when she started therapy, her head jerked to the left repeatedly and she saw herself naked.

She said that EMDR made her see herself being sexually abused at a young age and that the abuse ""went on for years.""

AnnaLynne further explained: ""If I’m hoping to heal from violent energy, I can’t do that by responding with more violent or angry energy.

She has also explained that to her, sex and love meant the same thing. And it was all due to the abuse.""

She added: ""Sex and love equaled the same thing. So what did I do? I wanted to be loved.

""I thought I had to had sex with someone to be able to be loved. It was devastating to my soul as a human being to feel I wasn’t worthy of love unless someone was taking advantage of my body.""

AnnaLynne is now the president of Together1Heart, which aims to end sex trafficking and create a safe space for those who've been through the terrible experience.

She also used her experience to help her portray Naomi Clark, who was assaulted by a teacher, in 90210.

In the show (and in real life), her character is criticized because she's supposedly in love with the teacher, to which she says that she's not in love, but that he raped her.

She disclosed to her costars she had been assaulted and that's why she was in hysterics while filming the scene.

Paige Poole, 28, and married dad Ross Kingsland, 44, were jailed for a total of 24 years yesterday.

Kingsland was caught by undercover police carrying out a child sexual abuse investigation.

Poole then came forward to say she was his lover and the true horror of their crimes was revealed.

Caging the evil pair at Exeter Crown Court, Judge David Evans said: ""Each chose the path they took together.

""Each chose to plan and enact their deviant desires - a true meeting of wicked minds.They each derived sexual gratification from it.""

'MORALLY CORRUPT'

The judge said Kingsland was a ""morally corrupt paedophile and a willing offender from the off"" adding: ""It is a great misfortune you found each other.""

Businessman Kingsland admitted 12 sex offences against children and was sentenced to 11 years.

Poole, who carried out the abuse on the 18-month-old girl up to eight times, was jailed for 13 years for the ""multiple abhorrent offences"".

She admitted 20 sex offences against children.

Each chose to plan and enact their deviant desires - a true meeting of wicked minds Judge David Evans

They had also met and conspired to rape another toddler but the prosecution was unable to say whether this happened, which had left the victim's family in ""anguish"".

They were caught after a Met Police officer posed as a mother of two daughters aged eight and 12, offering them up for sexual abuse after making contacting on a site called 'They Grow Up So Fast'.

Kingsland called himself Dirty Dad and communicated with the 'mother' to meet up to sexually abuse the young sisters.

He also sent the mother a video file of a five-year-old he said he had abused, the court was told.

EVIL PAIR

Last July, police arrested Kingsland at his home in Exeter - and the next day Poole, an American woman living in London, visited his wife to say she was his girlfriend.

When police forensically examined their mobile phones, the full horror of the sexual abuse was revealed.

Poole was arrested in Staffordshire, where a second phone was found hidden after she wiped traces of her activities on other devices.

The court was told that Poole made a series of sickening videos of herself abusing an 18-month-old girl - naked and laughing as she made them.

'DARK PATH'

Kingsland called her the Dark Angel and used black heart emojis and the sign of the devil.

He told her they were both ""on the same dark path"".

The families of the victims made emotional statements to the court.

One described it saying ""it seems like a nightmare"" and described Kingsland as an ""evil, sick manipulative person"".

Following the murder, Crystal's mother Belinda Lane embarked on a decade-long hunt for justice in which she manoeuvred through corners of social media in a bid to find those responsible for her daughter's death.

Who was Crystal Theobald?

Crystal Theobald was a 24-year-old mother of two, killed in February 2006.

Despite the fact that her death was a tragic consequence of gang violence, Theobald herself was not actually in any kind of gang.

She left behind two daughters and her boyfriend, who was also wounded in the attack.

How did Crystal Theobald die?

Theobald was gunned down by gang members after her car was approached in Arlanza, a neighbourhood in California.

Her vehicle was peppered with bullets from the gang as a form of retaliation after their car was shot at earlier in the day.

It later emerged that Theobald nor anyone else present in the car at the time was involved with gangs.

The 24-year-old was killed after being shot in the head.

Why was Crystal Theobald Killed?

It remains unclear whether the murder was a case of mistaken identity, a possibility given the confusion surrounding a notorious gang unloading on what were innocent civilians with no ties to other gangs or organised crime.

Tragically, Theobald’s mother Belinda was in a car directly behind the one her daughter was in, and witnessed the horrors unfold.

Belinda sparked a one-woman mission to track down every single culprit, even using information sourced from the now defunct social media platform MySpace.

Who is William Sotelo?

As of January 2020, William Sotelo became the last remaining member of the gang behind Theobald's murder to face prison charges.

Sotelo, now 31, was the driver of the SUV that the attack was committed from.

Just before his trial began, he reached an agreement with the prosecution that meant the convict would plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter along with gang and firearm allegations.

Originally, Sotelo was facing daunting charges that included first-degree murder, but as part of the deal with the prosecution that charge was eventually dropped.

Where is William Sotelo now?

On January 23rd 2020, William Sotelo was sentenced to 22 years in prison for his role in the murder of Crystal Theobald.

The climax of what was a dramatic trial saw Theobald's mother Belinda use her chance via her victim impact statement to unleash a fierce tirade at Sotelo, who sat in silence as he stared at the walls of the courtroom.

The distraught mother's speech lasted just over a quarter of an hour as she lambasted the guilty party, dubbing him a “coward,” a “monster,” a “punk,” and “despicable” before telling Sotelo how she hoped that other gang member inmates “snuff your life out” while he see's out his sentence.

Belinda Lane went one further and began to spew insults at Sotelo's family, accusing them of helping the criminal hide when he first fled back to Mexico.

At this point, the judge was forced to intervene to remind her that she was permitted to address Sotelo or the judge only.

In what was a powerful tribute, the entirety of Belinda's speech was read in front of a large portrait of her late daughter, held up by Riverside County District Attorney’s Victims Services team.

When is the film available on Netflix?

The woman was found injured in the early hours of yesterday morning and pronounced dead at the scene.

A man, who is from Leicester, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in police custody, police said.

Residents last night told of their shock after her body was found lying in the street.

In a statement last night, the force said: ""Officers were called by a member of the public to the area at 2.25am after a 29-year-old woman was found injured lying on the pavement in the street.

""Police and East Midlands Ambulance Service attended. Sadly the woman was pronounced dead at the scene.""

The area remains cordoned off while cops probe the area, including making CCTV checks and speaking to residents.

The woman was found in Uppingham Close, a cul-de-sac off Uppingham Road.

A pensioner, who did not wish be named, who lives opposite the spot where the tragic 29-year-old was discovered, told the Sun: “It’s a terrible thing to happen and out hearts go out to the poor girl’s family.

""I’ve lived here for many years, it’s a nice safe area and nothing bad ever happens here. There’s never any trouble and we’re all in a state of disbelief.”

She added: “The first we knew about the murder was when police came knocking on our door. They’ve been here all day making inquiries and carrying out forensics examination. It's right across from my front door.

""We don’t know who she is and don’t believe she lives in the street but it’s an unusual place to be and it’s not a short cut to anywhere. There is a foot path leading from the main road.”

Another householder said: ""Police have been making door to door enquiries and told everyone to stay in their homes. One man was taking his wheelie bin outside but was asked to go back inside.

“It’s shocking and we’re just relieved that a suspect has been arrested.”

Detective Inspector Jenni Heggs, of the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, is leading the investigation.

She said: “We are carrying out inquiries to establish the full circumstances of this incident and how a young woman has lost her life.

""Officers remain with the family of the woman providing full support as our investigation continues.

“Following initial inquiries, we have arrested a man on suspicion of murder.

""However, we still continue to appeal to anyone with any information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, to make contact with us.

“We are urging anyone who was in Uppingham Close or the surrounding areas between 5pm yesterday and 2.25am today to think back to anything you saw or heard which could assist our inquiries.

https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14539057/end-rape-culture-ban-internet-porn/,2021-04-03 21:00:11+00:00,We can’t end ‘rape culture’ until we ban internet porn,"BOYS born this century are the first to grow up consuming a diet of internet porn and I suggest it is poisoning them.

Every boy? No, and those of us with our own sons will look at those sweet, sensitive lads and see no connection between them and the boys being exposed on the Everyone’s Invited website — all those spiteful creeps who have subjected thousands of teenage girls to every kind of sexual abuse imaginable.

6 We can’t end ‘rape culture’ until we ban internet porn Credit: Getty

But let’s not kid ourselves. Internet porn has had a catastrophic impact.

It has produced far too many damaged boys who believe that unspeakable cruelty to girls is cool, normal and expected, that humiliating girls confers status.

The Everyone’s Invited website has collected more than 13,000 personal testimonies from girls — and the victims are almost always girls — who have been subjected to abuse at the hands of boys their own age, from groping to sexual assault all the way up to rape.

“Rape culture exists when thoughts, behaviours and attitudes in a society or environment have the effect of normalising and trivialising sexual violence,” says the home page of Everyone’s Invited.

The term “rape culture” sounds horribly emotive. The idea that sexual abuse of girls is now standard behaviour in our schools seems scarcely credible.

But then you read the testimonies on Everyone’s Invited.

And then you talk to your own teenage daughter.

Rape culture is not hyperbole. Rape culture is a brutal statement of fact about the toxic culture of misogyny that now runs rampant.

It points to a sickness in boys that did not exist in previous generations. Started by Soma Sara, 22, Everyone’s Invited has so far focused on abuse in many of the top private schools in the country.

But anyone who thinks rape culture is confined to fee-paying schools is deluding themselves.

Sexual violence cuts across all class borders.

If you were born before the millennium, then you did not grow up watching female debasement for light entertainment. But if you are a boy born this century, then you have almost certainly been bombarded with images of sexual violence. And it has done you damage.

Snogging behind the bike shed just doesn’t cut it any more.

Not if you have grown up watching vile sex acts.

Not if you think that sex requires women to be humiliated, beaten up and raped.

How does any boy consume this poison for years and then form healthy relationships?

At heart, teenage boys are no doubt pretty much the same as they always were — a cocktail of shyness and longing, all raging hormones and insecurities.

HORROR STORIES

The last thing any confused adolescent boy needs is to be endlessly told that degrading girls is the way to become a man. But that is where we are today.

And as the horror stories pile up, the shocked grown-ups cry that something must be done.

A new helpline for victims, an Ofsted inquiry, a police task force to investigate allegations, police officers going into schools to lecture boys about “consent.”

All noble gestures. And all of them are like putting a sticking plaster on a decapitation.

Boys are growing up being inundated with images of women being humiliated, degraded and abused.

What exactly did we think would happen?

Internet porn is the malignant tumour that needs to be cut out of our society. At the very least, it must be kept far away from teenage — and younger — boys.

Until that happens, our sons will be corrupted.

And our daughters will be made to suffer.

Amanda’s sitting pretty again as TV’s new Cilla

THIRTY years ago, a fresh-faced 19-year-old appeared on Blind Date.

“Hello, Cilla!” she beamed. “My name’s Amanda and I’m from London!”

The studio audience went wild at this first sighting of Amanda Holden. She talked of wanting to date Jack Nicholson (in his fifties even back then) and then teased a fellow contestant called Barnaby about his love handles. But the excitement was seeing a star being born. Now Amanda has been confirmed as the host of a new Blind Date-style show.

Finally getting Cilla’s job must be even better than a date with Jack Nicholson.

Unions’ lack of class

THE teaching unions were very voluble about keeping their members safe during these difficult days.

They are strangely more reticent about protecting the teacher at Batley Grammar School, who is currently in hiding after showing an image of the prophet Mohammed to a class during a discussion on blasphemy.

“He keeps breaking down crying and says that it’s all over for him,” says the teacher’s father. “He is worried that he and his family are all going to be killed.”

If ever a teacher needed support from his union, it is now.

Could the Corbynista comrades who run the teaching unions be any more gutless?

Joe so soft on China

THE floundering leaders of the free West are incapable of presenting a united front against Russia and China.

Desperate to avoid saving their people with the British Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, Merkel and Macron are grovelling before Putin for his Russian Sputnik V jab.

Meanwhile, President Joe Biden was weirdly restrained in his criticism of a Chinese regime that is eroding democracy in Hong Kong, rounding up the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang and ducking all responsibility for the greatest health emergency on the planet for over 100 years.

Drowsy Joe probably thinks that Mao Tse-Tung was not such a bad dude once you got to know him.

IF Labour lose the Hartlepool by-election to the Tories, will Sir Keir Starmer be avocado on toast?

We’re ready to fly

WILL we ever fly again? May 17 is pencilled in as the earliest date we will be allowed to resume foreign travel.

But suspicion lingers that the date will be pushed back further.

6 Life must begin again at some point Credit: Getty Images

Meaning another long, hot summer passes us by. But how much longer can we afford NOT to fly?

Around 250,000 people are directly employed by the aviation industry. It has an annual turnover of £60billion.

And for millions of us, foreign travel is one of life’s great joys.

The prospect of one day being free to travel is why we were so lockdown compliant for so long.

Business leaders and 40 MPs have united to urge Boris to allow us to dust off the cobwebs from our passports.

We are not a nation at the end of the Earth that can be locked away from the rest of the world for ever. We need to fly for our economic recovery. And for our sanity.

With over 31million vaccinated against coronavirus, stopping us from mingling with the rest of the world is starting to feel bonkers.

Life must begin again at some point.

It is true that the EU’s cock-up of vaccination renders much of Europe out of bounds.

But new research suggests there are still more than 130 countries we could safely visit, “without increasing pressure on the NHS”.

Until we get out our passports, we will still be waiting for Boris to deliver the Global Britain he keeps talking about.

SOME people should be locked down for ever. I am thinking of the selfish souls who left parks, beaches and beauty spots looking like rubbish tips.

Why is it so hard to pick up your own trash?

In Japan, primary school children spend 15 minutes at the end of the day using brooms, vacuums and cloths to spruce up their schools. And nobody litters in Japan.

I don’t suppose there’s much chance of getting British primary school children to clean their schools. But getting British adults to take home their crap doesn’t seem like very much to ask.

We are finally making it out of a health epidemic.

Only to see our country blighted by an epidemic of stupidity.

6 I almost fell for the Royal Mail parcel scam Credit: PA

THE two big scams doing the rounds are the recorded message informing you your National Insurance number has been blocked and the con telling you a Royal Mail parcel can’t be delivered until you fork out some cash. The National Insurance scam is easy to spot because the plummy old chap you hear sounds just like a resting actor.

But the Royal Mail scam fooled me, and I tried very hard to pay the phoney “outstanding fee”. The only thing that stopped me from getting scammed was that I tried to pay through the official Royal Mail website, where they had no idea what I was talking about.

Who are all these scammers?

Abdifatah Abdirahman Warsame and Abdishakur Mohamed Dige were both shot in the main square of Bossasso, on Somalia's north coast, for the brutal killing of Aisha Ilyes Aden.

2 Abdifatah Abdirahman Warsame and Abdishakur Mohamed Dige were shot in a town square

Aisha Ilyes Aden was abducted at a market in northern Puntland’s Galkayo town in February last year.

Her body was found the next morning near her home and she had been gang-raped, her genitals mutilated before being strangled to death.

Adeer Ilyas, the victim’s father witnessed the execution and said he was happy that justice had been served.

The brutal nature of the killing triggered public outrage and demonstrations, as well as an online protest using the hashtag JusticeForAisha.

Three men were convicted and sentenced to death in May last year and the decision was upheld by an appeal court in June.

OUTRAGE AT MURDER

“This is a clear indication that justice is served in Puntland,” said Puntland’s Justice Minister Awil Sheikh Hamid told a news conference.

“It is an alert for those who try to carry out crimes against women and girls.”

The execution of a third man, Abdirahman Warsame’s brother Abdisalam, was delayed for 10 days at the request of Aisha’s father, Adan Ilyas.

Somalia’s semi-autonomous Puntland region passed the country’s first law criminalising offences such as sexual harassment and rape in 2016.

Rape victims in the east African nation are stigmatised and forced to marry assailants.

Convictions under the law are rare, as police are either unaware of the law or do not see violence against women as a serious crime, say women’s rights campaigners.

Is Joe Exotic getting divorced?

It is believed that Joe Exotic is heartbroken over the breakup, his lawyer Francisco Hernandez told TMZ.

Exotic reportedly learned his relationship with the 25-year-old Dylan was over via a phone call to the prison where he is serving 22 years for plotting to kill his big cat rival Carole Baskin.

He wrote in an email to a friend that he felt ""abandoned and alone and just wanted to mean something to someone.""

Passage has said the decision wasn't easy and insisted there was no bad blood.

With his husband behind bars for the forseeable future, he said he would like to start dating again.

""In November of 2017 I met Joe who was there for me during a difficult time in my life,"" Passage wrote in a statement to Instagram.

""After just 9 short months he was arrested and, for the last two and a half years, we have been apart.

""I’ve always stood by his side and will continue to always love and support him.""

He added: ""I felt as if I had a microscope constantly looming over me which was and still is incredibly uncomfortable.

""This wasn’t an easy decision to make but Joe and I both understand that this situation isn’t fair to either of us. It’s something that neither of us were expecting but we are going to take it day by day.

""We are on good terms still and I hope it can stay that way. I will continue to have Joe in my life and do my best to support him while he undergoes further legal battles to better his situation.""

They were married in 2017, two months after the Netflix star's first husband, Travis Maldonado, shot himself in the head at Exotic's Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma.

Exotic has been married four times to other men - and it has been reported that he was married to a woman at one time.

He starred in the Netflix docuseries Tiger King, which explored big cat breeding and the eccentric characters that are involved in it.

Where is Joe Exotic now?

Joe Exotic is serving his sentence at a prison in Fort Worth, Texas.

He might not be released from custody until he is nearly 80 years old.

Exotic insists he is innocent and had requested a presidential pardon from Donald Trump before he left office.

An exoneration never came.

""I still maintain my innocence and look forward in the upcoming days to my attorneys filing my appeal and moving on to the next step in this nightmare,"" he said.

Pawel Relowicz, 26, bundled Libby, 21, into his car and drove her to a remote playing field after prowling the streets for a victim.

He then raped her before dumping her dead or dying in the freezing river Hull.

She was discovered six weeks later on March 20, 2019, in the Humber estuary by a fishing boat - a gold necklace bearing the letter 'L' still hanging around her neck.

Relowicz, who claimed he had consensual sex with Libby, was today convicted of rape and murder at Sheffield Crown Court after 27 hours and 55 minutes of deliberation.

The conviction comes just over two years after philosophy and religion student Libby vanished in Hull on February 1, 2019.

Speaking outside court, Libby's mum Lisa was supported by husband Russ as she read a devastating statement.

The nurse said: ""As a family, today's verdict changes nothing for us.

""There is no closure. We don't get to have Libby back.

""Our lives don't revert back to normal.

""However, we are pleased that all the hard work and dedication of the police and legal teams has been recognised.

""Libby will always be with us and we are all so proud of our beautiful, caring, wonderful girl.

""And, although she has been physically taken from us, the memories we have and the love we share will never be taken.""

Relowicz, who showed no emotion when the verdict was read out, was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing tomorrow.

During the trial, the court was told Relowicz was a convicted pervert who was described as a ""disgusting"" Peeping Tom who ""violated intimate moments"" by his own lawyer.

The fiend previously pleaded guilty to nine sexually motivated offences including voyeurism, outraging public decency and burglary.

He had exposed himself to women and performed sex acts on himself in the street in the year leading up to Libby's death.

Relowicz also watched them through their windows as they changed or had sex and swiped underwear and sex toys from women's homes as ""trophies"".

His last offence occurred just days before Libby went missing in 2019.

Sickeningly, the married dad-of-two admitted he had a ""fetish"" and was looking for ""easy sex"" on the night Libby vanished.

In a ""terrible twist of fate"", it was then he saw Libby - ""intercepting"" her as she walked the freezing streets of Hull moments from her home.

Libby's last movements January 31, 2019 Libby leaves her student home at Wellesley Avenue with friends at about 8.30pm and they walked to another student house on Cromer Street together The group leave at about 11pm to walk to The Welly nightclub, at the junction of Wellington Lane and Beverley Road, where they arrive at 11.20pm Libby is refused entry to the The Welly and is put in a taxi by her friends just before 11.30pm The taxi drops her in Wellesley Avenue but she does not go home. She instead walks towards Beverley Road where she falls over in the street Libby enters another house on Wellesley Avenue after the occupants heard her crying. She says she wants to go home but sets off towards Beverley Road, dropping her keys outside the house she left She is then approached by a woman who tried to help her outside the former convent at the Endsleigh Centre, on Beverley Road Two men try to help Libby as she lays in the snow near the junction of Haworth Road and Beverley Road. They were there from 11.40pm to 11.49pm Another woman steps in to help as she sits on the floor near a bus stop close to the same junction. A supermarket manager spots her in the same location Relowicz's Vauxhall Astra arrives at the end of Haworth Street at 11.57pm. The defendant gets out of the car, crosses the road to Beresford Avenue and tracks Libby as she walks back up Beverley Road February 1, 2019 They interact outside the Endsleigh Centre and entered the grounds before walking back to the car at the end of Haworth Street Relowicz drives off from Haworth Street at 12.08am with Libby in the car They arrive at Oak Road playing fields at 12.11am A man living in the house at the entrance to the playing fields wakes at 12.14am and ""after a period that he thought was a couple of minutes"" hears a woman screaming in the park. The man then sees a young man running from the park ""perhaps a few minutes after the last scream"" At 12.19am, CCTV captures Relowicz's indicators flashing as he unlocks his car Relowicz arrives home in Raglan Street at 12.23am He leaves home again at 2.22am and drives back to Oak Road playing fields, arriving at 2.25am. He stays for a little over four minutes Relowicz then drives around, arriving in Alexandra Road at 2.51am, walking over Newlands Avenue and performing a sex act in the street. He arrives back at Raglan Street but walks back to Newland Avenue where he is captured ""walking up and down the road in that area for no apparent reason and exhibiting some strange behaviour"" The prosecution say Relowicz raped and murdered Miss Squire at Oak Road playing fields after arriving at 12.11am. They say he put her dead or dying into the River Hull, which runs along the north east of the park. They say this could have been at the 12.11am visit or the later one at 2.25am. March 20, 2019 Libby's body is found in the Humber Estuary, off Spurn Point, by a fishing boat

The student had been drinking with friends and appeared ""in good spirits"" before the group headed to the nightclub in the city centre at around 11pm.

CCTV showed Libby stumbling with her pals as they walked through the snow to the club.

Once there, security staff on the door refused to let her in because she appeared to be drunk so she told her friends she would walk home instead.

But her pals put her in a taxi, which dropped Libby off close to her home, but tragically she ""walked away from the safety of her front door"".

Toxicology tests later revealed she was two-and-a-half times the drink-drive limit when she died.

She was later seen by passers-by ""obviously drunk"" and ""sobbing"" - including two men who spotted the student lying in the snow at the side of the road.

17 Libby is seen on CCTV walking to the nightclub

The bystanders tried to help her but were unable to understand what she was saying and she became verbally aggressive so they drove away.

A group of students who heard Libby crying outside their house let her in but she left, saying she wanted to go home.

She was likely hypothermic, ""extremely vulnerable"" and wasn't dressed for the weather as she stumbled through the snow-covered streets.

At this point, Relowicz was lurking in the shadows watching the student's final movements as he prepared to pounce.

He bundled Libby into his silver Vauxhall Astra and drove her to the secluded playing field where frantic screams were later heard.

Relowicz then left the playing field around seven-and-a-half minutes later without Libby.

Prosecutor Richard Wright QC said this was ""more than enough time"" for him to have ""taken or pursued Libby out into the playing fields, sexually attacked and killed her, put her body into the river, and then run back to his car.""

He said Relowicz's ""sole purpose"" was to ""silence her screams"" after he raped Libby.

The prosecutor added: ""Her screams, and the scratches that she clearly managed to land on the face of the defendant as she fought him off, are just part of the evidence that establishes that she was raped by a man whose entire motivation for coming into contact with her that night was to take her away from safety to a remote area well known to him and there to subject her to his uncontrollable sexual urges.

""His very purpose in prowling the streets was in order to commit opportunistic sexual offences and the rape of Libby was just such an offence.""

Relowicz later returned to the playing fields in the early hours of the morning.

17 Police search for the student after she vanished in 2019

CCTV footage captured him standing with his knees bent performing a sex act on himself in the street.

He had also visited a porn site twice in the hours after Libby died and had been ""in a state of heightened sexual arousal that night"".

Two days later, on February 3, a used condom containing DNA matching Relowicz was discovered in the area.

A huge search was mounted after Libby disappeared with cops searching ponds, bins and gardens in a desperate bid to find the student.

Her mum Lisa Squire told the court how she knew something was ""seriously wrong"" when her daughter first vanished.

Tragically, she had only dropped Libby back at Hull University just days before her brutal death.

17 Libby's mum Lisa said she knew something was 'seriously wrong'

The nurse, from High Wycombe, Bucks, said: ""I knew something wasn’t right and told her friend to call the taxi company, they had been to her favourite taxi companies and they had contacted the police.

""We made the decision not to panic and go straight to Hull as she could have gone to another friend’s house.

""I knew she had a lecture that day and would never miss a lecture so if she didn’t go to that something would be seriously wrong.

""We travelled to Hull and knew something serious had happened. It was not in her character and she was not answering her texts or calls.

""She was planning her future and was in the best place in her life she had ever been.""

As the frantic search gathered speed, Relowicz was arrested on suspicion of abduction in a huge breakthrough for the case.

But instead of helping police solve the riddle, the butcher instead created an intricate story to throw officers off the scent.

Painting himself as a caring hero, he claimed he ""just wanted to help"" when he saw crying Libby on the pavement.

He branded her a ""very beautiful woman"" but denied having any sexual feelings towards her.

17 Relowicz was caged for terrifying sex offences

Relowicz said: ""I asked her if everything was OK with her, she said yes and she asked me to hug her.

""We were hugging each other and we started kissing.""

He told jurors the pair had sex but Libby ""scratched"" his face when he didn't want to kiss her after so he drove away as she screamed at him not to leave her.

Relowicz said he then returned home where he had a bath and washed his clothes to stop his wife discovering he had sex with someone else.

After watching ""non-violent"" porn, he told the court he returned to the playing field as he was ""worried"" about Libby but couldn't see her.

The dad even said violent sexual intercourse, rape, rough sexual intercourse and the idea of causing pain in sex did not excite him sexually in a bizarre defence.

After he was arrested, police found a pink holdall containing ""trophies... taken in a series of sexually motivated burglaries"".

This included sex toys, photographs of young women and several pairs of women's knickers and thongs.

When quizzed by police, Relowicz said he ""forgot"" about them and they did not belong to him or his wife.

He also had two ""Halloween"" masks in the boot of his car - one described as a ""Scream"" mask and the other which had red hair.

But it wasn't until a month later that Libby's decomposed body washed up in the Humber Estuary.

A post mortem could not establish a cause of death but DNA matching Relowicz was found on her.

Her bruised body also had ""neck marks"" and small haemorrhages around her mouth, which could be evidence of asphyxia.

Relowicz was finally charged with Libby's rape and murder in October 2019 - two months after being jailed for eight years for his vile sex offences.

It can now be reported for the first time his sentence was reduced to five years and eight months at the Court of Appeal in March last year.

She added: “I cannot thank you enough my darling Pie for making me a mummy. For choosing me to be your mummy. It’s an honour, a privilege and a joy.

Brazilian Jeferson de Quadros Peres was sentenced to 52 years in prison for the murder of teenager Brenda da Rocha, after her mum, broke up with him and started a new relationship.

5 Jeferson de Quadros Peres was sentenced to 52 years for the teen's murder

5 Brenda da Rocha's body was found in a eucalyptus plantation

The girl's body was found in a eucalyptus plantation in September 2019 in the municipality of Passo de Torres, some 43 miles from her home in Maracaja.

An autopsy on the body revealed 40 stab wounds and over 60 blows in total.

Investigators concluded that Peres had killed her in a bid to take ""revenge"" on her mum who had ended their relationship and started seeing another man.

Peres even attended the teen's funeral and was only arrested three days after the crime, while he was in hospital following a suicide attempt.

A court in Santa Rosa do Sul found Peres guilty of the teen's death in February.

After the sentencing Allan Rocha Oliveira, the victim's 20-year-old brother told local media:

""A small part of the pain is eased. He hardly explained anything during the trial, saying he did not remember, just confessing to being the perpetrator.

He wrote on Twitter: ""Hang on a minute... I’m sure I was on this @dancingonice show? Was I? I’m sure I was?! Must’ve been a dream.""

Setting the jokey post aside, the former Coronation Street and Hollyoaks star then gave a more detailed account of his feelings and what the show meant to him.

""Kind of expected it but can't say that I'm not disappointed as I gave a hell of a lot to that show,"" said Chris. ""Coming 2nd with my partner Frankie in 2008 and then continuing to win two UK tours of the live show.""

He continued: ""I always tried to wow the audience with my routines, being the first celebrity to attempt an axel, lifts like the flambo, wraparound and helicopter, and my scratch spin, which even after 12 years has yet to be matched.

""...My routines don't have to be in the 'bet bits' show to remember what I achieved but it would have been nice to see them and reminisce!""

Chris was axed from Coronation Street in 2013 after The Sun exposed him as a masked rapper who had boasted of raping a woman in a sickening YouTube video under the guise of his alter-ego The Phantom.

He said the videos had been made a year before when he had been “experimenting” with music.

Her devastated family today paid tribute to the ""fiercely loyal"" mum-of-two as they urged anyone with information to come forward.

They said in a statement: ""There are no words to adequately describe the void left in our lives by the death of our mum.

""She was so much to so many people; a wife, mother, daughter, nanny, sister and a friend.

""Mum was fiercely loyal, she loved with her whole heart and nothing was too much trouble for the people she cared about.

What we know so far:

""She had a beautiful smile and was always quick to laugh, she was so naturally funny with a brilliant sense of humour.

""It’s difficult to describe a person in a few sentences, to describe who they truly were is impossible, but the people who knew her will know how kind she was and how she would bring so much fun and life to a room.

""Her loss will be felt by us every moment of every day. She will be so sorely missed. As a family we are trying to understand how we will navigate our lives without her, it seems an impossible task.

""We would like to thank everybody who has messaged and left flowers, the outpouring of love and support from friends, the local community and our policing family has been enormous.

""After meeting with the police we have every confidence that they are doing everything within their power to find the person responsible and I urge everybody who may have any information, however small or insignificant to contact the police. You could be helping us get justice for Julia.""

Assistant Chief Constable pays tribute Paying tribute, Assistant Chief Constable Tom Richards said: ""Julia was a dedicated PCSO who devoted years to serving the people of Kent. ‘She was well liked by colleagues and members of the public showing commitment and passion for her job and we are all devastated by what has happened. ""She will be fondly remembered and missed by all who knew her. ""Our thoughts and deepest sympathies also remain with her family, friends and colleagues.""

Julia's killer remains at large with police keeping an ""open mind"" over why the PCSO was murdered.

Officer say they can't rule anything out at this stage - including whether there was a sexual motive behind the brutal killing.

Kent Police Deputy Chief Constable Tim Smith told BBC Radio Kent: ""We are working very hard to identify a motive and we are working very hard to identify who may have committed this.

""We don't have any clear suspects at this time but we are working very hard to identify that.""

DCC Smith added: ""We are keeping a very open mind about the motive and until we can follow those different lines of inquiry which will help us to get close to the truth we may be able to confirm different parts.

""But at the moment the investigation team need to keep an open mind about why this has happened and who has committed this awful crime.""

DCC Smith said he could not rule out if Julia, who worked for the police for 15 years, was attacked by a stranger.

He also said hundreds of officers were working on the investigation and following up a number of lines of inquiry.

Kent Police assistant chief constable Tom Richards issued a chilling warning to women and children urging them to be aware of their surroundings.

In a press conference today, he reiterated police have no clear motive or suspect for Julia's killing.

He said the force can't rule out if her killer was someone she came across in her work, a potential dog-napper or if there was a sexual motive.

Julia was not on duty at the time of her death or wearing uniform and had just popped out to walk the dog after working from home during the day.

And ACC Richards said all of her possessions were still with her body - with Jack Russell Toby unharmed.

He confirmed ""devoted"" and ""passionate"" Julia suffered from a blunt force trauma to the head but would not comment on a potential murder weapon.

The cop said: ""We do not at this stage have any identified suspects, we are keeping all options open to us while we fully investigate the circumstances of this matter and try to understand fully what happened.

""We do not at this stage understand the motive.""

19 ACC Tom Richards said there is no clear motive for Julia's killing

He stressed Julia's death is being treated as an ""isolated incident"" that is not being linked to any other offences.

And he urged anyone who saw anything suspicious on Tuesday or Wednesday to come forward.

The officer also told locals to ""be cautious"" and stay aware of their surroundings as they hunt the murderer.

A woman was reportedly accosted by a man in a van just two weeks before Julia's body was found.

Locals say the woman was walking her dog when she was approached by the driver in Nonington - around a mile from the murder scene.

He was distracted and the woman managed to flee in panic and called out for help.

And it is also alleged a woman was the victim of a ""flasher"" recently - although the incident was not reported to cops.

PCSOs patrolling the village, near Canterbury, have now told not to “veer from your normal route” when walking home.

Women living in the area say they are now scared to go out alone in the wake of Julia's murder.

One female neighbour said: “We’re all terrified. There’s a lot of dog walkers in the area.

“It’s horrific. We’re aware there’s a report of another woman having been followed.”

Mary Bosson, a cousin of the PCSO's mum, said: ""It is worrying. We all walk our dogs around that area. I have a pregnant granddaughter and she walks her two dogs around there.

""She was there Monday and Tuesday, on her own. We don't know if it was random or what. We won't be doing it now until we find out.""

Dorothy Morgan said: ""It's so chilling. She was a really nice girl. I just can't believe it. We seldom walk about, but I've seen more people walking around in twos. Quite a lot of people have dogs here.""

Another mum, who also lives nearby, said she won't walk her dog on the path where Julia was found.

""I used to go most days on my own but I just wouldn't do that now"", she said.

""I'm also having to take my daughter to school, whereas normally she'd take the bus. I don't want her walking on her own, or waiting for it on her own, and I think most parents will probably be doing the same thing.

""There's obviously quite a big police presence so hopefully everything will be OK, and we have a strong community, which is nice.""

Julia worked for Kent Police's domestic violence unit, where she is said to have been a ""devoted"" advocate for victims.

Cops from the force's serious crime directorate are examining whether her killer was in the area the previous day.

The tragedy happened just two-and-a-half miles from the site of the horrific 1996 Chillenden murders

The crime scene is two miles across fields from where Lin Russell and her daughter Megan were bludgeoned to death in July 1996 in Chillenden.

Lin's older daughter Josie, then nine, survived.

Locals say Julia's brings vivid memories back of the horror killings 25 years ago.

The neighbour, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: “It’s just too close to home.

""You associate it with what happened in Chillenden. It makes you think, have we got someone going around killing people in the woods?

“It’s such a wide remote area so presumably whoever has done this awful thing knew the area and knows all the routes out.

""It’s a very popular path and a beautiful woods full of wildlife. Then suddenly this shocking tragedy mars it.”

Julia had two children - a daughter who works for the police and a 23-year-old son. She also had a grandson.

Officers ramped up the investigation yesterday with cops seen carrying out meticulous fingertip searches in remote woodland and fields.

The search area has now been widened to a railway line that connects Snowdown and the village of Aylesham.

Her heartbroken colleagues left a touching note for tragic Julia on a floral tribute.

It read: ""PCSO Julia James. Your duty is done. Take it easy for now we will take it from here!

The girl's mother found the distraught 12-year-old at his home and informed police, with Satish then sentenced to three years for the crime.

But after an appeal to the Bombay High Court, it was ruled the act did not constitute a sexual assult.

The ruling said: ""It is not the prosecution case that the accused removed her top and pressed her breast.

""As such, there is no direct physical contact i.e. skin-to-skin with sexual intent without penetration.

PAEDO LET OFF

""The act of pressing breast of a child aged 12 years, in the absence of any specific detail as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hand inside her top and pressed her breast, would not fall under the definition of sexual assault.""

He was instead charged with ""insulting a woman's modesty,"" which carries a one year of prison time.

The ruling sparked a furious backlash online, with one social media user tweeting: ""Disgusting to hear what a female judge said about an adult male groping a minor girl in India. No doubt India is one of the worst countries for women.""

Another added: ""This ruling was given by a female judge. That's all we need to know about India and the plight of its female victims.""

In 2012, India's Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act was passed.

It defines sexual assault as forcing a child to touch the genitals of an adult, or an adult touching a child's genitals.

The ruling could set a dangerous precedent for India, as the country battles an ongoing rape crisis.

Activists have been campaigning for decades for harsher laws and law enforcement against rapists.

The crisis reached boiling point following the horrific gang rape, and subsequent death, of student Jyoti Singh.

The 23-year-old and a male friend were horrifically beaten, with Jyoti gang-raped and penetrated with metal poles leaving horrific, and fatal, internal injuries after boarding a bus in New Delhi in 2012.

RAPE CRISIS

A raft of new laws were bought in to protect Indian women and children as officials were forced to face the horrific reality of sex crimes in the sprawling Asian country.

But as of 2017, the number of attacks had increased to more than 34,000 with an estimated six rapes taking place per day.

In the same year, a report by Human Rights Watch said survivors of sex crimes often suffered humiliation at police stations and hospitals.

Police were also frequently unwilling to register their complaints and victims and witnesses received little protection.

Meenakshi Ganguly, HRW's South Asia director told Sun Online: “The laws were strengthened following public protests after the 2012 gang rape.

And while no one has been charged with her disappearance, German police last year named sex offender Christian B, 43, as the prime suspect in the case.

Now, as the 14th anniversary of the child's suspected snatching approaches, his lawyer Friedrich Fuelscher says he believes cops don't have ""solid evidence"" against him, reports the Mirror.

He told German TV: ""Different authorities have investigated – the Portuguese police and British.

""My client has not been charged in these proceedings, he is considered as ‘accused’. Based on this, I don’t assume that there is any solid evidence against him.

""Maybe that’s a bit typical for us Germans, that at least in Europe we somehow think we’re something special and we can do things better than others.

""We’ll see if that’s the case here, but I personally don’t believe it.""

Christian B is in prison in Germany for the rape of an American woman, 71, in the Algarve in 2005.

And despite police failing to charge him with Madeleine's disappearance, prosecutor Christian Wolters said he has not given up hope of charging him.

He said: “Murder never becomes time-barred in Germany.""

Last month, Wolters said the probe was running ""at full speed"" and said he also hopes a new TV doc will help unearth more clues, the Sunday Mirror reported.

This comes as Christian B is set to be charged with the rape of a woman in 2004.

The sex offender is suspected of attacking Irish tour representative Hazel Behan in her Portugal apartment — just a 30-minute drive from where Madeleine vanished.

German cops hope to charge the sex offender “within the next three months.”

The 17-year-old was dragged to a football pitch and raped by three different groups of men in Tsolo, South Africa.

Cops are hunting 11 men who are accused of raping the teenager in the secluded area.

Officers said the girl was first attacked by four men who left her for dead, before she was attacked again by another group of four men and then another group of three.

It is unknown whether the groups knew each other of if they had planned the vile ambush.

The assault took place around 10pm last Friday, according to The Citizen.

She had been walking home from a friend's house when the four unknown men grabbed her and dragged her to the football pitch.

Those men were followed by the other groups of monsters, who rather than helping her continued to abuse her.

HORRIFIC ATTACK

Eastern Cape provincial police Chief Liziwe Ntshinga condemned the incident and called for justice for the victim, Times Live reported.

A task force has been set up to identify and locate the suspects.

Brigadier Thembinkosi Kinana, a police spokesman, said: “According to the information, the victim had accompanied her friend who visited her in her place and as she was returning back home, she met four unknown men who grabbed and dragged her to a nearby soccer field where they all allegedly raped her and left her in the field.

“Further reports indicate that the four suspects were later followed by others in groups of four and three, who continued to rape the victim.”

He said it is unclear at the moment whether the other groups knew each other or had even planned to rape the victim together.

He added: “It is also not clear whether they came from the same place.

""The investigation should uncover all the facts and motives behind this act.”

No-one has been arrested.

In a CBS Evening News interview, that aired on Thursday night, Charlotte Bennett, 25, told anchor Norah O'Donnell about her experience with the governor.

""He is a textbook abuser,"" the former aide said.

""He lets his temper and his anger rule the office, but he was very sweet to me for a year in the hopes that maybe one day, when he came onto me, I would think we were friends or that it was appropriate or that it was okay.""

Bennett has accused Cuomo of sexual harassment claiming he quizzed her about her sex life after she went to him for help as a survivor of sexual assault.

Her claims came three days after Lindsey Boylan, a former aide to the governor, claimed Cuomo kissed her on the lips and suggested they play strip poker.

On Friday morning, Boylan called on ""bystanders"" to activate and ""say something"" regarding the allegations.

""I went to bed & woke up thinking about all the bystanders that make abuse possible,"" Boylan tweeted. ""They watch it happen. They look away. They validate the abuser with support.""

""We cannot change the past but we can heal & create a better future,"" she continued. ""There are no bystanders in that better future.""

She then called on the ""bystanders"" directly, saying: ""Bystanders: you can be activated. You can do better. You can help make it right and end the abuse. End the abuse now. Say something. Do something.""

After the two accusations, a third woman, Anna Ruch, came forward and told The New York Times that Cuomo touched her lower back, then grabbed her cheeks and asked to kiss her at a September 2019 wedding.

Meanwhile, Cuomo has apologized for the claims of sexual harassment but insisted he will not resign as he ""never touched anyone inappropriately.""

""I now understand that I acted in a way that made people feel uncomfortable,"" Cuomo said.

""It was unintentional and I truly and deeply apologize for it. I feel awful about it and frankly I am embarrassed by it,"" he added.

During the Thursday night interview, Bennett claimed that Cuomo felt ""untouchable"" and seemed fixated on her rape trauma as he propositioned her for ""sex.""

8 Lindsey Boylan has also made allegations against the governor

Anchor O'Donnell asked Bennett if she thought Cuomo was ""emboldened"" by ""national attention"" on his coronavirus briefings.

“Absolutely,"" Bennett replied. ""I think he felt like he was untouchable in a lot of ways.""

Bennett also recalled that, in a May 15 conversation, he seemed focused on the fact that she survived sexual assault.

“So he goes, ‘You were raped. You were raped. You were raped and abused and assaulted,'” Bennett said.

O'Donnell asked Bennett if she believes Cuomo was propositioning her.

""Yes,"" Bennett said.

""For what?"" O'Donnell asked.

""Sex,"" the former aide said.

The anchor also asked Bennett what she was thinking when Cuomo asked her about her sex life in June, to which she responded, ""I thought, he's trying to sleep with me.""

“The governor’s trying to sleep with me and I’m deeply uncomfortable and I have to get out of this room as soon as possible,” Bennett said.

O'Donnell asked Bennett to elaborate.

“Without explicitly saying it, he, he implied to me that I was old enough for him and he was lonely,” she said.

Bennett said she now believes that ""Governor Cuomo groomed her.""

When asked what Bennett wants to happen to the governor, O'Donnell said: ""Charlotte Bennett worked with Governor Cuomo for several years – she wants the truth to come out.

""She has spoken to other women who worked for Governor Cuomo who had similar experiences.

""She reported the behavior to Governor Cuomo's chief of staff, she describes those conversations with them and then what happened after she reported the alleged harassment.

""She is speaking out and describing those experiences in hopes of bringing about some change.""

The former aide also told the anchor that she was ""tasked"" with finding Cuomo a girlfriend.

She claims she was called into the governors office on June 6, one day after she claims that he made it clear he wanted to ""sleep with"" her.

Who is Pawel Relowicz?

Libby Squire's sex-fiend killer Pawel Relowicz is a 26-year-old butcher, who moved to the UK from Poland nine years ago.

The 26-year-old was known to lurk in the shadows and perform perverted sex acts on himself just metres from young students in Hull.

He would also violate people's home and stole intimate items - including underwear and sex toys.

Relowicz carried out his first offence in July 23, 2017, when he watched a student having sex with her boyfriend.

After poking his head through a window, she was horrified to discover a condom ""calling card"" left outside her door.

He also cruised the streets and performed sex acts on himself - with two girls traumatised after seeing him with his trousers around his ankles.

Does Pawel Relowicz have a family?

Without knowing his sexual deviance, Pawel Relowicz seems like a dedicated family man from the outside.

The 26-year-old is married with a wife and has two young children.

Relowicz grew up in Warszewice, a small village between Warsaw and Gdansk in northern Poland with a population of little over 600, before he moved to the UK in 2012, aged just 18 years.

After leaving Poland nine years ago, he set up a life with his wife and got a job as a butcher in Hull to support her and his two young children.

Neighbours and colleagues only saw him as a hard-grafting factory worker, a family man and someone who enjoyed the gym.

But the 26-year-old found himself at the centre of one of Hull’s most high profile murder cases in a decade.

After raping and murdering the 21-year-old student, twisted Relowicz returned home to his family and took a bath while while watching porn.

Relowicz was arrested on suspicion of abduction five days after Libby Squire's disappearance was reported.

His home - less than a mile from where Libby was last seen alive - was searched by police, who seized computers and the Vauxhall Astra he used to drive the student to her death.

Horror Halloween masks were found in the boot of the car, as well as bags of stolen underwear and sex toys taken as ""trophies in sexually motivated burglaries"".

The murderer has a wife and two kids

Has Pawel Relowicz been found guilty?

Yes, Pawel Relowicz has been found guilty of raping and murdering the 21-year-old victim in 2019.

Jurors saw through his deception in court and convicted him of rape and murder at Sheffield Crown Court after 27 hours and 55 minutes of deliberation on February 11, 2021.

The conviction comes just over two years after philosophy and religion student Libby vanished in Hull on February 1, 2019.

Relowicz, who showed no emotion when the verdict was read out, was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing on February 12, 2021.

Libby's heartbroken parents held hands and cried from the public gallery ahead of their daughter's killer being convicted.

Libby's mother, Mrs Squire said: ""As a family, today's verdict changes nothing for us.

Hans Christian Wolters said an investigation into suspect Christian B, 44, was running ""at full speed"" – as the 14th anniversary of her disappearance nears.

Wolters also hopes a new TV documentary will help unearth more clues, the Sunday Mirror reports.

He told the newspaper: ""Even if the public does not notice it much, our investigations in the Maddie case continue to run at full speed.

""We still assume the accused, Christian B, killed Madeleine. Even though the investigation of a case that will be 14 years old in a few days is very difficult after all this time, we remain optimistic and hopeful that we will be able to solve the crime.

""In doing so, we continue to work closely with the Metropolitan Police and the Portuguese law enforcement authorities, regardless of Brexit.""

Mr Wolters said in June last year he believed Madeleine was dead and identified convicted paedophile Christian B as a prime suspect.

He is serving seven years for the rape of a 72-year-old woman in Praia da Luz — where two-year-old Madeleine vanished from her family’s holiday apartment on May 3, 2007.

She was in Portugal with her parents Gerry and Kate and her twin siblings.

A Danish-made documentary on Christian B will air in the suspect’s native Germany on April 28.

But a lawyer for Christian B has repeatedly called for police to show their evidence and vowed his client will never face trial over Madeleine.

Last month detective looking into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann want more cash to investigate German paedophile Christian B.

The operation has cost more than £12.5million since 2011 - but Met police chiefs have requested more funding in a bid to find vital evidence that could snare the man they believe is responsible for Madeleine's kidnap and murder.

Scotland Yard's special grant from the Home Office is set to expire this month, but bosses hope to be given further cash to continue probing Christian B for another year.

A summit between British, German and Portuguese detectives is due to be held in Lisbon in the next two months.

Who shot Lady Gaga's dog walker Ryan Fischer?

Lady Gaga's alleged dognappers were arrested on April 29 for attempted murder and robbery weeks after they shot the singer's pet sitter.

According to TMZ, multiple people were arrested in connection to the dognapping of Lady Gaga’s two French Bulldogs.

The pop star had offered a $500,000 reward for the return of her dogs but was told by the police to not pay it yet to the woman who “found” her pups.

They were suspicious of the woman and wanted to look into her, and she has since been arrested, as well.

On February 26, Los Angeles Police announced a woman brought the two dogs to the Olympic Community Police Station. The singer's representatives and detectives confirmed the dogs were indeed Gaga's.

At the time, officials said they were investigating whether the incident was politically motivated as Lady Gaga sang at President Joe Biden's inauguration.

One source said: ""Lady Gaga is high profile of course but she sang at President Biden's inauguration which takes this case to another level,.""

Officials speculated of it could've been an armed robbery because French bulldogs can be sold for over $2,000 and some breeds can even go up to $10,000.

Another theory suggests the dogs may have been stolen for ransom - after Lady Gaga offered a $500,000 reward for the return of her pets.

Fischer was shot in Sierra Bonita, West Hollywood, while walking Koji, Miss Asia and Gustavo, at 9.40pm on Wednesday, February 24, 2021.

Shocking footage shows the moment Fischer screams for help as two men get out of a white car and attack him.

A gunshot was heard, and moments later Fischer can be heard screaming ""I've been shot, I'm bleeding out of my heart, of my lung, I'm bleeding out of my chest.""

He added: “They stole the dogs.”

Police officers who arrived at the scene found him conscious, but barely breathing, and he was transported to hospital.

Who is Ryan Fischer?

Fischer is from New York and posts numerous pics of dogs and amusing videos on his Saint Rocque page.

The professional dog walker was walking Lady Gaga's three French bulldogs when he was shot- - with two, Koji and Gustavo stolen.

Pooch Miss Asia managed to get away and was later recovered by cops.

Public Information Officer Jeff Lee from LAPD told The Sun: ""We had a shooting that took place at 1500 block of N Sierra Bonita Avenue at 9:40pm.

""Male unknown suspect fired a gunshot. Victim was male white 30 years of age.

""Victim was transported to local hospital in unknown condition. No arrest made yet.""

Fischer announced on March 29 that he was released from the hospital after the shooting.

How long has Ryan Fischer known Lady Gaga?

According to Entertainment Tonight, Dr Fred Pescatore, a close friend of Fischer, said the dog-walker moved to Los Angeles from New York, four years ago specifically to walk Gaga's dogs.

He added that Fischer is ""amazing"" at his job and he ""would do anything"" for the dogs he cares for.

Video footage picked up the awkward moment with the EU commission president reacting by holding out her arms in apparent exasperation and muttering ""ermm?"".

Erdogan can be seen sitting in a gilded chair in front of Turkish and EU flags alongside European Council president Charles Michel — who is less powerful than the woman president.

But neither man stood to offer German Von Der Leyen — who has been blamed for the EU's shambolic jabs roll-out — a seat as TV cameras captured the embarrassing spectacle.

His apparent slight came at the start of three hours of talks on issues including women’s rights.

Shunned Von der Leyen finally perched on a sofa apart from the pair who appeared oblivious to the excruciating snub.

The Turkish leader is said to be seething after Von Der Leyen’s attack earlier on his country’s withdrawal from a gender-based violence convention.

European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer said “the president of the commission was clearly surprised,"" insisting von der Leyen should have been treated ""exactly in the same manner"" as Michel.

The president of the commission was clearly surprised Eric Mamer, European Commission spokesman

He said: ""She does consider that these issues are important and need to be treated appropriately, which they clearly were not.""

The faux pas —quickly dubbed ""sofagate"" online — came at a delicate moment as the EU and Turkey look to rebuild ties despite concerns over Ankara's record on rights, including discrimination against women.

Speaking after the meeting with the Turkish leader, von der Leyen stressed that ""human rights issues are non-negotiable"".

She said: ""I am deeply worried about the fact that Turkey withdrew from the Istanbul Convention.

""This is about protecting women, and protecting children against violence, and this is clearly the wrong signal right now.""

Mr Mamer said that the problem surrounding von der Leyen's seating during the meeting with Erdogan had ""sharpened her focus on the issue"".

The perceived slight to the first woman ever to occupy one of the EU's top two roles raised hackles back in Brussels.

""First they withdraw from the Istanbul Convention and now they leave the President of European Commission without a seat in an official visit. Shameful. #WomensRights,"" wrote Spanish European Parliament member Iratxe Garcia Perez.

German MEP Sergey Lagodinsky wrote of von der Leyen's utterance that ""'Ehm' is the new term for 'that's not how EU-Turkey relationship should be'.""

She flew home in January after being handed a four month suspended jail sentence and has worked with her mum on the film.

The hour-long documentary looks at her story after the attack in the party resort of Ayia Napa last summer, and her fight for justice.

Her legal team are determined to clear her name - they have already lodged an appeal at Cyprus’ Supreme Court to overturn her conviction for causing public mischief.

Her mum said today that her daughter, now 19, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is recuperating at her Derbyshire home.

She told The Sun Online: “She’s doing as well as can be expected. She’s OK but we are still waiting for psychological assistance from the NHS.”

On the documentary, due to be screened by ITV in a few weeks, she said: “We haven't seen it yet because it's still in the editing process.

""We’re both involved but are not being identified. It is something we wanted to do to bring awareness to my daughter’s plight and to help others who may have experienced a similar situation.""

She told how the family was waiting on tenterhooks for her daughter’s appeal to be heard, saying: “We’re hoping things will move forward as quickly as possible. Our lawyers have put in skeleton arguments.”

She said she and her daughter would not be returning to Cyprus for the appeal hearing, expected to be held within two months, saying: “We aren’t required to attend.""

She’s doing as well as can be expected. She’s OK. Girl's mum

A Clover Films source said: “We’re hoping the film will go out in two weeks but we're still busy working on it.

""Our documentary has been months in the making, following the family's agreement to allow us access. It will be broadcast in the coming weeks and we have respected the family's wishes regarding the girl's identity.""

The girl previously revealed to The Sun: ""I just wanted to die.”

In her first full interview two months ago she told how she was attacked by 12 Israelis.

She recalled how one of her attackers used his knees to pin down her shoulders on a grimy bed as his friends “lined up” to rape her.

The teen told The Sun: “I thought if I don’t get out of here now, I’m going to die.”

The men all denied being involved in any crime, with some claiming they weren't there.

How holiday led to hell July 10, 2019: Then aged 18, she flies out to Ayia Napa, Cyprus, for working holiday. July 18: Gang rape horror takes place. She reports it and 12 Israelis are later arrested. July 25: Five Israelis freed without charge. July 28: After eight hours of quizzing the girl and denying her a lawyer, police dictate a statement retracting her story and order her to sign. She is charged and taken to a detention centre. Remaining seven Israelis are released and fly home. July 30: Girl appears in court charged with “public mischief” and is put on remand at Nicosia prison. August 5: The Sun is the first to reveal details of how police had pressured the teenager to sign a confession. August 29: Teenager freed on bail of 20,000 euros but not allowed to leave island. December 30: She is convicted by a male judge of public mischief. January 7, 2020: She gets four-month jail sentence, suspended for three years, and finally flies home. January 16: Her legal team lodges appeal at Cyprus’s Supreme Court.

The girl said Cypriot cops forced her to sign a “confession” that she had lied about the gang rape in July last year, just days after flying to Cyprus for a working holiday.

A six-month court battle followed, she lost 2½ stone and suffered from post traumatic stress disorder as she was locked up for five weeks in a Cypriot jail.

Her conviction sparked a major outcry and diplomatic row between Britain and Cyprus that her version of events had been ignored. The Israeli men arrested were all freed without charge.

Barrister Michael Polak, QC, is trying to get the girl’s conviction for public mischief, given by a judge who ruled she lied about the gang rape, overturned.

He is also assisting with the documentary, describing it as “an in depth look into what happened, the court hearings, the evidence given.”

Mr Polak said the girl, who would not be identified in the film, was “doing a bit better now.”

A name for the film, which has a working title Project C, has yet to be decided. Suggested titles are “Believe Me” and “Cyprus Assault.”

They included brothers Beppe and Gianni - very much the Italian stallion version of Phil and Grant - plus younger sisters Teresa and Nicky.

The family, ruled by widowed matriarch Rosa, ran an Italian restaurant called Guiseppe's - but their main business was absolute non-stop drama.

Their reign of madness made stars of Michael Greco, Marc Bannerman, Leila Birch and young actress Carly Hillman.

But what has become of the them all since the family were sent packing in a major cull that saw only Greco's Beppe still standing?

We track down the much-loved actors and find out what they're up to these days...

Michael 'The Grecs' Greco was one of soap's original pin-ups, playing the smoothest cop in Walford CID.

He survived the longest of any of the Di Marcos too as loverman Beppe, sticking around with his screen son Joe until 2002.

After that Michael sailed into Love Island in 2005 (back when it was a celebrity show) and regularly turned out for footie showdowns like Soccer Aid.

The star also became a big deal on the live poker circuit, with his tournament winnings thought to total nearly £500,000.

Earlier this year the actor announced that he is going to be a dad at 51 with girlfriend Helen Harris. Go on, The Grecs!

Tough-nut chef Gianni was at the centre of the action in the bitter war between the Di Marcos and the Mitchells.

The actor dated Loose Women's Nadia Sawalha while she was appearing on EastEnders (confusingly, they dated on screen too).

Marc, who was born in Ireland, went on to star in a string of TV shows including 2007's I'm A Celebrity and iconic drama Footballers' Wives.

However, he explained that he had become depressed after the axe fell on the Di Marcos in EastEnders.

He told the Mirror: ""I suffered depression and turned to the bottle to get me out of it.""

The actor has recently appeared in Sky's Agatha Raisin and action series Pennyworth as well as a line-up of all-action movie roles.

Teresa certainly kept herself busy in EastEnders, having a run-in with police for possessing drugs as well as love affairs with Tony Hills, Lenny Wallace and the married Ricky Butcher.

She also didn't prove to be much luck for boyfriend Matthew Rose, who was (wrongly) imprisoned for murder.

Things are going much better for her in real life, with Leila now based in the US where she has bagged a range of exciting roles.

She played British reporter Melody Stone in the movie WMD in 2013 and was the voice of the Wayback machine in the hit kids' animated movie Mr. Peabody & Sherman.

Rosa Di Marco star Louise already had a long acting career behind her when she took up her role on EastEnders.

When the soap cleared out the family, the 69-year-old actress toured Britain in her one-woman show Face Value and appeared in a string of acclaimed plays.

She also joined the cast of Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap and has starred in everything from Holby City to Silent Witness.

However, things didn't go so well for Rosa who died of a heart attack off screen aged 50 in a sad storyline that saw Beppe move to Leicester.

Both she and partner Colin, 50, had been furloughed when he banned her from going outside - even in the garden - hid weapons around the house and threatened to kill her.

She was forbidden from speaking to anyone from another household, was punched so hard during one attack she had to have a tooth removed, and was told it would be her fault if her children died of Covid.

This was the mum-of-three’s hellish reality for five months at the hands of an emotionally and physically abusive man, who used the pandemic as an ‘excuse’ to exert total control over her life.

Victoria is far from alone - one in five offences recorded by police during and immediately after the first national lockdown in England and Wales involved domestic abuse.

In the UK, police have seen a 10 per cent increase in reported cases of domestic abuse and calls to helplines have also risen sharply.

And with ongoing lockdown and uncertainty, many other victims of domestic violence are still trapped, the suffocating conditions of being stuck at home meaning they are unable to even steal a minute alone to call for help.

Here, The Sun Online investigates the terrifying impact the pandemic has had on those fearful for their lives because of domestic violence.

‘You don’t know when you hang up if that woman will be murdered’

After the first lockdown, two-thirds of women in abusive relationships reported having suffered more violence, and three-quarters said lockdown made it more difficult to escape their abusers.

Tragically, some cases have proved to be fatal, with almost 50 suspected killings thought to have occurred during the first lockdown alone.

Just days after lockdown was introduced, mum Caroline Walker and daughter Katie, 24, were knifed to death before the body of Caroline’s husband Gary was found in a house fire.

On the same day, dad Robert Needham shot partner Kelly Fitzgibbons and two young daughters aged five and three before turning the gun on himself reportedly after suffering from cash stress linked to the coronavirus outbreak.

Charlotte Kneer, 50, previously experienced domestic abuse and now runs three refuges currently accommodating 19 women and 40 children.

As chief executive of Reigate and Banstead Women’s Aid, she has witnessed the desperate lengths women have had to go to seek help over the past year.

Most who come to us are at risk of being killed if they remain in their own home"" Charlotte Kneer, Women's Aid refuge

Charlotte says: “You don’t know when you hang up if that woman is going to be murdered and most who come to us are at risk of being killed if they remain in their own home.

""Another woman was forced to flee in the middle of the night with her kids, with just the pyjamas they were wearing and nothing else.

“Isolation is something abusers will use anyway as a strategy to abuse someone, so lockdown is just the perfect opportunity handed to them on a plate to become even more violent or controlling.""

Complete suffocation and terror

Charlotte can understand the fear and isolation more than most. She was with abusive ex Wayne Prior, the father of her two daughters, now 21 and 20, for eight years.

A year into their relationship, the abuse became physical. In one incident he punched Charlotte repeatedly in the face.

Six months later he threatened to kill her, and bit a chunk out of her neck, dragging her by her hair to the kitchen to get a knife before Charlotte was able to escape.

Charlotte found the courage to flee on her one-year-old daughter’s birthday in 2002, however he still continued to dictate much of her life for years after.

Finally, in 2011, Prior admitted seven counts of actual bodily harm, two counts of making threats to kill and one of common assault against the three women including Charlotte, and was sentenced to seven years in prison.

Her personal experience means Charlotte fears even more for those suffering similar situations in lockdown.

She says: “After each incident I’d go to bed thinking, ‘will I still be alive in the morning?’

“In lockdown, to not even have five minutes to yourself while he’s at work to access a phone to call for help - it must be complete suffocation and terror. It’s been magnified so much this year because many victims will have no relief or respite from the abuse.”

'I lived on the streets during lockdown after fleeing my abusive husband’ FOR 25-year-old Tina, being locked down 24/7 with her abusive husband Frank was so bad, she had no choice but to flee and live on the streets of London during the pandemic. Over the course of their eight-year marriage, the 28-year-old delivery driver cut Tina off from her family and friends, constantly accused her of cheating and wouldn’t even let her have contact with her daughter, now 10. Tina says: “In the beginning he was caring and kind. He agreed to be a father figure to my daughter, “But after we married he controlled everything. He would accuse me of cheating, check my underwear for ‘evidence’, and I had no access to my bank account.” Tina finally reached breaking point in lockdown last year, when they were suddenly forced to spend all day, every day together after Frank lost his job. Tina recalls: “Not being able to go out made it so hard to cope. I was terrified and drained emotionally - it was like a double lockdown.” She finally fled last August with nothing but her purse and a bag, and ended up sleeping rough for two weeks. She says: “I didn’t care what happened to me - I just needed to get out. It had reached the point in lockdown that it was better being on the streets than living with him. “While I was on the streets men would offer me money to go with them to their home, but I refused, and another woman tried to rob me but I still knew I couldn’t go back to my husband.” While homeless, Tina became unwell, and after being treated in hospital she was referred to a Solace refuge in London, where she has been living ever since. She says: “I feel safer now - no one should ever feel homelessness is the only option.”

‘I wasn’t even allowed in the garden for fresh air’

Victoria, 45, moved into a refuge with her three children aged between seven and 20, after fleeing from Colin, 50, last August.

Describing the moment she found out they would both be furloughed back in March, Victoria says: “I could have just died there and then. I was completely trapped - wherever I went, he would follow me. My daughter had to isolate and he said it would be my fault if she got Covid and died.

“He was so paranoid he’d get the virus he wouldn’t let me go for the daily walk and wouldn’t even let me go in the garden. We had to get food delivered rather than go to the shops, and I’d have to wipe everything down.

“It allowed him to become even more controlling, and he used Covid as an excuse to keep me trapped.""

Knives and weapons hidden around the house

The couple met in 2010, and within six months Colin became controlling.

Victoria says: “He’d check up on me - where I’d been, what I’d eaten, who I’d spoken to.

“I had no confidence, didn’t see anyone and was trapped. He cut me off from most of my family and friends and call me all day every day.”

One time he held a knife to my throat and said it would be so easy for him to just slit my throat and watch me die"" Victoria*

Gradually, he became physically abusive too, beating her for trivial things, such as bringing home the wrong food order from the chicken shop. It soon escalated.

She says: “When he came to bed he’d just randomly punch me. Before long this turned into sexual abuse while I was sleeping, which I would wake up to. I didn’t even feel safe sleeping, and he once broke one of my ribs.

“He had knives and weapons hidden all over the house. One time he held a knife to my throat and said it would be so easy for him to just slit my throat and watch me die.”

‘Not knowing when lockdown would end made me suicidal’

When lockdown happened, Victoria was plunged into an even more horrific nightmare.

She says: “One night I asked if he was cooking, because until then I’d done everything, including the homeschooling. He kicked off. He threw his phone at me then pinned me against the wardrobe.

""He picked my TV up and threatened to throw it at me, only stopping when one of the kids called for us. I was shaking from head to toe, and couldn’t believe he’d gone that far.

“I felt scared, and with the pressures of being trapped in the house I felt suffocated. I lay in bed every night just thinking there’s no way out. The only option was to kill myself.”

Victoria eventually summoned the courage to contact Women’s Aid, and a support worker would secretly check in on Victoria every couple of days via email.

Victoria says: “We were waiting for him to go back to work so I could plan our escape while he was out, but the date kept being pushed back as he was furloughed again and again.

""The not-knowing and false hope that he’d go back to work were the reasons I felt suicidal. I felt I was going to be stuck there forever because he was never going to go back to work.”

‘I feel more free now in lockdown than I have in ten years’

Despite being terrified, the next time he turned physically violent, Victoria fled with the kids.

Victoria says: “He demanded to see my phone, and I refused. He followed me upstairs and punched me in the face, which later meant I had to have a tooth removed.”

At a family member’s house, the police took Victoria’s statement and arrested Colin.

Victoria says: “I was so emotional, I couldn’t stop crying. It was part relief that we were finally free, but I was also still terrified. We were fleeing for our lives.”

But refuges, like the one where Victoria was able to escape to, are under immense strain.

The number of victims turned away because of a lack of beds rocketed by a third in a year - despite the need for them being greater.

Charlotte from Women's Aid says: “Currently, for every room that becomes available we have 10 women and their children trying to access it.

“It’s heartbreaking. There’s never enough spaces but we had a 150 per cent demand increase between last April and September. Having to tell a woman the space is gone is just horrendous.

“I spoke to a woman recently who’d been trying all year to get a refuge space - thank god she’s still alive.""

Many of those depicted appear to be young, and some even unaccompanied.

Images showed a procession of migrants huddling together on the ground, using one another for warmth as a Border Patrol officer observes from nearby.

Hours earlier, the group had crossed into the US via the Rio Grande river, before surrendering themselves to Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).

Elsewhere along the fast-moving Rio Grande, Border Patrol Agents rescued a group of 20 migrants who came into difficulty after encountering swift waters while attempting to cross over on Tuesday night.

In a statement, CBP said agents encountered the group while patrolling the waters near to a station in Del Rio.

""Agents from the marine unit responded to a call for assistance regarding several individuals trapped on a small island in the middle of the river.""

While en route to rescue that group, officers encountered a mother, father and their two-year-old child struggling in the water.

""Due to the excessive winds and strong currents the family was struggling to hold their heads above the water,"" CBP said.

The family-of-three were turned over to agents waiting on the river bank. None of them required medical assistance.

Agents from the marine unit then proceeded to the location the original call for assistance, and quickly located and rescued the entirety of the group.

""Once safely on shore, all individuals were evaluated by emergency medical technicians and transported to Del Rio Station for processing per U.S. Customs and Border Protection guidelines. No further medical attention was requested,"" CBP said.

Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Austin L. Skero II credited the agents for their ""great work"".

""No matter the situations they may face, our agents are able to quickly adapt, and overcome any challenge as they protect America,"" he said in a statement.

Earlier Tuesday, Rio Grande City Border Patrol (RGC) agents encountered two large groups of illegal alien entering in Starr County, Texas.

""As agents arrived, they observed dozens of people consisting of family members and unaccompanied alien children (UAC) crossing the river,"" RGC said.

In total, 145 migrants were detained in total, including 121 family members and 24 unaccompanied minors.

At around the same time, RGC agents working near La Grulla, Texas, encountered an almost identical situation, officials said.

The second group was made up of 131 migrants: 99 family members, four adults, and 28 unaccompanied minors.

""This year, RGV agents have encountered 35 groups of 100 or more people illegally entering the United States,"" officials said.

""Even with the spread of the COVID-19 virus, human smugglers continue to try these brazen attempts with zero regard for the lives they endanger nor to the health of the citizens of our great nation.

Tuesday's incidents come amid a record surge in migrant crossings at the US-Mexico border.

Republicans have urged the Biden administration to take urgent action to address the unfolding ""crisis"" - though the White House has routinely denied to describe the situation as such.

Government statistics released this week revealed that 171,000 migrants were caught at the US border in March - the highest monthly total for at least 15 years.

The total included 19,000 unaccompanied migrant kids and 53,000 family members traveling together.

The GOP has predicted that more than one million migrants will have attempted to cross into the US by the summer.

Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officials also forecast last week that they expect the surge of unaccompanied minors flocking to the US to last for at least seven months - with the 16,000 reported this month up to as many as 26,000 by September.

Compounding concerns are claims the skyrocketing number of crossings also poses a serious threat to national security.

Much of those concerns stem from the apprehensions of two Yemini men who were on the FBI's terror watch list (one shown above)

They were found within three miles of the Calexico Port of Entry

Much of those concerns stem from the apprehensions of two Yemini men who were on the FBI's terror watch list.

They were both arrested separately as they attempted to cross into the US near the Calexico Port of Entry, on January 29 and March 30.

Customs and Border Protection took the men, ages 33 and 26, into custody. The 33-year-old was found with a mobile phone SIM card in the insole of his shoe.

In addition to being on the FBI's terror watch list, they were both also on a no-fly list.

Their capture was originally announced on the CBP's website on Monday, but later deleted on the grounds of ""national security"" - drawing the ire of the GOP who accused the White House of trying cover-up their apprehensions.

Also this week, two illegal immigrants convicted of child sex crimes were caught attempting to re-enter the United States, having previously been deported.

One of those immigrants, a 46-year-old Mexican national, was previously convicted for raping a minor.

He was taken into custody by US border agents at the El Centro Patrol Station in Southern California.

A record check at the processing center revealed his prior 2007 conviction in Hemet, California, for rape, sodomy and oral copulation of a victim under the age of 18.

The man, who wasn't named, was sentenced the nine years for the crime before being deported back to Mexico in 2014.

He has now been charged with re-entry after deportation as a convicted felon and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

Meanwhile, Border Patrol agents in San Diego also arrested a previously deported child sex offender late Sunday, CBP said.

The 35-year-old El Salvadorian national was one of two illegal aliens caught while hiding in thick brush in the mountains to the east of the Otay Mesa Port of Entry.

I told my mum but she refused to believe me – as it was her brother – so I didn’t try telling anyone again.

Instead, I began self-harming to dull the pain and, when I was 19, tried to kill myself.

I didn’t succeed with this because something inside told me to stop and call for help.

I’m now 29 and my life is still so hard.

I’m on anti-depressants and the abuse has left long-term physical damage – I’ve been told I’ll probably never have kids.

My uncle is now living the life of Riley in Australia, while my future has been destroyed.

I feel like I’ve been punished instead of him, and I spend every day hoping he gets his karma.

Thursday afternoon’s press conference saw an ex-girlfriend of Hammer, who is only identified as Effie, claim he abused her “mentally, emotionally and sexually” during their four-year relationship.

Sobbing as she spoke, Effie said that during their time together she “lost the will to live.”

The woman also alleged that in addition to a horrific four-hour rape, Armie committed “other acts of violence,” and “beat my feet with a crop.”

Visibly upset, she told the room: “He also committed other acts of violence against me to which I did not consent.

“For example he beat my feet with a crop so they would hurt with every step I took for the next week.

""During those four hours, I tried to get away but he wouldn't let me.”

She went on: “I thought he was going to kill me. He then left with no concern for my well-being.”

Speaking in the press conference, Effie said: ""Looking back it is now clear to me he was employing manipulation tactics in order to exert control over me, until I started to lose myself.

""He would often test my devotion to him, slyly removing and crossing my boundaries, as he became increasingly more violent. He abused me mentally, emotionally and sexually.""

The 24-year-old continued, ""Over the years since the assault, on many occasions the invasive flashbacks were so excruciating they made me feel there was no way out but to take my own life. I just wanted the pain to stop.""

Hammer has denied Effie's rape allegation and maintains that the relationship was consensual, according to a Variety reporter.

Hammer's attorney, Andrew Brettler, sent the journalist a screenshot that he claims is between Effie and Hammer, stating she ""sent graphic texts to Mr. Hammer telling him what she wanted him to do to her.""

""I met Armie Hammer on Facebook in 2016 when I was 20 years old, I fell in love with him instantly,"" the accuser, who gave only Effie as her name, said as she broke down in tears.

She then went on to claim that Hammer raped her in Los Angeles, ""during which he repeatedly slammed my head against a wall bruising my face.""

""I could not comprehend or over come what he did to me,"" Effie claimed.

The Sun has reached out to Armie Hammer's legal representative and press contact for comment, but has not yet heard back.

Following the press conference, the Los Angeles Police Department has launched a sexual assault investigation.

Hammer has been in the spotlight after a series of graphic texts, allegedly between him and several women, showed Hammer talking about drinking their blood, describing scenes of sexual control, and references to cannibalism.

He clarified there is no intention of ever introducing a ban on men going out in the evening, just hours after leaving the door open to such ""dramatic action"" if necessary.

Mr Drakeford insisted: ""We are not introducing a curfew for men in Wales – or even considering it. This is misleading and deliberately misses the real issue.

""It’s a sad distraction when what’s needed is a proper discussion about women’s safety and why a woman is killed every three days by a man in the UK.""

The idea of a 6pm curfew on men was proposed by Green Party peer Baroness Jones in light of the tragic death of Sarah Everard.

Government sources have dismissed it as ""totally bonkers"" and say it would involve a ""massive curtailing of basic freedoms and rights"".

This morning Mr Drakeford was asked if he would consider introducing such restrictions in areas where women felt ""particularly scared"".

He told the BBC: “It wouldn't be on the top of the list of things we'd consider because it would be at the very best a temporary intervention.""

Pressed on whether he was refusing to rule out such a move, he added: ""If there were a crisis, and you needed to take dramatic action that allowed that crisis to be drawn down, then of course you'd be prepared to consider all measures that would make a difference.

""But the curfew measure you've described, it could only ever be a temporary answer and therefore it's not at the top of our list. There are other things we can do and should do.

""People need to be safe and to feel safe and that's absolutely the sort of society we wish to create here in Wales.""

It comes after Baroness Jones proposed the idea during a debate on domestic violence in the House of Lords.

She said: ""In the week that Sarah Everard was abducted and, we suppose, killed — because remains have been found in a woodland in Kent — I argue that, at the next opportunity for any Bill that is appropriate, I might put in an amendment to create a curfew for men on the streets after 6pm.

""I feel this would make women a lot safer, and discrimination of all kinds would be lessened.""

The peer later admitted it wouldn't be a feasible idea in practise - but wanted to highlight it shouldn't be women who should be having to change their behaviour.

Caroline Nokes, Tory MP and Chair of the Women and Equalities Committee also said it was a mad suggestion.

She told The Sun: ""You can't go around slapping curfews on one gender.

""Any solution to the real fear that women feel is going to have to be a lot more complex than that.

""Its a bonkers suggestion - but it has got us all talking about what practical steps men can take to make women feel safer.""

Even the Women's Equality Party said it might not work.

Mandu Reid, Leader of the party said: “After a year of lockdowns, the last thing we need is more reasons to stop people going out.

""That’s why politicians and police should step up and take responsibility for making sure women can leave their homes free from the fear of violence. It’s about making ending violence against women a priority.”

Baroness Jones went on to back a cross-party bid to make misogyny and hatred against women a specific hate crime.

Baroness Jones said: ""If anyone is being advised to stay at home it should be men, not women.

“This kind of murder is rare, but very scary. What is far more regular are the sexual assaults, threats, intimidation, cat calling and rude remarks that women face every day.

“If the police did their job this misogynistic culture wouldn't thrive the way it has. Men wouldn't assume that they could get away with it. The police have failed on rape and sexual assault for years. They have mostly failed on domestic abuse. There needs to be some serious action at the Met to turn this around and give women the protection they deserve.

“We need to make misogyny a hate crime, as that would get the root of many of these other crimes.""

An amendment to the Domestic Abuse Bill - due to be debated in Parliament on Monday - would require all police forces in England and Wales to record where existing crimes have been motivated by hatred of someone’s sex or gender.

It comes after human remains were found in the case of Sarah Everard, who went missing after leaving a friends' house in Clapham last week.

Cops haven't yet confirmed it is her, but a serving Met Police cop has been arrested over her kidnap and murder.

Sarah vanished last week as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham, South West London - and hasn't been seen since.

She left there around 9pm, phoned her boyfriend on the way, but is believed never to have arrived home.

PC Wayne Couzens, 48, is being held on suspicion of her abduction and murder.

The 48-year-old father-of-two is a Met Police armed diplomatic protection officer stationed in Westminster.

The Metropolitan Police confirmed human remains have been found in Ashford, Kent, but said they had not yet been identified.

It is 30 miles from the Deal home where Met Police gun cop was arrested on Tuesday night on suspicion of Sarah’s kidnap.

It's not believed the pair knew each other beforehand.

One line of inquiry is that he may have lured Sarah into his vehicle out of view of CCTV cameras.

His work saw him provide protection at major public events attended by senior members of the Royal Family.

It comes after thousands of women have taken to social media to share stories about how they too don't feel safe on Britain's streets.

A vigil is being held in Clapham, South London, at the weekend, for women to ""take back control"" of the streets, amid an outpouring of fear and emotion.

The head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick tried to reassure women last night it was still safe, but admitted people would be scared.

She said: ""I know Londoners will want to know that it is thankfully incredibly rare for a woman to be abducted from our streets.

""But I completely understand that despite this, women in London and the wider public - particularly those in the area where Sarah went missing - will be worried and may well be feeling scared.""

Home Secretary Priti Patel has vowed to do more to make sure that women feel safe walking home.

Vera Pekhteleva, 23, was found dead, strangled with an iron cable, after the three-and-a-half-hour attack.

She had gone to her former boyfriend's flat to retrieve her belongings after breaking off their relationship.

But Vladislav Kanyus, 24, locked the door and subjected her to hours of “torture”, smashing her against the wall, and cracking her head, according to evidence in the case.

Hearing her desperate cries for help, neighbours called police - but they failed to send officers to break into the flat because it was a “domestic dispute”.

Local residents in Kemerovo, Siberia, heard Vera trying to flee, but each time he pulled her back, they said.

They tried to force open the door and, acting as vigilantes, eventually used a crowbar to smash their way inside in a bid to save the student.

But they found her dead, strangled with the cord of an iron.

Forensic officers detected 56 separate wounds on her body, including head wounds, cuts and fractures.

Her mother, Oksana Pekhteleva, is leading to criminal action against two police officers - Major Mikhail Balashov and Captain Dmitry Taritsyn - who are being investigated following failures in the case.

But there has also been public outrage over a failure to charge Kanyus with committing an “especially cruel murder”.

The bereaved mother called the decision “scary, very scary”, with the ex-boyfriend facing a maximum 15-year sentence and the prospect of early release, instead of 20 years.

She complained the indictment specifies that her daughter was “hit four times and strangled” when there is forensic evidence of 56 separate wounds.

And the “torture and mocking” over three-and-a-half hours “is not taken into account at all”.

Leading Russian singer Valeriya - herself a victim of domestic violence - has backed her demand for a tougher charge, a call now winning public support.

Prominent campaigner against domestic and sexual abuse, Alena Popova, warned: “The (alleged) killer can get a short sentence, and even win freedom on parole.

“The police officers, too, may avoid fair punishment and get off with just a fine for negligence.”

She accused the Russian state of “defending the interests of the killer and the police”.

Ms Popova added: “This attitude towards domestic violence has already become the norm in Russia.

“The state continues to view domestic violence not as a crime, but as a centuries-old tradition in the Russian family, in which it should not interfere.

“As a result, the state stands on the sidelines and waits for the next corpse to be picked up.”

“The state continues to view domestic violence not as a crime, but as a centuries-old tradition in the Russian family, in which it should not interfere.","['officers', 'tortured', 'exlover', 'emergency', 'ignored', 'domestic', 'kanyus', 'vera', 'flat', 'strangled', 'student', 'death', 'seven', 'russian', 'violence', 'female', 'iron', 'vladislav', 'credit']","{'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=752905198150451&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sunmasthead_mobile-1.png', 'data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" viewBox=""0 0 0.7 1""%3E%3C/svg%3E', 'data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" viewBox=""0 0 0.9 1""%3E%3C/svg%3E', 'data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" viewBox=""0 0 0.6 1""%3E%3C/svg%3E', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==', 'data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" viewBox=""0 0 1.3 1""%3E%3C/svg%3E', 'https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/COMP-KE-TWIN-UP-VERA.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1200&h=800&crop=1', 'https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/themes/thesun/images/sunmasthead.svg', 'data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" viewBox=""0 0 0.8 1""%3E%3C/svg%3E'}",True,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/COMP-KE-TWIN-UP-VERA.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1200&h=800&crop=1,1,,,,,['woman+murder']

The unidentified 19-year-old was sentenced today amid speculation that she would be granted a pardon by the Cypriot president.

The teen, whose jail term will be suspended for three years, was also handed a fine of €148 (£126).

Her mother said she was ""relieved"" and shouted ""she's coming home"" as the family left court.

The judge in the case, Michaelis Papathanasiou, said he was taking into account the woman's age, psychological state, and that she had been in Cyprus for six months, and giving her a ""second chance"".

The woman was last week convicted of public mischief after withdrawing a claim that she had been raped in a hotel room in July.

She later said Cyprus police had coerced her into recanting the original claim, something police have denied.



'FIGHT GOES ON'

The woman was seen hugging her mum and legal team as her sentence was announced.

Speaking outside the court, the woman's lawyer, Lewis Power QC, said the sentence imposed would allow her to go home, but that ""the fight for her innocence will go on regardless"".

He said she had gone ""overnight from being victim to being the accused"" and ""having to endure not only the dreadful physical violation of a pre-meditated gang rape and serious sexual assault perpetrated upon her but also the prolonged mental ordeal under the judicial process in Cyprus.""

He added that she had been ""diagnosed with severe PTSD and this case has resulted in the deterioration of her mental health.""

He said the family would be seeking an expedited appeal of the woman's conviction at the Supreme Court of Cyprus and would also consider going to the European Court of Human Rights.

'THANK YOU FOR SUPPORT FROM AROUND THE WORLD'

The teen's mother added: ""On behalf of the family, I would like to say we are very relieved at the sentence that has been passed down today.

""I would also like to say thank you for all the support we have received throughout the globe.""

She also expressed gratitude for an intervention by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.

""I spoke with him and he was very supportive. I am grateful to the Foreign Office,"" she said.

Mr Raab had earlier said he had ""very serious concerns"" about the woman's treatment in Cyprus and urged authorities there to ""do the right thing"".

Speaking after the sentence, Raab said: ""The young lady will now be returning home to begin the process of recovery given all that she's been through.

""I understand how much she has been through, how much the family has been through.

""My first concern has been her welfare.

""We will be following up on some of the issues relating to the case.

""I spoke to the Cypriot foreign minister about that.""



DOZENS PROTEST OUTSIDE COURT

Israeli footballer Shimon Yusufov, 19, has admitted consensual sex with the teen but denied allowing his friends to attack her.

Representing him, lawyer Nir Yaslovitzh told The Sun: ""We respect the decision of the judge and accept the sentence.

""What is important for us is that the judge found her guilty. The important thing is we hope the girl learns her lesson from all this.""

Dozens of protesters gathered outside the Famagusta District Court in Paralimni, Cyprus this morning in a show of support for the woman.

Supporters from Israel and Cyprus could be heard chanting ""Stop blaming the victim"", ""You are not alone"", and ""Mr Judge shame on you, don't you have a daughter too?"".

Yesterday also saw more than 100 protesters gather outside the Cypriot high commission in London.

Speaking at sentencing, Judge Papathanasiou said: ""Public mischief is a serious crime which distracts authorities from their civil duties and causes distress to innocent people.

""What she did was very serious. Twelve young people were arrested and deprived of their liberty for ten days.""

PRESIDENT KEEPING 'FULLY BRIEFED'

The teen, from Derbyshire, faced up to a year in jail and a £1,500 fine after her conviction.

She spoke to The Sun ahead of sentencing about the prospect she would be given a pardon by Nicos Anastasiades.

She told The Sun: “It’s good news and gives me hope I might go home but I am still so apprehensive how things will go.

“I am scared I will get a custodial sentence, but know I have done nothing wrong and am devoted to carrying on fighting.”

It is not yet clear whether Cypriot authorities will still consider pardoning the woman from her suspended sentence.

Her mum earlier told The Sun: “We are aware of these reports and getting the legal team to check to see what it means.

“She is innocent. The whole family is terrified of the prospect of her going to prison.”

Reports suggested the woman could fly home to Britain today if a pardon is granted.

President Anastasiades is reported to have been kept “fully briefed on the case”.

Met Police chief Dame Cressida Dick has faced calls to resign over the handling of the vigil but she has been defended by the Policing Minister.

What did Priti Patel say in her Commons speech?

The Home Secretary began her statement by offering her condolences to the family and friends of Sarah Everard, following the 33-year-old's death.

But she immediately insisted that the Met Police provide a report on what happened during Saturday's vigil.

Ms Patel echoed the accounts of many women over the past week, as the Home Secretary said: ""Every single one of us can relate to them.

""Too many of us have worked home from work alone, only to hear footsteps following closely behind us.

""Too many of us have pretended to be on the phone to a friend to scare someone off.

""Too many of us have clutched our keys in our fist in case we need to defend ourselves and that is not ok.""

Ms Patel revealed that their landmark Domestic Abuse Bill is expected to receive Royal Assent by the end of April.

This is expected to transform their collective response ""to this abhorrent crime"".

She also revealed that they have brought other measures ""forward including the Controlling or Coercive Behaviour Offence and the Domestic Violence Disclosure scheme, known as Claire's Law.""

This would allow women to ask the police to see if their partners have an abusive or violent past.

The Home Secretary also announced they have introduced new tools and powers to ""tackle crimes including stalking, female genital mutilation and so-called upskirting"".

She added that the Domestic Abuse Bill will include new offences of non-fatal strangulation, while outlawing the exposure or threats to expose intimate images and extends the Controlling or Coercive Behaviour offence that will now cover post-separation abuse.

The definition of domestic abuse has also been altered to include all forms that it can take while also helping victims to deal with facing their abusers in courts.

""Robust actions"" are also being developed to continue the fight against rape.

A survey that Ms Patel first put out in December that saw women and girls give their views on how to tackle gendered crimes was reopened last week.

The Home Secretary revealed that between 6pm on Friday to 11am on Monday morning, 78,000 responses were received by the Home Office - a huge increase from the 18,000 responses from the previous survey that lasted for ten weeks.

The Police, Crimes Sentencing and Courts Bill will see the end to the half releases for those convicted of sexual offences like rape - with those locked up set to spend at least two-thirds of their jail time behind bars.

The Sexual Offences Act is also expected to be changed with regards to the section on the abuse of positions of trust.

Pre-charge bail will also be introduced in the attempt to better protect victims.

Ms Patel also revealed that £40million will be provided to help victims during the pandemic and beyond, along with the advertising campaign #ItStillMatters to raise awareness of sexual violence.

Meanwhile, she urged people not to attend protests or large gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic and while regulations are still in place.

What time was Priti Patel's speech today, Monday, May 15?

Priti Patel spoke at just after 3.30pm on Monday, May 15.

She was speaking at the House of Commons following a meeting of the Government's Crime and Justice Taskforce with Dame Cressida Dick, chaired by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

The statement was named 'Policing and the Prevention of Violence Against Women'.

What did Priti Patel say last week?

The Home Secretary reopened a review into the scourge of brutality against women on March 12, 2021.

Previously Patel has said: “With Sarah and her family in my thoughts and prayers, I will continue to do all I can in my role as Home Secretary to protect women and girls.

“Everyone should be free to walk our streets without fear of harassment, abuse or violence.

“The Home Office survey on tackling violence against women and girls has received an unprecedented 53,000 responses since it reopened on Friday and I’d urge everyone to give us their views.”

Patel also called for Chief Inspector of Constabulary to conduct a review into policing of the vigil.

What happened at Sarah Everard's vigil?

Reclaim These Streets had organised the vigil before being forced to cancel following consultation with the Metropolitan Police, which said it would be in breach of coronavirus rules and threatened to impose £10,000 fines each on the organisers.

Despite the event being called off people still gathered in Clapham Common to pay their respects to Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who disappeared walking home from a friend’s flat on March 3, 2021.

Earlier in the day Kate Middleton had been spotted visiting the area to pay her respects.

A total of four people were arrested at the event, including Patsy Stevenson.

Stevenson was arrested during the vigil, and said it was ""disgraceful"" for cops to break up what she said was a ""peaceful protest"".

Dramatic pictures showed a masked Ms Stevenson being held on the ground by two officers as she is handcuffed.

Stevenson told Counterfire: ""I was arrested by police for standing there. I wasn’t doing anything, they threw me to the floor.

""They have pictures of me on the floor being arrested. I’m 5ft 2 and I weigh nothing.""

She said: ""Several police were on my back trying to arrest me. They arrested me in cuffs and dragged me away surrounded by 10 police officers.

The tragic nurse was ambushed on her way home from work at a Covid-19 clinic in the south eastern Indian city of Vijayawada

Her ex-boyfriend reportedly tried to win her back, and when she spurned his advances he doused her in kerosene and set her alight in the appalling attack in the state of Andhra Pradesh.

Police said the victim grabbed 25-year-old Nagabhushanam and held onto him as she was engulfed in a fireball.

While Chinnari died in the fire, her heartless attacker also suffered 80 per cent burns and later died of his injuries at the nearby Government General Hospital in Guntur, said officials.

FORMER LOVERS

According to local police, the couple had been in a relationship for the past four years before they broke up earlier this year.

However, Nagabhushanam refused to accept the breakup and began stalking and harassing Chinnari, trying to convince her to elope and marry him.

The woman and her parents had lodged a complaint against her stalker ex with police on October 5, reported local media.

He was called to the station and asked to sign an undertaking that he would not harass her any more.

But just a week later, on Monday (Oct 12), Nagabhushanam launched his fatal attack on his former girlfriend after coming ready prepared with a kerosene can.

Police inspector Sri MVS Nagaraju, who covers the city’s south division of Governorpet, told the Times of India that a report for murder has been filed.

Officials will also investigate if Nagabhushanam’s death will be classed as a suicide.

VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN

The violent form of attack is not unusual in India, where campaigners have been urging the country’s leaders to find a way to end violence against women after a series of high-profile gang rapes and murders in recent weeks.

Even my husband doesn’t know what happened to me.”

These are the heartbreaking words spoken by one of black cab rapist John Worboys’ victims.

Known only as NBV, she was one of two survivors who succeeded in stopping the release of one of the UK’s most prolific serial rapists of women.

Now, she is ready to tell her harrowing story in a new Channel 5 documentary, Predator: Catching the Black Cab Rapist.

In it, she says she is “extremely appalled” by hearing, for the first time, the way police apologised to Worboys for questioning him and even fed him a possible line of defence after she reported her assault.

The woeful interview meant he was free to continue his vile assaults until he was finally caught more than six months later.

NBV says: “The police had made me believe nothing had happened.”

Women’s safety has become a national talking point this week after Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens was charged with the kidnap and murder of Sarah Everard.

He is also suspected of a sex offence on another woman three days before Sarah disappeared in Clapham, south London.

Solicitor Harriet Wistrich, director for the Centre for Women’s Justice, who helped block Worboys’ release in 2018, said: “Women are at risk from male violence in so many settings, even when they take steps to protect themselves, like using a black cab.

“Worboys, like the allegations against the suspect, was allowed to become more and more dangerous because he wasn’t effectively policed.”

The programme charts Worboys’ horrific spree of attacks in which he is believed to have preyed on more than 100 women in London over at least five years.

NBV was his 79th victim and is coming forward now because she has recently become a mother and wants a safer world for her child.

She says: “It’s really important the police do their jobs correctly and mistakes are not repeated in the future.”

Cops had the chance to arrest Worboys after she reported the attack in July 2007, but they let him off without asking several key questions.

The tape of that interview will be heard for the first time on the documentary.

Previously, only transcripts were read in court.

Producer Sheun Adelasoye, Head of Access at October Films, said: “The tape itself was never played. Having heard the tape in its entirety, I can see why.”

In it, one officer is heard apologising to Worboys for interviewing him.

An officer also suggests NBV might have offered sex to pay for her fare.

Shuen adds: “They give Worboys possible reasons to support why the complainant NBV wasn’t credible and they laugh and joke with him about some of the allegations NBV made.”

'After the pill, I don't remember anything'

For NBV, listening to the tape brought back that horrific night when, as a 19-year-old student, she stepped into Worboys black cab outside a London nightclub.

She says: “Hearing his voice is incredibly traumatic. It takes me back to being in his cab.”

NBV had been careful not to drink much that night because she was working the following day.

She describes the driver as “approachable and chatty.”

She says: “He told me he had won a lot of money and showed me the money. He said he was celebrating and asked me to have a drink with him.”

This was Worboys’ modus operandi.

He would pick up young women from outside bars and clubs and insist they should have a drink to celebrate a big money win.

The drink was spiked with over-the-counter medicines, which, combined with the alcohol, would render the woman stupefied, with little or no recollection of the attack.

NBV initially refused the drink, but on seeing Worboys becoming agitated, she took a sip to placate him.

She says: “I can only describe it as similar in colour to prosecco, however it didn’t taste like anything I had had before.”

When she started to become drowsy, Worboys stopped the vehicle and forced a pill down her throat, gripping her cheeks to make sure she swallowed.

NBV says: “After the pill, I don’t remember anything.”

She woke up in her bed the following afternoon, having missed her shift at work, and started experiencing flashbacks.

She says: “I knew something terrible had happened.”

After reporting the attack to her university, she gave a police statement, which she describes as “humiliating.”

She says police asked about her drinking and noting her red nail polish, asked if she often also wore red lipstick.

NBV said: “They made me feel like anything that had happened to me was because I deserved it.”

13 Expert criminologist Prof Aisha Gill brands Worboys actions as 'disturbing' and 'Machiavellian'

CCTV footage led them to Worboys, but when police found he wasn’t at his home in Rotherhithe, south London, they left him a note, giving him time to prepare his defence.

In his interview at Plumstead Police Station, he claims he is “wary” of picking up drunk women and despite CCTV images showing him helping NBV into her halls of residence, he insists, “I certainly wasn’t touching her.”

He was released without charge, leaving him free to attack dozens more women until he was finally arrested on February, 16th, 2008.

NBV hoped the officers involved were sacked. In fact the detective inspector in charge was given a written warning.

Afterwards, Worboys, who also worked as a stripper, wrote hundreds of pages about the attack on NBV, extracts of which are heard on the Channel 5 documentary for the first time.

He wrote: “Police must have faith in me to let me carry on working. She kept flashing and rubbing her t*ts. She wanted to sh** and f*** me.

“Most men would have got hold of her and done worse things.”

Professor Aisha K. Gill, expert criminologist at the Univ of Roehampton, analysed the disturbing contents.

She said: “For him, when she gets into the cab, that’s a green light. That’s consent.

“He has a very disturbing Machiavellian script that’s very well rehearsed.”

'We owe both women a lot'

In the diary, which also covers victim number 80, Worboys claims it was him who was the victim of sexual assault in both.

NBV is also shown pictures of Worboys’ rape kit, including a bag of money, the drugs and bottles of alcohol he used.

NBV said: “Looking at these pictures, I can’t help but think had the police gone to Worboys’ home when I had reported the crime, they would have found evidence.”

Worboys was found guilty of 19 charges of drugging and sexually assaulting 12 women, in one case raping his victim, at Croydon Crown Court in March 2009 and given an indeterminate prison sentence.

In 2013, NBV and the victim known as DSD took the police to court for failing to investigate their assaults properly, and won.

Historically, the police had immunity against negligence suits, but this set a precedent that they could be sued for failure to investigate sexual assault cases.

Lawyer Harriet Wistrich, who acted for them, said: “NBV and DSD are extraordinary women.

“They felt a moral duty to hold the police accountable - not only for the justice of their own situation but because they wanted to ensure lessons were learned.

“This was a great public service and we owe both women a lot.”

Just eight years into Worboys’ prison sentence, in 2016, NBV discovered from a newspaper article that he had been granted release by the parole board.

Again, she and DSD, took their fight to court and succeeded in overturning the decision.

In 2019, he was convicted of four further offences and given two life sentences.

Mrs Justice McGowan told him: “I do not know when, if ever, you will cease to be a risk.”

But Harriet says the Crown Prosecution Service is often “risk averse” when it comes to making a decision to charge someone in rape cases, particularly in drug rape cases.

Referring to the protests about women’s safety on the streets in the wake of Sarah Everard’s murder, she says: “I am convinced other Worboys’ type offending is going unpunished.

“This is the crisis in the Criminal Justice System that has led to so many protesting in the last week.”

For NBV, she continued her moral fight despite often being “triggered” by Harriet’s phone calls and still has nightmares about the assault.

Sheun says: “NBV is adamant she is a survivor, not a victim.

Sexual violence victim charities have slammed the reported clip, which is claimed to show men encouraging sexual violence.

While the original video is believed to have been pulled down, or even not to have existed at all, Devon and Cornwall Police are investigating allegations that an encrypted Whatsapp group has been set up to promote the idea in the UK.

A spokesperson for the force said: “Police have received a report of the existence of the WhatsApp group and are currently making enquiries regarding the credibility of the group.”

Falmouth University in Cornwall has also said it is investigating social media posts appearing to encourage the ""abhorrent"" day.

A spokesperson for the university said: “We have become aware of a number of messages and social media posts circulating in relation to an abhorrent TikTok ‘24 April Hoax’ encouraging sexual violence.

""There is no evidence that reports of these posts and purported related discussions are genuine, or that there is a genuine threat, but it is clear that the issue is causing distress to our community and we therefore want to make clear that we are taking this issue seriously.""

They added: ""We are actively working with the police to support their investigations and the university will take a zero-tolerance approach to anyone found participating in any related group chats, whether private or public, or engaging with the content in a way that could reasonably be foreseen to cause distress or emotional harm, whether intended or not.

'UNACCEPTABLE' Women's Aid has slammed the online reports - calling it an ""affront"". Farah Nazeer, chief executive at Women's Aid, said: ""We know from our work with domestic abuse survivors that rape and sexual assault are used by the perpetrator to belittle, humiliate, coerce and control. ""It takes a lot of strength and courage to report rape to the police and we know the justice system is failing rape survivors. We urgently need reform to the criminal justice system to deliver justice for survivors and to ensure accountability of the police and other services. ""The government and all the institutions that shape our attitudes – as well as society as a whole – must work together to achieve long-term culture shifts. Whether this is a hoax or not is irrelevant – rape is an unacceptable violation, and it is no joke. ""That a ‘rape day’ could be conceived as a joke brings home the level of change we need in our society. It is an affront to every woman. It also demonstrates the urgent need for improved education on issues such as consent and healthy relationships. ""Every woman has the right to live a life free from abuse and violence.""

""We would strongly encourage anyone with information about individuals engaged in any such discussions to come forward and support the university, to ensure our campus remains a safe and inclusive environment and so that enquires can be progressed.”

The police stressed that most of social media claims around the day came from abroad - and it was not localised to Cornwall or the UK.

It comes as women in the US urge others to stay indoors after rumours of the stomach-churning threats for April 24 were released on the popular video sharing app.

Meanwhile, one campaigner described the idea of a 'National Rape Day' - where laws are suspended and rape is legal - as ""abhorrent"".

Regardless of its origins, or whether or not it was intended as a ‘joke’ at any point, the very concept of such a day is abhorrent and has caused many people, particularly women and girls, a great deal of understandable fear. Katie Russell

Katie Russell, from Rape Crisis England & Wales, told The Sun Online: ""Our understanding is that this disturbing so-called ‘trend’ on TikTok began as a hoax, and no evidence has been found of the original video threatening a national day of sexual violence in the USA.

""Regardless of its origins, or whether or not it was intended as a ‘joke’ at any point, the very concept of such a day is abhorrent and has caused many people, particularly women and girls, a great deal of understandable fear.

""The ‘trend’ will no doubt have also been extremely distressing for many, not least of all victims and survivors of rape and all forms of sexual violence and abuse who might have had vivid memories and flashbacks to past experiences triggered by this.""

She added: ""Obviously, despite one particular piece of misinformation that has featured in this so-called ‘trend’, there is no day or moment where laws are suspended and rape is legal in the USA or anywhere else in the world.

""Rape and sexual assault are always serious crimes.

""It should also go without saying that rape and all forms of sexual violence and abuse are traumatic experiences that can and do have wide-ranging and long-lasting impacts, and are never appropriate topics to ‘joke’ about.""

Andrea Simon, director of End Violence Against Women Coalition said: ""Regardless of whether this is a hoax or not, we know the use of threats of sexual violence and derogatory comments about women’s appearance and bodies are very common forms of online abuse that women are subjected to.

""We wouldn't accept threats to rape offline and we can't ignore them online.

But she was hiding a dark secret - that her evil stepdad Anthony Webster, now 47, was sexually assaulting her in a campaign of abuse that ended with him getting her pregnant at 16.

Kaitlin, now 23, from Halifax, West Yorks, believes justice will be done after Webster admitted two counts of sexual activity with a child at Bradford Crown Court last month.

Webster was found guilty of four sex assault charges and acquitted of four others, including two counts of rape.

She told the Sun: “Everyone thought he was a great Dad.

“We had a good childhood. We went on lots of holidays and trips out.

“But in secret, he groomed, manipulated and abused me and made me believe that our relationship was normal.”

Kaitlin never knew her real dad who left before she was born.

But unemployed Webster became like a dad to her after he coupled up with her mum, Bridget, now 46, when Kaitlin was four.

'Abused while doing the dishes'

The couple had two more children together but Kaitlin says that she was always Anthony’s favourite.

She says: “I called Anthony ‘Dad’ and he was the only father figure I had ever known.

“Everyone thought he was a wonderful dad.”

9 Kaitlin says to the outside world she had a normal, happy childhood Credit: Focus Features

Kaitlin now says in hindsight the signs of what was to come had been there from age 11.

She said: “Looking back, he groomed me from a very early age.

“He would intervene when Mum was disciplining me, and completely undermine her.

“She would accuse him of favouring me and it caused arguments.

She claims: “When I was washing the dishes, which was my daily chore, Anthony would rest his hand on my bum.

“I felt deep down that the way he was touching my bum and being suggestive wasn’t right but I couldn’t admit it.

“I didn’t understand what was happening. I loved him, he was my dad”

""He called me his 'missus'""

As Kaitlin reached age 15, Anthony began his twisted campaign of sexual abuse.

She says: “At first he touched me over my clothes.

9 Kaitlin was in her early teens when her stepdad Anthony Webster, 47, began to groom her Credit: Focus Features

“But then he began creeping into my room in the middle of the night and touching me under my clothes.

“He had a keyring with a miniature torch on the end and he shone it under my duvet so he could see me.”

But Kaitlin says Anthony convinced her they were in a real relationship - even referring to her as “the missus”.

Kaitlin said: “I look just like my Mum and it seemed he had transferred his feelings for her onto me.

“He took me on dates and told me that we would be together forever. I was completely brainwashed.”

Soon the impact of abuse began to affect Kaitlin - who aged 15 in 2012 tried in vain to report Anthony to the police.

“At night, I wrapped myself in my duvet, like a cocoon, to try to keep him away.

""I developed dreadful insomnia, I was too scared to sleep, and then I’d be falling asleep in school.

“I confided in my mum. She confronted him and he denied it.

“Mum made him take a lie detector test and then the police got involved, but there were no charges.

“I was sent to live with my gran for a while but aged 15, I was sent home again, back to the abuse.

“I felt powerless - nobody believed me.”

Off the rails

From the distress of being abused, Kaitlin soon started to drink and smoke weed to help her pain.

She said: “I was desperate and I went off the rails.

“Social services got involved but I insisted to them that everything was fine because I was so frightened of the repercussions from Anthony.”

Kaitlin says Anthony - a Jekyll and Hyde character - treated the teen like she was his girlfriend - taking her to the cinema and giving her cannabis.

She said: “He bought me new shoes, he took me out on dates and told me that we were going to be together forever.

9 Kaitlin pictured with her mother Bridget, now 46 Credit: Focus Features

“This was all behind my Mum’s back.

“I didn’t know what to do. He treated me like I was his property. I was suicidal.”

Just before Kaitlin’s 16th birthday, her mother left Webster and the family moved to Scotland.

But her relationship with her mother broke down and Kaitlin found herself homeless.

She says: “I had nowhere else to go, and I went back to the man who had abused me. I was completely under his control.

“Anthony behaved as though we were in a normal relationship.

""He was very manipulative and controlling. I was a wreck. I couldn’t make a decision without him.”

'Baby girl gave me courage'

When Kailtin was 16, she fell pregnant with Webster’s child. Her daughter was born in December 2015.

She says holding the tiny baby in her arms gave her the courage to break free from her abuser and her suicidal despair.

Kaitlin said: “The moment I became a mother, the penny dropped.

""The life I was living and the way I thought of my dad was all wrong.

""I now had a child to look after and I felt I had to pull myself together.

“I look at my daughter and I know that I would do anything to protect her.

""How could the man who called himself my father set out to ruin me in the way that he did?

“My daughter saved me. I don’t know where I would be without her.”

She added: ""I realised that I would never let anyone hurt her or abuse her and I knew I had to get away and make a new start.

“River absolutely saved my life. It didn’t matter to me where she had come from. She was my reason to look to the future.”

In 2017, Caitlin made a second complaint against Webster - and this time police took her seriously.

She says: “I spoke to a wonderful police officer who was so supportive. For the first time, I felt like someone was on my side.”

Anthony Webster, 47, appeared before Bradford Crown Court last month and will be sentenced on May 10.

Ahead of the trial, Webster pleaded guilty to having sexual activity with a child family member in relation to River's conception when the victim was aged 16 and sex on one other occasion.

He denied two counts of rape, one count of sexual assault of a child under the age of 13, one count of sexual assault of a child under the age of 16 and two counts of sexual activity with a child under the age of 16.

A jury deliberated for seven hours and 24 minutes before finding him guilty of the two counts he pleaded guilty to and two counts of sexual activity with a child under the age of 16 in relation to incidents when she was aged 15. He was acquitted of the other four charges.

The prosecutor said: ""DNA tests have revealed that the defendant is the father of that child.""

Kaitlin said: “After the court case, I felt a great sadness.

“I was grieving the loss of a Dad, the loss of the man I had thought he was.

“Now I realise this was not love, this was abuse. I am very proud of myself for speaking out.

""I have justice at last, for me and for my daughter.”

Although Kaitlin is happy with the verdict, she is still dealing with the trauma of her younger years while raising her daughter, now five, and another child she's had since with a different father.

Although she rebuilding her relationship her mother, she says it has been strained by how she feels Bridget dealt with the grooming claims.

Kaitlin said: “The relationship with my mum is a complex one. I don’t feel she did enough to protect me but I understand her position as well.

“She had to leave Webster too.

“I want her to a be a grandmother to my kids and I want to rebuild our family with her in it.”

Bridget Jenner told the Sun: “Every one of us has suffered individually but Kaitlin was the real victim.

Viewers of the much-loved series have been speculating over the identity of 'H', the fourth man or woman at the centre of police wrongdoings.

However, fans believe a member of the MIT DS Jamie Lomax was involved in the assault of Lawrence Christopher.

Lawrence was a young black man killed in police custody in 2003 after being attacked by a gang of white youths.

Murdered journalist Gail Vella was investigating this case and after a picture of the gang at the time appeared on screen, fans are convinced one of them is Jamie.

Boston police found a video Campbell, 39, made of the assault on an ""unconscious or semi-conscious or unresponsive"" woman in 2018 that lasted at least 46 minutes.

Campbell, the brother of Boston City Councilor Andrea Campbell, was first charged with rape in 2019 after he allegedly recorded his sexual assault of a 26-year-old woman, the Boston Globe reported.

After he was arrested, detectives found videos of his attacks on seven other women.

He has been held in custody without bail since his indictment last year.

Authorities were then granted a search warrant into Campbell's cloud storage, finding videos of a woman he had assaulted on June 16, 2018, timestamped at 5:42AM.

""The victim [was] unconscious and dressed while lying on her back on the backseat of the defendant’s SUV,"" court documents read.

A prosecutor's statement continues, saying Campbell ""proceeded to rape her ... for extended periods of time while she remained unconscious or semiconscious and unresponsive.""

The council member's brother is then alleged to have taken a photo of the woman's passport.

After authorities found her video in Campbell's storage and found her, she told them she believed she was raped during the ride but never reported it to police.

The woman said she went out with friends in downtown Boston and had left the nightclub drunk waiting for a ride home.

""There was a black SUV parked nearby,"" prosecutors said, adding Campbell was behind the wheel. The woman ""entered the vehicle and had no memory of what ensued or where she was taken until she awoke in the back seat.""

City Councilor Andrea Campbell told the Globe she was ""extremely heartbroken and saddened and devastated by these allegations.""

It comes after a white gunman killed eight people on Tuesday in Atlanta, most of them Asian American women.

While investigators continue to assess whether the shootings were racially motivated, Biden was in Atlanta to meet Asian community leaders following the massage parlor shootings earlier this week.

A 21-year-old man has been charged with murdering eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at three spas in and around Atlanta on Tuesday — alarming Asian Americans already grappling with a surge in hate crimes directed at them since the Covid-19 pandemic began.

Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris met community leaders and state lawmakers from the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community to hear concerns about the killings and anti-Asian hate crimes, the White House said.

Addressing the nation after the meeting, Biden said he was alarmed at a “skyrocketing spike” of “documented hate against Asian Americans.”.

He said: ""Too many Asian Americans have been worrying, waking up each morning over the past year feeling that their safety and the safety of their loved ones is at stake.

""They’ve been attacked, scapegoated and harassed, verbally assaulted, physically assaulted, killed.""

""Hate can have no safe habor in America. It must stop. It's on all of us, all of us together, to make it stop.

""Our silence is complicity. We cannot be complicit.""

It must stop. It's on all of us, all of us together, to make it stop President Joe Biden

He added: ""My heart goes out to all the family members who lost someone in those horrific shootings on Tuesday.

""I know they feel there is a black hole in their chest they are being sucked into and things will never get batter.

""But our prayers are with you, and I assure you the one you lost will always be with you. Always be with you.

""And the day will come when their memory brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye, as unbelievable as that is now.""

Investigators said the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, 21, an Atlanta-area resident who is white, suggested that sexual frustration led him to commit violence.

Political leaders and civil rights advocates have speculated the killings were motivated at least in part by rising anti-Asian sentiment.

At least eight people were killed at three spa shootings in the Atlanta area on Tuesday

The visit, during a nationwide spike of anti-Asian violence, has added resonance with the presence of Harris, the first person of South Asian descent to hold national office.

It comes as Biden expressed support for the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act, a bill that would strengthen the governments reporting and response to hate crimes and provide resources to Asian American communities.

As he headed to Georgia, Biden stumbled as he climbed aboard Air Force One.

White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters he was ""doing 100 percent fine."" She suggested high winds at Joint Base Andrews near Washington may have been a factor.

Biden ordered the U.S. flag flown at half-staff at the White House to honor the victims of Tuesday's shootings.

He added: ""I could tell her anything. If I had girl problems or whatever. She wasn’t just my mother, she was my friend.""

'DEPRAVED MIND'

Ahead of President Biden’s meeting, Crabapple First Baptist Church, in Milton, where the shooting suspect Robert Aaron Long worshiped, published a statement on its website this morning, calling this week’s attacks ""the result of a sinful heart and depraved mind"".

It read: “We want to be clear that this extreme and wicked act is nothing less than rebellion against our Holy God and His Word.

""The shootings were a total repudiation of our faith and practice, and such actions are completely unacceptable and contrary to the gospel.""

Asian-American voters constitute one of the fastest growing racial and ethnic groups in the country and turned out in record numbers in the presidential battleground states in the 2020 election, according to data from TargetSmart, a Democratic political data firm.

In Georgia, Asian-American and Pacific Islander voters exceeded their total 2016 turnout by 58 per cent, the firm said.

These voters were key to carrying Biden to success in states where the race was close such as Georgia, the firm said.

Lisa Montgomery’s lawyers have stated she was abused in a specially-built room by her stepfather and his friends, a court heard on Tuesday.

Her lawyers have now revealed new information in order for the 52-year-old to be spared execution.

The 11th hour plea from her lawyers has been directed to President Trump after a judge dismissed an appeal against Montgomery’s execution last week.

Montgomery, is due to be executed by lethal injection but her lawyers say it is wrong to execute her because of her mental illness.

At the age of 11, Montgomery was attacked by stepfather Jack, who has been described as a ‘’mean drunk’’ who beat and raped her.

The assaults became regular, prompting Jack to build a specially-constructed room at the back of their trailer where he could assault Montgomery for the next four years.

Montgomery’s stepfather would rape and sodomise her, often using a pillow to smother her face and when she resisted he slammed her head so hard on the concrete floor that she suffered a traumatic brain injury.

The abuse expanded over time, with her stepfathers friends gang raping her, with ordeals lasting hours and even leading to the men urinating on her.

Montgomery was subjected to abuse from her mother when she willingly sold her child to the electrician and plumber, if there was an odd job that needed doing.

What happened to Montgomery has been classified as torture by doctors, psychologists and social workers.

Montgomery is due to be executed on January 12 for strangling her friend Bobbie Jo Stinnet, then cutting Stinett’s unborn daughter from her womb.

In December 2004, Montgomery, 36 at the time, traveled from her home in Kansas to the town of Skidmore, Missouri to meet Bobbie Jo Stinnett, 23, a woman she had got to know online through their shared love of dogs.

Stinnett, was a dog breeder, and subsequently eight months pregnant with her first child.

Montgomery went to see her to buy a puppy, but once inside the house she attacked Stinnett and strangled her to death with a rope.

She then cut out the fetus using a kitchen knife, and attempted to pass off the newborn baby as her own.

It is believed that Montgomery may have suffered from a miscarriage before she targeted Stinnett.

Stinnet’s unborn baby, named Victoria Jo survived, and was returned to Stinnett’s husband Zeb after Montgomery was arrested.

The 52-year-old is currently locked up at the all-female Federal Medical Center Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas where she remains the only woman on federal death row.

The Trump administration however, intends to put her to death in seven days on the grounds that she is a cold-hearted murderer and being locked up for the rest of her life is insufficient punishment.

Her lawyers said: ‘Lisa Montgomery’s life was filled with torture, terror, failure, and betrayal.’ Montgomery was born brain-damaged because of her mother’s drinking, the court was told.

The attorneys said on Tuesday that they intend to take the execution rescheduling case to the Supreme Court.

""We have legal avenues that remain open to us. We will be fighting as hard as possible to prevent this execution from taking place,"" said Professor Sandra Babcock, an attorney on Montgomery's case.

""We are asking for President Trump to please hear our plea. He can be a hero,"" said Kelley Henry, one of Montgomery's other attorneys stated.

""In this case ... he can make a very public statement about the importance of ending the stigmatization of mental illness.""

The White House declined to comment and a request for comment from the Justice Department regarding the petition was not immediately returned.

The 52-year-old's execution date was originally set for December 8, however it was moved to January 12, after her attorneys contracted coronavirus while working on her case.

The delay gives Montgomery's attorney's time to prepare a clemency application, as reported by USA Today.

Montgomery’s plea for clemency was supported by her older sister, Diane Mattingley who told the press of the abuse they had to endure.

Mattingley was also raped, sometimes whilst in the same room as her younger sister.

President Trump ordered a resumption of federal executions for the first time since 2002.

After he ordered 17 federal prisoners to be executed in 2020 – the most killed at the hands of any US president since the 19th century.

Montgomery may become the first female executed by the federal government in 67 years if her appeal is rejected. The last woman to be federally executed was Bonnie Heady, who died in a gas chamber in Missouri in 1953.

Langdell was serving a minimum of 26 years after confessing to the murder and sexual assault of the corpse of 23-year-old Katie Locke on Christmas Eve 2015.

The violent former mental patient was found by jail staff alerted by a noise coming from his single-person cell.

They discovered Langdell slumped on the floor covered in blood with injuries to his neck.

Staff of the prison, which has been dubbed 'Monster Mansion' for housing some of the country's most dangerous criminals, tried to resuscitate him.

He was taken to nearby Pinderfields General Hospital by ambulance but died on arrival just before 2am last Thursday.

Langdell had not tested positive for Covid-19 and his death is not being treated as suspicious.

A source said: ""He was found in his cell with a slashed throat.""

""HMP Wakefield prisoner Carl Langdell died in custody on 11 February.

""The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman has been informed.”

Langdell, of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, was jailed for life in June 2016 at St Albans Crown Court after admitting the killing at an earlier hearing.

The pair met on dating website Plenty of Fish where twisted Langdell lied about being a lawyer, even setting up a fake LinkedIn account.

The court had heard that, on the night of her murder, Katie had texted her friend to say her night was going well on their first date.

Langdell and Katie, from Buckhurst Hill, Essex, left Trafik bar in Shoreditch, east London, at around 2am on Christmas Eve five years ago.

They took a taxi back to a hotel in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, arriving at 3.30am.

A receptionist said Langdell looked 'very intoxicated' and that Miss Locke also appeared drunk.

She said that as they walked down the corridor, Katie held up Langdell as he was staggering.

Half an hour later, she phoned reception to ask for two toothbrushes.

Just over two hours later, another hotel guest noticed a hotel coat hanger was jammed in the floor's fire escape door.

Langdell phoned reception to ask for late check-out and left a 'do not disturb' sign on the door.

SELF PROCLAIMED 'MONSTER'

When staff later went to the room they found all the bedding and towels were missing and the lock on the window was broken.

He had used a laundry trolley to dump her in the hotel grounds in Waltham Cross, Herts.

The court heard that Katie's friends grew concerned when she did not turn up to housesit for a friend.

St Albans crown court heard Langdell was a mentally ill fantasist who once told a psychiatric nurse he wanted to murder a woman then strip and rape her body.

After killing Katie he rang a friend and confessed to the killing before telling his mum, saying sorry for ruining her Christmas.

Langdell told cops where to find Katie's body under a bush and admitted the graduate's murder.

He had previously tortured Katie's family by refusing to confirm her final moments or explain his motive for the killing on Christmas Eve.

Ex-chief magistrate Howard Riddle said there are “reasonable grounds to suspect a criminal offence” had been committed.

Riddle signed the warrants so that cops could search the homes of senior politicians and military officers - including former Army chief Lord Bramall and ex-home secretary Leon Brittan.

He claims that if cops had told him about the reliability of their witness “Nick” - sick paedophile and liar Carl Beech - then the warrants would never have been granted.

Writing in The Daily Mail, he said: “If those responsible for the application knew facts that undermined the credibility of the witness, and did not disclose them, then the applications for search warrants would appear to amount to perverting the course of justice.

“Perverting the course of justice is a serious criminal offence that almost always carries a prison sentence.""

He added: ""Judges and magistrates issuing search warrants must be able to rely on the accuracy and the integrity of the information sworn on oath before them.

""They must know that in the rare and exceptional case of being deliberately misled, then action will be taken for perverting the course of justice.""

Mr Riddle, a senior district judge for England and Wales from 2010 to 2016, says an independent force should investigate the work of the police watchdog as he insists that it did not carry out a ""rigorous"" inquiry.

In July 2019 ""Nick"" was found guilty of lying about the VIP paedophile ring in Westminster.

'BREATH-TAKING HYPOCRISY'

Carl Beech, 53, spun an ""extraordinary tale"" about ""three child murders, multiple rapes, kidnapping, false imprisonment and widespread sexual abuse"" that sparked a £2.5million witch-hunt.

But in a chilling twist of ""breath-taking hypocrisy"", Beech was himself was a paedophile with an interest in pre-teen boys.

He was convicted of 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one of fraud by jurors after just four hours of deliberation at Newcastle Crown Court.

The fraud relates to a £22,000 criminal injuries payout he falsely claimed for being raped by Jimmy Savile.

Jurors in the 2019 court case heard how in 2014, Beech told cops had been raped and abused for nine years by a VIP paedophile gang nicknamed ""the Group"" during the 1970s.

He claimed the abuse took place at the home of former Prime Minister Ted Heath - as well as in Dolphin Square, the Carlton Club, Stowe School, London Zoo, and military bases.

This led to a multi-million-pound investigation codenamed Operation Midland with cops raiding the homes of 12 elderly and prominent figures.

Over 20 hours of police interviews, Beech also said he had held the hand of a dying young boy - murdered in front of him by former Tory MP Harvey Proctor.

The politician was forced to deny ""he is a sadistic child killer and that he committed other serious sexual offences"".

He said after the trial he was still to settle a claim against the Metropolitan Police, saying their raid cost his home and the job he loved, working for the Duke and Duchess of Rutland.

Among those also accused was ex-British Army chief Lord Bramall, whose wife of 64 years died during the investigation before his named was cleared.

In tearful police interviews that spanned multiple hours, Beech brazenly told officers how his late step-father, an Army Major had raped him.

He sobbed as he claimed he was passed to generals to be tortured at military bases and sadistically sexually abused by other Establishment figures in the 1970s and 1980s.

Beech named former prime minister Sir Edward Heath, Mr Proctor, disgraced Savile and security chiefs Sir Michael Hanley, the head of MI5, and MI6 boss Sir Maurice Oldfield among the gang.

The investigation saw the homes of powerful figures raided - including 91-year-old Normandy veteran Field Marshall Lord Bramall.

He had thumped the table in front of him and denied having any sexual interest in children in interviews.

Another falsely accused general, 96-year-old Sir Hugh Beach, told the jury via videolink that the allegations against him were ""beyond grotesque"".

The 14-year-old girl was attacked close to her home by a 35-year-old neighbour, allege cops, after she went out to switch off a farm motor.

The tragic teen was raped, before being thrown into a ravine and buried alive with stones and thorny bushes.

The sick attacker saw the schoolgirl alone as she ran the errand in her village in the Betul district of India’s Madhya Pradesh region at around 5pm on Monday, say officers.

He then launched the nightmare ordeal on his young victim, said Betul Superintendent of Police Simala Prasad.

When she didn’t return home, the girl’s worried parents and sister began a desperate search for their daughter, reported The Times of India.

CRIES FOR HELP

The family searched in the darkness, until they heard “cries” and whimpering coming from a ravine close to their farm.

“She had gone out at around 5pm, and when she did not return after a few hours, her family began searching for her,” said Mahendra Chouhan, officer-in-charge at nearby Sarni police station.

“They heard some cries near a nullah – or ravine – close to their farm. In torchlight, they followed the cries and found the survivor.”

The family managed to free the girl from the pit and rushed her to a nearby medical centre, before she was referred to Nagpur Medical College, around 120 miles from her village, because of the severity of her condition.

She was “semi-conscious” when she was first taken to doctors, added officer Chouhan, and told cops she knew the rapist.

“One team took the survivor to hospital and another team was dispatched to arrest the accused,” he added.

“He was caught within hours and her condition is stable.”

The alleged rapist has been arrested and booked for rape, as well as charged under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, he said.

SEXUAL VIOLENCE

The SC/ST Act – also known as the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act – is supposed to prevent exploitation and sexual violence against people from lower social castes in India.

The alleged rape is the latest in a series of brutal attacks on young girls from India’s Dalit community – formerly known as ‘untouchables’ – who are at the bottom of the country’s strict caste hierarchy.

The group has traditionally been physically and socially excluded from mainstream society, and faced discrimination in all parts of their life.

In India, it is not possible to move between different ‘castes’.

In November, a 16-year-old was raped as she took her little brother to a public toilet in her village.

A month earlier, a 12-year-old girl was found to be pregnant after being repeatedly raped by three of her cousins.

And in September, protests erupted after a 20-year-old Dalit woman died from her injuries from being gang-raped by four upper caste men while she was out working in the fields.

Just two days after her death, a 22-year-old woman from the same caste was allegedly raped, tortured and murdered by two men on her way home from work.

In September, a 13-year-old Dalit girl was raped and killed in Uttar Pradesh.

Azam Mangori, 24, killed Lorraine Cox, 32, then cut her up into seven pieces - hiding her remains in bins and woodland in Exeter.

5 Azam Mangori has been jailed for life

He killed killed Lorraine Cox, 32, then butchered her into seven pieces

Mangori then hacked into her social media and used her SIM card to pretend she was alive and well to family and friends.

A court heard Miss Cox had the ""great misfortune"" to bump into shop worker Mangori after she had enjoyed a boozy night out with friends in Exeter, Devon.

Today Mr Justice Garnham jailed him for life - adding that he will serve 20 years before being considered for parole.

Mr Garnham said: ""You chose to kill Lorraine Cox by suffocating her.

""By your actions your murdered this bright, vivacious, intelligent young woman who had her whole life ahead of her.""

The judge said Miss Cox was ""incapacitated by drink"" when Mangori suffocated her by stuffing her vest into her mouth.

He said Mangori kept her body in his flat for eight days - and her family and friends they were ""eight days of desperate hope and fruitless searches"".

Lorraine's partner, Scottish mum-of-one Elise Fallow, told the court she will ""never recover"" from Lorraine's killing.

Ms Fallow, speaking about herself, said: ""That person died when the woman I loved had been murdered.""

Exeter Crown Court heard Mangori saw the woman as she was walking home alone in the early hours of September 1 last year.

CCTV footage shows Miss Cox's final moments as she walked through the Exeter city centre before sitting on a bench to eat a kebab, as well as Mangori later leaving his flat with a large Sports Direct bag - believed to have contained some of Lorraine's body parts.

Mangori, also known as Christopher Mayer, took Lorraine to his flat above a takeaway shop and murdered her.

He was filmed leaving the flat and then going back there with Lorraine at 2.45am - the last time she was seen alive.

The sicko used tools to 'neatly' cut off her arms and legs and disposed of her body parts at various locations, including a woodland near Newton St Cyres and in wheelie bins outside the takeaway shop.

Azam Mangori was caught on CCTV walking with Lorraine Cox just hours before he butchered her

Mangori took Miss Cox to his flat above a takeaway shop and murdered her

He was also seen on CCTV making several trips to Wilko to buy bin bags believed to have been used to wrap up Lorraine's body.

He stored her remains in his flat above the kebab house for days then dismembered her and wrapped her in bin sacks.

Her friends and family grew suspicious of the messages they were receiving and reported her missing to the police.

CCTV, DNA evidence, phone records, internet searches and toxicology tests on Lorraine's remains proved he killed her.

Mangori previously pleaded not guilty to murder but admitted a charge of preventing Lorraine's lawful burial.

Following a five-week trial at Exeter Crown Court, Mangori, of no fixed address, was convicted of murder by a jury after six hours of deliberations.

The jury was today told he was a loner with an online gaming obsession - a cold and calculating killer who harboured dark fantasies about amputation.

Prosecutor Simon Laws QC had told the jury: ""One night in the summer of last year a woman named Lorraine Cox went missing in Exeter. She had been out with friends in the evening, August Bank Holiday Monday.

""At about 1.30am she had set off to walk home alone and she had had a lot to drink.

""Her whereabouts were a mystery to her family and friends for another week.

""No one knew where she was. The answer was that she had been killed by this defendant.

""She had had the great misfortune to be spotted by him when she was walking home. He was out walking the streets alone.

KILLER CAGED

""He went up to her, they had never met one another before. He took advantage of her drunken state and had a sexual encounter with her in an alleyway.

""He then led her back to his room above a kebab shop in the city centre and he killed her there.

""He cut her body up into seven pieces and disposed of them. He mutilated the body in other ways.

""He disposed of her clothing and any of her possessions that she had with her and he took the sim card from her phone and used it to pretend to be her, and pretend to the world that she was still alive.""

Mr Laws added: ""You cut off her airway and smothered her. She died in front of you.""

Lorraine's family said she was ""the most kind-hearted, loving, generous girl - the heartbeat of our family"".

This comes after five women including Hollywood star Evan Rachel Wood, 33, publicly accused the rocker, 52, of abuse.

10 The rocker, 52, posted a statement on Instagram calling the allegations 'horrible distortions of reality'

However, Manson - whose real name is Brian Warner - has refuted the allegations insisting all his romantic relationships have been ""entirely consensual"" after he was dropped by his record label.

In a statement posted on Instagram, he said: ""Obviously, my life and my art have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.

""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""

The statement was 'liked' by Manson's wife, artist Lindsay Usich, who he married last year.

Yesterday, the musician's ex-fiance Evan Rachel Wood accused him of ""grooming"" her when she was a teenager.

She alleged Manson ""horrifically abused me for years.""

Wood, who stars in HBO show Westworld, said: ""The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson.

""He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission.

""I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail.

""I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives.

""I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.""

Four other women - an artist known only as Gabriella, Ashley Walters, Sarah McNeilly, and Ashley Lindsay Morgan - have made similar allegations against the rock star.

Following the claims, Mansion was dropped by his record label record label Loma Vista Recordings and sacked from his acting role on TV show American Gods.

AMC's Shudder has also pulled an upcoming episode of horror series Creepshow which features Manson.

Wood also shared a letter written by Senator Susan Rubio asking the FBI to investigate the singer in light of the allegations against him.

The actress began dating Manson in 2007 - despite a 19 year age gap - before becoming engaged to him in 2010.

Wood, who met the singer when she was just 18 years old, split from the Tainted Love star seven months after their engagement.

In 2009, Manson said of Wood: ""I have fantasies every day about smashing her skull in with a sledgehammer.""

Yet, when that comment was brought up in 2019, a rep for the singer said it was ""obviously a theatrical rock star interview promoting a new record, and not a factual account.""

This is not the first time Wood has spoken of alleged abuse she suffered.

In 2018, without naming Manson, she detailed ""toxic mental, physical and sexual abuse"" she allegedly suffered to the House Judiciary Subcommittee in a bid to get the Sexual Assault Survivors Bill of Right passed in all 50 states.

That same year, during the #MeToo movement, a police report was filed against the rock star citing sex crimes that took place in 2011.

The Los Angeles District's Attorney office announced in August that they were declining to pursue that case because of the lack of corroborating evidence.

At the time, the 'Antichrist Superstar' strongly denied the allegations through his legal team branding them ""false.""

Manson, who was married to burlesque dancer Dita Von Teese from 2005 to 2007, shot to fame in the 1990s with his unique form of heavy metal 'shock rock'.

At the height of his stardom, he was repeatedly attacked by conservative politicians for his morbid lyrics and was once branded ""the highest profile Satanist ever"" - a label he vehemently denied.

Total recorded offences - excluding fraud - dipped by 28 per cent year-on-year in the four weeks leading up to Easter Sunday.

And there were also huge drops in house burglaries (37 per cent), rape (37 per cent) and violent crime and robbery (both 27 per cent) The shutdown of most shops, apart from the likes of supermarkets and pharmacies, saw shoplifting offences sink by a staggering 54 per cent.

But domestic abuse rose by three per cent and anti-social behaviour soared by 59 per cent - fuelled by the public reporting lockdown-breakers.

The National Police Chiefs' Council said calls to 999 and 101 numbers had also plunged, but online crime reports had surged by 61 per cent.

A total of 3,203 fixed-penalty fines have been issued in the last four weeks to those flouting the new laws, with a third going to those aged between 18 and 24.

But 39 tickets given to 16 and 17 year olds were later cancelled because under-18s cannot be fined under the rules.

The NPCC said 83 cases were deemed so serious they are now being pursued through the courts.



FINE SURGE

ACC Sara Glen, of the NPCC, said hot weather on Good Friday and Easter Sunday had seen a surge in fines, before cooler temperatures on Easter Monday.

Elsewhere Lynne Owens, Director General of the National Crime Agency (NCA), the UK's FBI, said £1.8 million had been lost in Covid-19 fraud.

Organised crime gangs were changing their tactics because of the lockdown, turning to busy supermarket car parks to do drug deals.

They've been gloating about their 'euphoria' on social media after being outraged by Limbaugh's politically incorrect insults over the years.

Limbaugh, who ripped into liberals and was one of the most powerful voices in politics, influencing the rightward push of American conservatism and the rise of Donald Trump, died on Wednesday at the age of 70.

His death from lung cancer has prompted an outpouring of love from his legions of supporters on social media, including Donald Trump Jr who hailed him as a 'legend'.

But there are also plenty of haters, slamming Limbaugh for his offensive take on life, and tweeting that he ""did not make the world a better place"".

A Yale Law School professor, Scott Shapiro, tweeted: “I wouldn’t say I was happy that Rush Limbaugh died. It’s more like euphoria,"" before setting his account to private following a backlash, reports Daily Wire.

Charlotte Clymer condemned him as a ""coward and white supremacist"".

Rick & Morty writer, Siobhan Thompson, tweeted: “RIP Rush Limbaugh died 69 years later than he shoulda.""

Media Matters' editor-at-large Parker Malloy added on Twitter: ""My sincerest condolences go out to hell’s other residents who now have to deal with being associated with him.""

Santa Barbara and General Hospital actor Nancy Lee Grahn tweeted: ""To have chosen to live your life as a hate mongering, intolerant, racist, misogynist, infamous enough for people to know you died, but repugnant enough for no one to care, except for those exactly like you. #RushLimbaugh Such a shame.""

While some fans applauded her harsh words, shrugging off his death as ""no great loss"", others slated her, with one replying, ""I care. You are a hater.""

Associated Press explains there have long been divided opinions over Limbaugh - who regarded his title as “most dangerous man in America"" as a badge of honor.

He described himself as a 'truth detector', the 'doctor of democracy', a “lover of mankind, a harmless, lovable little fuzz ball” and an “all-around good guy.” He also claimed he had “talent on loan from God"".

18 But others urged compassion, despite political differences

Limbaugh was known for pinning insulting names on his enemies and raging against the mainstream media, accusing it of feeding the public lies.

He called Democrats and others on the left communists, wackos, feminazis, liberal extremists, faggots and radicals.

When actor Michael J. Fox, suffering from Parkinson’s disease, appeared in a Democratic campaign commercial, Limbaugh mocked his tremors.

When a Washington advocate for the homeless killed himself, he cracked jokes.

And as the AIDS epidemic raged in the 1980s, he made the dying a punchline. He called 12-year-old Chelsea Clinton a dog.

When a woman accused Duke University lacrosse players of rape, he derided her as a “ho,” and when a Georgetown University law student supported expanded contraceptive coverage, he dismissed her as a 'slut'.

But to those who loved and admired him, Limbaugh - including the ex US president - he was a fighter, especially while battling lung cancer.

18 Candace Owens and Donald Trump Jr echoed the ex-president's praise for Limbaugh

Donald Trump said that Limbaugh ""has passed away to a better place, free from physical pain and hostility.

""His honor, courage, strength, and loyalty will never be replaced. Rush was a patriot, a defender of Liberty, and someone who believed in all of the greatness our Country stands for.

""Rush was a friend to myself and millions of Americans - guiding light with the ability to see the truth and paint vivid pictures over the airwaves.""

During the 2016 presidential primaries, Limbaugh said he realized early on that Trump would be the nominee, and he likened the candidate’s deep connection with his supporters to his own.

In a 2018 interview, he conceded Trump is rude but said that is because he is “fearless and willing to fight against the things that no Republican has been willing to fight against.”

Candace Owens tweeted that she was, ""heartbroken about Rush Limbaugh.

""He is an American icon that can never be replaced. Let the life he led serve as a reminder to us all to fight nonstop for truth.

""We face dark times in this country, but we can all be a light if we have the courage to speak up, unapologetically.""

Black Lives Matter supporter Keith Gabrielson replied: ""May he Rest In Peace. We must put political differences aside and honor a great man.""

Former President George W. Bush said Limbaugh “spoke his mind as a voice for millions of Americans.”

Jill, 29, and her husband Derick, 32, have said they ""hope justice is done"" after her brother Josh was arrested on two counts of child pornography.

The couple exclusively told The Sun that they were ""very sad"" following the news that the soon-to-be father of seven had been indicted.

The former Counting On star is currently estranged from her conservative Christian family as her husband and her father, Jim Bob, feud.

Speaking for the first time since Josh’s arrest, Jill said: ""We’re very sad about the whole thing, it’s horrible. It’s all very sad.

Derick jogged while Jill rode a bike with Samuel on a seat behind her and Israel pedaled his own.

Josh, 33, was arrested on Thursday and arraigned on Friday over allegations that he downloaded material that depicted the sexual abuse of children under the age of 12, the US Attorney’s Office in the Western District of Arkansas said.

Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar’s oldest son pleaded not guilty to one count of receipt of child pornography and one of possession of child pornography.

He faces 20 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000 if convicted.

Josh is currently being held in the Fayetteville detention center pending a detention hearing on Wednesday.

His attorney Justin Gelfand has said he intends to defend the case ""aggressively and thoroughly.""

19 Kids and Counting was canceled in 2015 after it was claimed that Josh had abused five young girls – four of his sisters and a family friend – while he was a teen.

He was never charged over those allegations.

On Saturday, Derick appeared to like a tweet calling for the cancellation of Counting On.

Counting On – which began in 2016 after 19 Kids and Counting had been terminated and was meant to focus on the older Duggar kids – never featured Josh.

When asked by The Sun about the tweet, Derick said he was not backing the call to can the show but wanted to see more honesty about it.

He told The Sun: ""People assume that Counting On is a different show from 19 Kids and Counting but it’s not, it’s the same show.

""I’m just frustrated that it’s deceptive to the public to say ‘we’re going to change this or change that’ and it’s the exact same.""

Derick also said that he and his wife are planning on writing a book about their experiences, adding: ""I’m in law school right now so my time is limited but I’ve said for a long time that we are planning on writing a book.

""We’re making notes as we think of things and we want to write something that is tasteful but honest.""

Derick and Jill speaking out comes a few days after Josh was charged with two counts of child pornography on Friday.

According to the indictment, Josh “knowingly received child pornography” between or about May 14, 2019 and on or about May 16, 2019.

For the second count, Josh “knowingly possessed material that contained images of child pornography,” including “images of minors under the age of 12.”

Josh has been ordered to forfeit all visual images and property, including video equipment, related to the case.

The Sun previously broke Josh was arrested for the federal charges in Washington County at 1.15 pm on Thursday afternoon.

An insider claimed Josh ""turned himself in"" without incident.

The head-turning revelation is related to the 2019 Homeland Security raid on Josh's now-shuttered used car dealership in Springdale, Arkansas, another source told The Sun.

In November 2019, Homeland Security conducted an “ongoing federal investigation” at the lot, but no charges were filed against Josh - until now.

A source exclusively told The Sun of the Duggar family: ""The family has known that this has been coming for weeks, and Josh has been preparing himself.

""They are praying together for Josh and Anna, who is standing by her husband as she always has.

""Family members are extremely concerned by what is happening and they just want to find out the truth.

""They know that this will put them in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons, and are stunned they are having to go through this again.""

The insider added: ""The family will be speaking out shortly and hope this in many ways will bring them closer together and even closer to God.""

The arrest comes six years after In Touch Weekly uncovered a 33-page Arkansas police report claiming Jim Bob confessed to local authorities that his eldest son fondled the breasts and genitals of young girls while they were asleep in the Duggar family home back in 2002.

Following the allegations against him, Josh addressed the claim: ""Twelve years ago, as a young teenager, I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret.

""I hurt others, including my family and close friends.""

More allegations followed for Josh, as another report just three months later claimed the former TLC star was using adultery dating service Ashley Madison.

He said: ""I have been the biggest hypocrite ever. While espousing faith and family values, I have secretly over the last several years been viewing pornography on the Internet and this has become a secret addiction and I became unfaithful to my wife.""

Soon after, porn star Danica Dillon, whose real name is Ashley Johnston, claimed he assaulted her during a sexual encounter.

The TV star, 46, discussed the day to day dangers that women face following the tragic death of Sarah Everard, who went missing in London last week while walking home.

Speaking to her co-star Dermot O'Leary, Alison explained: ""I felt that adrenaline rush when you think you're being followed.

""When I've walked across the road and somebody's followed me across the road, I've got a little bit faster and that person has got faster, and I'm telling you, you think you're going to die.

""It could be easily nipped in the bud by just crossing the road.""

Many women have spoken out since Sarah's disappearance on what men can do to make women feel safer.

It's a conversation Dermot said he has had with his own friends.

He said: ""When you are on a street, you're walking home, and there's a woman walking on the same street, you cross the road, you get into the light, you make sure they know you are not a threat, you get your phone out, you do anything it takes, you do anything to make sure they know you're not a threat.""

Mum-of-one Alison called the whole situation ""a sad state of affairs"" and said it was crucial children are educated on how to conduct themselves.

She said: ""I think it starts when your child is quite young to be honest.

Earlier this afternoon police confirmed human remains in woodland in Ashford, Kent, were Sarah Everard.

She vanished last week after leaving a friend's house in Leathwaite Road in Clapham at about 9pm.

Sarah headed through a back gate on to the A205 South Circular before she is believed to have walked across Clapham Common.

The marketing manager had spoken to her partner on the phone for about 15 minutes.

Moments later, as armed cops arrive, a small child can be heard asking: “Did Daddy die?”

The shocking footage forms the opening scenes of the new BBC2 documentary The Detectives: Fighting Organised Crime, which airs tonight.

Filmed in Manchester, with unprecedented access to police operations, the series followed the Major Incident Team (MIT) for two years as they tackled the growing violence amongst rival gangs.

The kidnap victim, beaten and abducted by five men in front of his terrified wife and kids, was tortured for 24 hours.

He had his ears burned with a blowtorch, hot irons put on his knees and was forcibly injected with heroin before being released for a ransom of £34,000.

But Detective Sergeant Julie Connor says extreme violence is becoming the norm as profits from drug smuggling and people trafficking soar.

“We’re seeing increasing violence in these gangs, with people being shot in the legs, stabbed, having their faces cut,” she says.

“If a girl disrespects a criminal male, they have their head shaved. Rape is used as a punishment. I’ve dealt with all those things.”

'Are you going to kill Daddy?'

In the year ending September 2020, over 278,000 crimes are reported to Greater Manchester Police, the highest crime rate outside London.

There were over 88,000 violent crimes and 47 murders.

But while most murders take just weeks to solve, catching members of an Organised Crime Gang (OCG) can take years.

DS Connor is one of a team of seven whose sole purpose is cracking OCGs, and she says Manchester is rife with gang violence.

“We’ve got people smugglers, drug smugglers, people who commit wide scale fraud,” she says.

“There’s a lot of kidnaps that happened in Manchester and the violence used is escalating.”

In the first kidnap featured in the show, the terrified wife of the victim told officers: “They beat him up in front of the kids, and said ‘we’re gonna shoot you in the head if you don’t do what we’re saying.”

Her seven-year-old son asked the gunman: ""Are you going to kill my daddy?"".

Chillingly, he replied: “Don’t worry, your daddy will be home tonight, if he gives us what we want.”

The kids - clearly traumatised by what they have seen - are heard telling officers “They’re going to kill Daddy. He had a gun, a revolver, a six shooter.”

While shocking, kidnaps in front of family are no longer rare in the city.

“With the rise in drugs there’s a lot of money swimming around and there’s a lot of criminals targeting other criminals,” says DS Connor.

“Gangs make more of an impact if they terrify them in their own home, so whatever is being demanded they’ll pay.”

Stabbings and shootings go unreported

Despite horrific injuries the kidnap victim, a car dealer, refused to cooperate with police after his release.

But with rival gangs increasingly targeting each other, it’s common for brutal crimes to go under the radar entirely.

“A lot of crimes in Manchester are going unreported in the criminal underworld - shootings, stabbings, kidnaps,” says DS Connor.

“It happens in the hours of darkness, away from witnesses, street lights and CCTV cameras so we are always playing catch up.”

After CCTV showed two men picking up a bag, containing the £34,000 ransom money, the unit intercepted their car and arrested gang member Paris Bostock for the crime.

The stepson of known crime boss, Darren Berkeley - feared for his use of extreme violence - Bostock has a string of convictions going back to the age of 16.

“He’s had the influence of Darren Berkeley in his life. He’s seen violence, he’s been around violence,” says DS Connor.

A surveillance officer also reports seeing Bostock and others at a crack den on the day of the kidnap and, on raiding the property, found a paint-stripping gun, a hotplate and a ring of duct tape used as a gag or a binding for arms.

Hair and DNA on the tape belonged to the victim and Bostock.

Tied to chair and beaten with iron bars, hammers and pistol

Just four weeks after the first kidnapping, two members of the public report “loads of screaming” as a second victim is dragged from his Fallowfield home and thrown into the boot of a car.

Three hours later, the police find the man, legs and arms bound with cable ties, dumped on the street.

He had been beaten with iron bars, had his feet smashed with hammers and his face was so badly swollen that he couldn’t open his eyes.

He was later found to have a bleed on the brain.

The known drug dealer told police: “They put a hood over my head, they took me to an address, to an empty room with a chair in it.

“They got bars and beat my feet asking me for money. They'd beat me for two or three minutes , stop for two or three minutes, throw water at me and, at one point, put a gun to my head.”

Despite demanding £200,000 from the man, then £50,000, no ransom was paid.

“It was chaotic,” says DS Connor. “They lost the plot and decided to just batter him.

“That’s what happens in a gang situation, the adrenaline going, testosterone going - the gangs are prepared to use extreme violence. It quickly goes out of control.”

Harrowing CCTV footage showed the victim being pistol-whipped and beaten as five men in balaclavas forced him into a VW Golf, with one recognisable as Bostock.

The seats of an abandoned VW Tiguan, found near the site of the abduction, were ""absolutely sodden"" with blood and two live cartridges from a gun were discovered on the pavement.

A baseball cap, also recovered at the scene, led them to a gang member’s house where the gun was recovered and later found to have traces of DNA from Darren Berkeley and another associate, Blake Evers.

In disturbing scenes at the police custody suites, Paris Bostock is seen threatening male and female police officers with violence.

DS Connor says he is among the “volatile, unpredictable types” they have to deal with and she admits she is often afraid.

“When you first walk in and you’re faced with the criminal you’ve been hunting down for weeks or months, it is exhilarating,” she says.

“But these serious criminals are very intimidating. The crimes they’ve committed have been particularly violent. You’d be daft not to get scared.”

Crime bosses harder to snare

In January 2020, Paris Bostock, 26, and Elliot Cummings, 29, were sentenced to nine years and six years respectively for their parts in the kidnappings.

Berkeley, 43, was given 12 years and 24-year-old Blake Evers, who had no previous convictions, received a 19 year sentence.

For DS Connor, it’s gang leaders like Berkeley who are the ultimate prize - and often escape justice.

“With gangs there’s a hierarchy, there’s someone at the top, pulling the strings. Generally they are older, smarter, and are distanced from the actual crime,” she says.

“Those lower down are the visible ones, they get the heavier sentences, they’re easier to catch, they make more mistakes. For us to catch those at the top is rare.”

Episode 2 of the documentary shows a shocking murder caught on camera, with men in balaclavas peppering a van with gunfire in broad daylight, as children play on the street nearby.

While gangs are getting more brazen, DS Connor says the problem goes back decades and men involved have been schooled in violence from a young age.

Tyson has two children with wife Lakiha Spicer including his 12-year-old daughter Milan.

Speaking during his podcast with Devin Haney, he admitted he used to rob girls just like her.

The 54-year-old, who has fathered eight kids, said: ""My kids are better than me now.

""Right now, my kids are better than me. Because my daughter, she is 12, I was locked up at 12.

""And she is a smart a** at 12. Spoilt, have everything. I used to rob children like that.

""Now, I raise children like that. Life is great.""

Tyson was raised in Brownsville, a neighbourhood rife with crime, and he didn't know his biological father Purcell Tyson.

His stepdad Jimmy Kirkpatrick walked out on him and his family soon after he was born.

Convicted killer and sex offender Sergei Pimenov forced children to undergo violent initiations involving hot wax and lashings with sticks, it is claimed.

The 44-year-old advertised sessions online after being released from prison on parole last year.

One read: “I accept boys from 12 to 18 years old for free education in my magic school.”

One boy, 15, has told how he went for “classes” with Pimenov and was subjected to a brutal “initiation rite”.

He said he was lashed with a stick on his chest and back in a forest “ritual” at Dolgoprudny near Moscow, Russia.

""Then he [Pimenov] took a candle, lit it and burned a star right on the wounds on my back,"" the victim said.

""I was so exhausted that I did not understand what was going on at all,"" he told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.

Law enforcement say the wounded teenager was then sexually abused by the suspect.

Another victim, also 15, was struck 180 times with a stick on each side of his body before also suffering sexual abuse, it is alleged.

The first boy said the “sorcerer” had initially seemed to cure his mother of illness and returned his girlfriend with spells.

But then the “magician” made threats against him and his family and told the boy he would “rape his sisters” unless he cooperated, he said.

After undergoing the initiation, the boy said he was “ashamed and scared”.

But he bravely told his stepfather about the sessions, which led to Pimenov being held by police on suspicion of sex offences against underage boys.

""Peminov threatened me, said that he would kill me and my whole family, and demanded money from me,"" the boy said.

""It was scary, but I pulled myself together and told everything to my stepfather, and then to my mother.""

The newspaper reported: ""The master of dark forces did not just molest children, he staged whole performances with hot wax and burning pentagrams on the bodies of his victims, claiming that this was necessary to obtain the Force.""

A criminal case has been launched for “violent acts of a sexual nature” against minors, said Olga Vrady, an official of Russia’s Investigative Committee.

A number of victims have been identified, said the committee, and a psychologist is working with the first victim.

Pimenov has been detained for two months pending investigations.

The family’s lawyer, Ravil Iskandarov, said Pimenov is a “danger to society” and should face a 20-year jail term.

PC Wayne Couzens, 48, was being held on suspicion of her abduction and murder.

The dramatic development came as Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said human remains had been found in woods — but did not confirm that they belonged to marketing executive Sarah, 33.

Dame Cressida said: “We are not able to confirm any identity. That may take some considerable time.

“The news it was a Met Police officer arrested on suspicion of Sarah’s murder has sent shockwaves and anger through the public and the Met. I speak on behalf of all our colleagues when I say we are utterly appalled.”

Sarah’s family were earlier said to be “absolutely distraught” over the officer’s arrest but holding out hope for her safe recovery.

Cops moved in on married dad-of-two PC Couzens after a car linked to him was allegedly spotted on a motorist’s dashcam near to where Sarah was last seen on the night of Wednesday March 3.

Police do not believe PC Couzens had ever met Sarah Everard previously.

The marksman, whose role involves guarding politicians and protecting events attended by senior royals, is believed to have worked a shift in South London that day.

His Ukraine-born wife Elena, 38, who works as a laboratory manager, has also been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.

A source said last night: “The working hypothesis is that he saw Sarah on the street for the first time and kidnapped her.

“At this stage it is thought the officer used his warrant card to entice Sarah towards his car.

“One theory is that he may have used the Covid lockdown as a pretext to engage with her and then snatched her.”

PC Couzens is attached to the Met’s Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection (PaDP) unit normally based at the Palace of Westminster.

Detectives probing Sarah’s ­suspected murder searched his locker yesterday.

22 A car was seized from the Kent home of Wayne Couzens

She had vanished in Clapham, South West London, while walking home alone from a friend’s house.

The movements of the car, believed to have been hired, were said to have been tracked by ANPR cameras from the scene.

It is understood PC Couzens worked a 2pm to 8pm relief shift at the US Embassy in Nine Elms, South West London.

It is around three miles from where Sarah, who was wearing a green rain jacket and navy blue trousers with a white diamond pattern, was last seen on a doorbell camera at 9.30pm.

At the time she was walking alone on Poynders Road, part of the South Circular, after a 15-minute phone call with her boyfriend Josh Lowth.

Moments later PC Couzens is suspected of bundling Sarah into his car out of view of cameras.

Cops had cordoned off flats on Poynders Road at 4pm on Tuesday and searched the immediate vicinity.

It is close to the spot where she was last seen and where her last mobile phone signal was traced.

At 8pm on Tuesday detectives arrested PC Couzens at his home in Deal, Kent, and led him out in handcuffs an hour later.

He was initially held on suspicion of ­kidnap. Yesterday he was further arrested for Sarah’s murder and an unconnected offence of indecent exposure.

The couple’s modern terraced house and garden were searched.

The family cars, a nine-year-old black SEAT Exeo and Peugeot 107, were taken away for forensic examination.

Police also seized phones to ­analyse cell site data and pin down PC Couzens’ movements.

Early yesterday a helicopter and police search adviser (PolSA) teams scoured woodland near Betteshanger Park, Deal, for up to four hours.

Officers with specialist dogs also descended on woods and ­derelict buildings 30 miles away at a former golf course and paint­balling centre at Great Chart, near Ashford, Kent.

The site was blocked off by a police van, with around six more near the building.

One local told The Sun: “I saw police with flashlights searching in my outhouse, our garden and the fields next to it at around 1am.

“There were dozens of them and there was a helicopter flying above for ages. It was shocking.”

The Met said yesterday: “A man arrested in connection with the ­disappearance of Sarah Everard remains in custody at a London police station.

“The man, who is aged in his 40s, was arrested on the evening of Tuesday March 9 on suspicion of kidnap.

“Today he has been further arrested on suspicion of murder and a separate allegation of indecent exposure.”

The Met added: “The man is a serving Metropolitan Police officer in the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command.

“His primary role was uniformed patrol duties of diplomatic premises.

“A woman, who is aged in her 30s, was also arrested on the evening of March 9 on suspicion of assisting an offender. She remains in custody.

“Officers are searching locations in London and Kent including a property in Deal and an area of woodland near Ashford.”

The Met has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct over the case.

Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave yesterday stressed the suspect was off duty at the time of Sarah’s abduction.

He described the officer’s arrest as a “serious and significant development”.

Mr Ephgrave said: “We will continue to work with all speed on this investigation. But the fact that the arrested man is a serving Metropolitan Police officer is both shocking and deeply disturbing.

“I understand there will be significant public concern but it is essential that the investigative team are given the time and space to continue their work.”

The Met’s Directorate of Professional Standards is involved and checking PC Couzens’ duty rosters and work records.

It is understood he spent around ten years as a TA reservist with the Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment.

He joined the Met in 2018 after transferring from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC), where he was an authorised firearms officer.

Couzens joined Britain’s nuclear force in 2011 after working at a family business in Dover for around 12 years.

He was initially based at the CNC’s Dungeness site in Kent and also worked on escorts and ­counter-terror duties elsewhere.

He joined the Met during a recruitment drive for armed police following the 2017 terror attacks.

Couzens had to pass rigorous physical and mental assessments before being accepted.

A former colleague said: “His arrest over Sarah is truly shocking.”

Durham University graduate Sarah comes from a close-knit family. Dad Jeremy, 67, a professor of electronics at York University and charity worker mum Sue, 64, were being kept updated.

The couple have a son James, who lives in London.

They also have another daughter Katie, who lives in New York.

Sarah’s uncle Nick last night said the family were absolutely distraught over the arrest.

Nick, from Coventry, added: “We know they arrested an armed officer but we don’t know him. It’s really shocked us all.”

On the night she vanished, Sarah had visited a friend in Leathwaite Road, Clapham.

She left by a back gate at 9pm for the 50-minute walk back to her flat in Brixton.

Sarah, also seen wearing a white beanie hat and Covid mask, walked across Clapham Common before coming on to the A205 South Circular Road.

Murder detectives took over the case on Sunday.

But until yesterday, the Met continued to stress they were dealing with a missing persons inquiry and had no evidence Sarah had come to any harm.

Police are continuing to trawl through CCTV in the Clapham area and have appealed for anyone else with any vehicle dashcam footage to come forward.

Five women, including ex-fiancee and actress Evan Rachel Wood, came forward to accuse Marilyn, 52, of abuse.

In Marilyn’s 1998 autobiography, The Long Hard Road Out of Hell, exclusively obtained by The Sun, he confessed to almost killing a woman during a bondage stunt.

While on tour with Nine Inch Nails and Jim Rose in the ‘90s, Marilyn wrote that he and his band members swore to “stop exploiting and humiliating girls backstage,” and to instead perform a “therapeutic service for them.”

He said this involved a “video camera and some girls willing to confess their deepest, most intimate sins.”

Marilyn described how a female almost died while in the sex trap.

Marilyn wrote: “She released the pressure on her hands and legs and allowed [the] contraption to snap tightly around her neck. Her head hit the floor, unconscious. I bent down in a daze and began fumbling with the knots and rope, unable to do a thing as her face swelled from red to purple.

A band member ""pulled an army knife out of his pocket and sliced through the cord trailing from her neck, releasing the tension.""

The singer continued: ""But she didn’t wake up. We slapped her, screamed at her, dumped water on her. Nothing worked. This was bad. I didn’t want to be the first rock-and-roller to have actually killed a girl due to backstage hedonism.

“After three minutes, she groaned and blinked her eyes open. That was probably the last time she ever wanted to go backstage again.”

In another example, Marilyn, whose real name is Brian Warner, described the “new invention” he and a band member tried out on a man.

He wrote: “[My band member] asked the boy if he minded being tied up and restrained, then brought him into the back room of the dressing area, requesting several minutes to set up. When I walked in, he was hog-tied with his hands behind his back in an apparatus that forced him to keep his legs spread at a ninety degree angle and his hands behind his back.

“If he moved any limb from that position, the rope around his neck would tighten and begin to choke him. In order to keep from strangling himself, he had to work to keep himself in this awkward, vulnerable position. Tony stood over him with a video camera, capturing his struggle from every angle.”

The acts in the memoir are similar to those made by one of his accusers, an artist named Gabriella.

She claimed in an Instagram statement: “He would tie me up for the first of many times and rape me. I sobbed on the floor in the hotel room and when I looked at him, he was smiling. He told me he knew that’s how I loved him because of my reaction. He took naked photos of me without my permission while I was sleeping tied up and sent them to his friends.”

On Monday, Marilyn’s ex-fiancee Rachel, 33, accused the singer of “grooming” her as a teenager.

The Westworld actress wrote on Instagram: “The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson.

“He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail.

""I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives. I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.”

The other women- Ashley Walters, Sarah McNeilly and Ashley Lindsay Morgan - have made similar allegations against him.

Jenna Jameson, who admitted to having an affair with Marilyn in the ‘90s, claimed he fantasized about wanting to burn her body alive.

Actress Rose McGowan, who was engaged to Marilyn before splitting in 2001, tweeted: ""I stand with Evan Rachel Wood and other brave women who have come forward.

“It takes years to recover from abuse and I send them strength on their journey to recovery. Let the truth be revealed. Let the healing begin.”

Marilyn responded to the claims in an Instagram statement that read: “Obviously, my life and my art have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.

13 Marilyn denied the claims on Instagram Credit: EPA

""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.”

Marilyn has since been dropped by his record label and booking agent.

Also in The Long Hard Road Out of Hell, he penned that he threatened to rape a woman in an effort to “get her attention.”

The rocker wrote that he and a friend had a crush on the same woman, who he described as a “hot brunette.”

Marilyn wrote of the woman, who worked at the piercing pagoda: “But she wouldn’t even acknowledge our humanity, no matter what part of our body we asked her to pierce. So I fell back on my usual deviant way of getting a girl’s attention: malicious, asinine behavior.”

He claimed that “every day for nearly a month,” he and the friend “met at a pay phone around the corner from the pagoda, where we could see her but she couldn’t see us.”

The singer penned: “At first, the calls were harmless. But they quickly grew meaner. ‘We’re watching you,’ we’d threaten her at the height of our spite-masked lust. You better not leave work tonight, because we’re going to rape you in the parking lot and then crush you underneath your own car.”

Marilyn also wrote in the memoir how he used to shoot birds with a BB gun as a child and how he once murdered a rabbit.

13 He also admitted to killing animals Credit: Reuters

He wrote: “That afternoon I was out for blood and, unfortunately, a white rabbit crossed our path. The thrill of hitting it was incommensurate, but then I went to examine the damage. It was still alive and blood was pouring out of its eye, soaking into its white fur.

“Its mouth kept meekly opening and closing, taking in air in a last, desperate attempt at life. For the first time, I felt bad for an animal I had shot. I took a large flat rock and ended its suffering with a loud, quick and messy blow.”

As The Sun previously reported, Marilyn once boasted about plotting the murder of an ex-lover in the book.

When the singer wrote how he broke up with a woman named Nancy and kicked her out of his band, she got revenge by calling clubs to cancel their shows, showing up at concerts to threaten people in the audience, “attacking” the woman who replaced her, calling mutual friends to smear his name and sending him “obscene messages and packages.”

The rocker said of her antics: “Never in my life had anyone ever made me so violently angry before. She was ruining my life when we were sleeping together, and now that we weren’t, she was destroying it even more thoroughly. Every night when I came home there was a new death threat waiting for me.

“I finally called her and laid it on the line: ‘Not only are you not going to be in the band anymore, but if you don’t leave town I’m going to have you killed.' I wasn’t exaggerating. I was infuriated, I had nothing to lose and I was so emotionally wrapped up in the situation that I had no perspective.”

He penned that while he “didn’t think it was right to take a human life,” he also didn’t think it was fair to “deny myself the chance of causing someone to die either, especially someone whose existence meant so little to the world and to herself.”

The singer continued: “This was the first time I had ever seriously considered murder. I wasn’t sure what to do… I wasn’t going to accept any other alternative. She had to die. In my mind, I built her into a symbol, a representation of everyone who had ever tried to possess me or control my mind, whether it be through Christianity or sex, and I wanted revenge—compensation—for the boy they had warped and destroyed.”

It's kind of long, but it's full of suspense.""

Over 148 tweets, she proceeded to tell a story of sex and violence so spectacular it became one of the biggest social media events of the year – and soon a film adaptation will be in cinemas.

Zola, aka A’Ziah Wells, published her astonishing account in 2015 of what she claimed had happened when she went to Florida with a stranger one weekend to perform in strip clubs – which quickly became a nightmare of sex trafficking and bloodshed.

Zola, who was just 20 at the time, said she was invited on the ill-fated journey by a customer she served at Hooters named Jessica.

But in her story, the weekend quickly spiralled out of control when Zola realised that Jessica's pimp, Z, wanted her to earn extra cash through prostitution.

And things got worse when Jessica's bipolar boyfriend, Jarrett, discovered Jessica's sex work, and responded by punching himself and attempting suicide by jumping off a balcony.

This is all before Zola claimed a Florida pimp beat Jessica up and tried to ""buy"" her off Z – who responded by shooting him in the face.

But how much of what became known as #TheStory really happened?

Sun, sex and serious violence

Zola says the ordeal began when she ""met this white b***h at Hooters"" in Detroit – and things quickly went south from there.

She and Jessica bonded over them both being exotic dancers and swapped phone numbers.

Soon after, Jessica invited Zola to go on a trip with her to Florida to make money. Zola says she was reluctant, but had made $15,000 stripping in the Sunshine State a few months earlier so agreed.

Zola's boyfriend was also against her going with someone she barely knew, with her tweeting ""I had to f**k him calm"" before she left.

The thread claimed that going with them were Jessica's boyfriend, Jarrett, and her ""roommate"" Z – who Zola says she didn't find out was Jessica's pimp until after they'd performed, and Jessica advised Zola to hide tips they'd earned.

Angered that Jessica hadn't made enough cash, Z asked her if she wanted to ""trap"", which ""in stripper lingo means trick"", Zola tweeted.

Horrified, Zola says she tried to leave, but Jessica cried and convinced her to stay as security while she proceeded to have sex with ""about 20 dudes"".

Meanwhile, Zola's thread said Jessica's boyfriend Jarrett became suspicious as to why the girls hadn't come back to the motel they were supposed to stay in after the strip club closed.

According to Zola's story, he worked out what Jessica was up to and revealed that she's a sex worker on Facebook to humiliate her.

In the story, Z responds by first threatening Jarrett with a gun, then forces him to watch him having sex with Jessica to ""kill his manhood"".

Later, a Florida pimp poses as a client in order to kidnap and beat Jessica up – he then offers Z $20,000 to buy Jessica, which Z answers by shooting him in the face.

The next day, Jarrett pleads with Jessica to leave Florida with him and Zola – she refuses, so Jarrett tries to kill himself by jumping off the balcony of Z's fourth-floor apartment.

""He f***ing jumped,"" Zola tweeted. ""I screamed SO LOUD my heart stopped.""

Thankfully, he didn't plunge to his death, however, because ""he was stuck by his pants"", Zola explains.

Zola and Jarrett fly back to Detroit, and then a few days later Zola gets a call from Las Vegas.

It's Jessica, saying she's been arrested for selling sex and discovered ""Z was wanted for kidnapping 15 underage girls & is linked to 6 murders"".

Zola's thread ends with her saying Jessica ""played victim"", adding that Z ""got sentenced to life"" while Jessica was back in Detroit with her mother and child.

Sex trafficking reality

Zola's incredible story quickly blew up online but, unsurprisingly, accounts from the real people involved differed as to what had really happened.

Rolling Stone interviewed Zola shortly after her thread went viral and she freely admitted she'd embellished reality for dramatic effect.

Jarrett's dramatic suicide attempt and Z shooting the other pimp were completely made up, as was Z having sex with Jessica in front of Jarrett to humiliate him.

And Zola also denied claims that she too sold sex on the trip, but insisted what happened was broadly true.

The truth was actually a dark story about sex trafficking.

Z was really a Nigerian man named Akporode “Rudy” Uwedjojevwe, who met Jessica Rae Swiatkowski one night after she was raped in a strip club.

He was soon exploiting her too, including by forcing her into coercing others into ""trapping"".

A woman he raped reported the attack to the police who arrested him.

“I was helping other girls be put into that situation,” Jessica told Rolling Stone in 2015, “and as someone who’s been sexually abused, why would I do that?

""All I can say is that I was literally brainwashed by Rudy.”

11 Jessica's name is changed to Stefani in the forthcoming film, played by Riley Keoug Credit: A24

In 2017, Rudy was sentenced to 16 years in prison for sex trafficking and coercion, Kolo-TV reports.

Now 40, he's still behind bars at the High Desert State Prison in California.

Zola said she hoped her Twitter story, which she posted and deleted twice before it went viral, would raise awareness about sex trafficking.

“For whatever reason, people feel like it doesn’t happen, not in their world at least,” she said. “But it does.”

'Real-life superhero'

Now Zola's story is getting a new lease of life on the big screen.

It stars Taylour Paige as Zola and Riley Keough as Jessica, whose name is changed in the film to Stefani.

Euphoria star Colman Domingo plays Z.

James Franco was originally signed on to direct the film but left the project in 2018 following allegations of sexual misconduct.

Janicza Bravo directed instead, saying she was drawn to Zola's character.

""What drew me most was her voice,"" Bravo told Deadline last year.

The campaign for the new law is being backed by Nimco Ali, a feminist campaigner appointed by the Home Secretary to advise on the Government’s new strategy to combat sexual violence against women and girls.

It comes as a survey by UN Women UK revealed the shocking statistics that 97 per cent of women aged between 18 and 24 have been the victims of sexual harassment.

Writing for The Telegraph, Ms Ali slammed current loopholes in the law that allows women and girls to be the targets for illicit sexual and abusive comments from men and unwanted behaviour of a sexual nature.

“Street harassment is absolutely a form of violence towards women and girls and it currently goes unreported and unpunished. Tolerating behaviour like public harassment only makes it easier for serious crimes of physical and sexual violence to happen,” she said.

“Change is possible – I know this because through my and others' work campaigning to end FGM (Female Genital Mutilation), it is now a tangible reality that FGM will end in my lifetime.”

A Home Office source said the proposal was ""being looked at"" as part of the sexual violence strategy, which will be published in the autumn.

On Thursday, Downing Street said the strategy was a priority Government to “better target perpetrators and support victims of these crimes”.

Home secretary Priti Patel said: ""Many women have shared their stories and concerns online since Sarah’s disappearance last week.

“These are so powerful because each and every woman can relate. Every woman should feel safe to walk on our streets without fear of harassment or violence.

""At this deeply sad and tragic time as we think and pray for Sarah and her family, I will continue through my role to do all I can to protect women and girls from violence and harassment.""

CHANGE IS POSSIBLE

Loopholes in current laws mean there is no specific offence for sexually harassing women verbally in the street.

The Public Order Act 1986 does not mention sexual harassment and doesn't refer to crimes with any sexual element.

The Protection from Harassment Act of 1997 requires a “course of conduct” that does not cover the vast majority of street comments or abuse which are one-off and opportunistic.

The Sexual Offences Act of 2003 largely requires physical contact.

Ms Ali added: ""Street sexual harassment should be a criminal offence.

“It is illegal to spit your chewing gum out on to the floor in public. You get fined.

""We have laws for drink driving and wearing seat belts. But to say to a 14 year old girl: ‘Come over here and do explicit things,’ is not a crime.

“You can’t be safe if people can be saying these kinds of things to a woman let alone children. Why can’t we take steps to make women feel as safe as men on the street?”

Sarah, 33, vanished after leaving a friend's house in Clapham, South London, to walk back to her home in Brixton on March 3.

Detectives investigating her disappearance have arrested a Metropolitan Police officer, Wayne Couzens, from Kent.

Met Police commissioner Dame Cressida said human remains have been found in a woodland area near Ashford, Kent.

However, detectives have not yet been able to confirm the identity of the remains and said it is likely to take 'a significant time'.

In the UN Women UK survey, it also showed that for women who weren't between 18 and 24, 80 per cent had experienced sexual harassment.

The women questioned also expressed a lack of faith in the police and their ability to be taken seriously and the abuse dealt with.

Ms Ali added: ""Street sexual harassment should be a criminal offence. It is illegal to spit your chewing gum out on to the floor in public. You get fined. We have laws for drink driving and wearing seat belts. But to say to a 14 year old girl: ‘Come over here and do explicit things', is not a crime. Nimco Ali

“This is a human rights crisis. It’s just not enough for us to keep saying ‘this is too difficult a problem for us to solve’ – it needs addressing now,” said Claire Barnett, executive director of UN Women UK.

“We are looking at a situation where younger women are constantly modifying their behaviour in an attempt to avoid being objectified or attacked, and older women are reporting serious concerns about personal safety if they ever leave the house in the dark – even during the daytime in winter.”

A campaign for the new offence titled Our Streets Now has been set up by sexual harassment victims sisters Gemma, 16, and Maya Tutton, 22.

They want serious sexual offences to be prioritised for a slot in Britain’s backlogged courts.

The demand comes amid a national outcry over the threats posed to women following the killing of Sarah Everard.

Ellie Reeves, Labour’s Shadow Solicitor General, said the government has “let down victims”.

She said: “A decade of failure has weakened the foundations of our criminal justice system, leading to a near total collapse in rape prosecutions and delays of years getting to trial.

“Many survivors feel the system is working against them, not for them, and that is completely the wrong way round.”

Just 1.4 per cent of rape allegations are prosecuted, shocking official stats show.

This is the lowest on record.

Furious campaigners have warned that many victims are staying silent about their abuse because they have lost faith in the courts.

England’s courts now have a backlog of some 56,000 cases.

Sarah, 33, disappeared after leaving a friend's house in Clapham, South London, on the evening of Wednesday, March 3.

She was last seen on CCTV walking alone at about 9.30pm. Human remains discovered in woodland in Ashford, Kent, have been confirmed as Sarah's.

Police have charged serving Met Police officer Wayne Couzens with Sarah's kidnap and murder.

Her death sparked events across the country, with thousands attending in-person and virtual vigils in her memory, and as a way of publicly urging for women's safety on the UK's streets.

But one event in Clapham turned ugly when a Met Police officer shoved a woman to the floor.

And hundreds of protesters gathered at the Met's headquarters today after cops stormed the vigil.

In a horrific attack that bears striking similarities to the infamous New Delhi bus attack, the victim was raped by her attacker and then abused further with an iron rod.

The accused, Yogilal Rahangdale, 52 ⁠— who works as a supervisor at the spinning mill where the victim is employed ⁠— also lived with the woman, her brother and another woman at a rented accommodation in the Pardi area in Nagpur.

On the night of the chilling attack on January 21, the victim and Rahangdale were left alone at the house when he cruelly attacked her.

But, as she resisted, Rahangdale callously stuffed a wad of cloth into her mouth and she fell unconcious.

He is then alleged to have raped her and used an iron rod to disgustingly sexually abuse her further.

The victim told her brother about the attack three days afterwards and he accompanied her to the police station, NDTV reported.

The disturbing detail about the insertion of the iron rod is similar to the New Delhi bus attack in 2012 during which six men gang-raped a 23-year-old woman and caused organ damage by penetrating her with an iron rod.

New Delhi bus attack The 2012 Delhi gang rape case involved a rape and fatal assault that occurred on 16 December 2012 in Munirka, a neighbourhood in South Delhi. The incident took place when a 23-year-old female physiotherapy intern Jyoti Singh was beaten, gang raped, and tortured in a private bus in which she was travelling with her friend, Awindra Pratap Pandey. There were six others in the bus, including the driver, all of whom raped the woman and beat her friend. Eleven days after the assault she was transferred to a hospital in Singapore for emergency treatment but died two days later. The incident generated widespread national and international coverage and was widely condemned, both in India and abroad

Earlier this month, two of the men who participated in the barbaric assault, Vinay Sharma and Mukesh Singh, lost a final appeal to have their death sentences quashed.

The supreme court's ruling comes amid a revived debate over sexual violence in India after several headline-grabbing cases in recent weeks.

A woman in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh was doused with gasoline and set on fire by five men, including two she had accused of gang rape and who were out on bail, on her way to attend a court hearing in her case.

She died earlier this month at a hospital in New Delhi.

WE ARE relieved that the Brit girl in the gang-rape case is now safe at home in the UK. But her suspended sentence can hardly be called justice.

The teenager was treated appallingly by the Cypriots. The police denied her a lawyer. The Mayor of Ayia Napa threatened to sue her unless she withdrew the rape allegations. And the judge conducting her trial refused to hear crucial evidence.

Now, her harrowing diaries reveal just how much she suffered at their hands.

If the British Government is to prevent others going through a similar ordeal, it must act without delay.

First, the Prime Minister must throw his full weight behind her brave appeal to clear her name.

If that doesn’t work, the Foreign Office should make no bones about advising Brits not to travel to Cyprus.

Why? Because the island clearly needs a kick up the backside to reform its broken legal system. And a financially devastating exodus of British tourists would provide exactly that.

We don’t believe it’s at all likely that a woman would consent to sex with a dozen strangers. And if you accept that, then it’s crystal clear this young woman has been the victim of a shocking and preventable miscarriage of justice.

Our government has a moral duty to stand by her side.

Which is why we’re delighted that the Government is stepping in.

Under our new, improved post-Brexit immigration system, foreign workers prepared to plug jobs that don’t interest British nationals will be prioritised.

And those looking to undercut our eager workers will be sent packing.

Big companies that have grown used to taking shortcuts are in for a shock.

But the lives of ordinary working Brits will be improved immeasurably.

The businesswoman previously took to her page to state a ""tornado"" was coming to ""destroy everything"" hours before the 33-year-old was booked for the serious offenses.

Mom Amy then exclusively opened up to The Sun telling how she was ""devastated"" by Josh's child porn charges, which he has denied.

Josh, who is married to Anna Duggar, was charged with one count of possession of a child pornographic photo and a second count of receiving a child pornographic photo on Friday.

The charges came after he was arrested on Thursday in Arkansas.

At his arraignment in court on Friday, Josh pleaded not guilty to the charges, and was ordered to remain in custody until at least May 5.

Amy, 34, today posted a new message that added more fuel to the fire among her Twitter followers, depicting a sad Emoji face and a gif of a raindrop or tear falling into a pond.

The droplet was seen causing a huge amount of ripples - perhaps referencing the wide-ranging after-effects of Josh's arrest.

Josh's brother-in-law Derick Dillard has already appeared to agree with fans claiming TLC show Counting On, which stars Josh's family but not Josh, should be scrapped.

Amy's followers appeared divided with the meaning of her picture-post, with some believing the teardrop was a representation of her own sadness.

Another posted: ""Prayers for you and your family. 🙏.""

One then replied: ""Sending so much love and support yalls way.""

Yet one took the opposite stance, and commented: ""Hopefully his family doesn’t try to sweep this one under the rug.""

Amy previously exclusively told The Sun she is “devastated” by the arrest on Friday.

She said: “At the moment I have no comment to make. I’m kind of speechless, we just hope it’s not true.

“I spoke with several of my cousins after we heard about the arrest. We’re in shock, but we don’t want to think the worst of someone, you want to think the best.

“If it is true it would absolutely devastate a lot of people.”

Amy, who is married to Dillon King, continued: “Everybody that knows Josh would be devastated. Just thinking about it makes me want to have a glass of wine right now.”

She added that her “hugs” go out to Josh’s pregnant wife Anna, 32, and their six children.

The clothing boutique owner ended: “It breaks my heart. Family is family and I wish the best for everyone.”

The Duggar family additionally released a statement that read: “We appreciate your continued prayers for our family at this time. The accusations brought against Joshua today are very serious.

""It is our prayer that the truth, no matter what it is, will come to light, and that this will all be resolved in a timely manner.

""We love Josh and Anna and continue to pray for their family.”

According to the indictment, Josh “knowingly received child pornography” between or about May 14, 2019 and on or about May 16, 2019.

For the second count, Josh “knowingly possessed material that contained images of child pornography,” including “images of minors under the age of 12.”

But after an ordeal that lasted for years, she spoke to police - and John, 46, is finally behind bars.

Maria, who has courageously waived her anonymity to speak out, said that as a child she ""loved"" playing with her brother.

But in 1988, when she was just seven and John 14, the sick abuser raped her in the bathroom of the family's home.

""He always called me his special girl,"" she said.

""While I was off school and in the bath, John snuck into the bathroom.

""Suddenly, he lifted me out of the water and placed me on the bathroom floor. Then he raped me.""

Maria said she wept in agony during the attack.

""I cried in pain,"" she said.

""Afterwards, John told me to keep it our little secret.

""I was terrified he’d hurt me again, so I didn’t tell anyone.""

But six months later, John awoke Maria in the middle of the night and attacked her again.

""This time, he kept whispering that I was his special girl,"" she said.

""I was petrified.""

During the next few years, John raped Maria every week in her bedroom while her parents slept in the next room.

She said: ""Every time John attacked me, he gave me sweets afterwards.

""He always told me it was our game.

""I was so young, I just thought it was what brothers did to their sisters.

""I was too afraid to tell my parents.""

Even when John moved out of the family home to get married, his abuse continued.

Maria said: ""He still came over every few weeks and attacked me.

""My life was hell.

""It was carried until I was 15 when John moved away with his wife.""

Maria finally reported her brother to police in 2000 - but it took 20 years to see justice.

John was convicted of assault and rape to injury, one count of assault and rape, one count of indecent assault, and two counts of indecent conduct in October 2020.

He was also found guilty of multiple sexual offences against two other victims.

A judge jailed him for seven years for the attacks.

""It took 20 years to convict him as other victims came forward, but I have my justice,"" Maria said.

Mr Johnson will today chair a meeting of the Crime and Justice Taskforce to look at ways to make Britain’s streets more safe.

Home Secretary Priti Patel is expected to attend the meeting along with Dame Cressida Dick and Director of Public Prosecutions Max Hill.

The PM will use the meeting to discuss the government’s strategy on preventing violence against women, rape prosecutions and the criminal justice system.

'DEEPLY CONCERNED'

Ahead of the meeting, he said: “Like everyone who saw it I was deeply concerned about the footage from Clapham Common on Saturday night.

“I have spoken with the Metropolitan Police Commissioner who has committed to reviewing how this was handled and the Home Secretary has also commissioned HM Inspectorate of Constabulary to conduct a lessons learned review into the policing of the event.”

Mr Johnson added: “The death of Sarah Everard must unite us in determination to drive out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal justice system work to protect and defend them.”

The Home Secretary said: “With Sarah and her family in my thoughts and prayers, I will continue to do all I can in my role as Home Secretary to protect women and girls.

“Everyone should be free to walk our streets without fear of harassment, abuse or violence.

“The Home Office survey on tackling violence against women and girls has received an unprecedented 53,000 responses since it reopened on Friday and I’d urge everyone to give us their views.”

It came after the organisers of a vigil for Sarah Everard slammed Cressida Dick for ""failing to work"" with them after cops stormed the memorial on Saturday night.

Reclaim These Streets said they were “disappointed” after the Met Commissioner publicly defended the Force’s policing - and said she “would have attended” the vigil had it been “lawful”.

Ms Dick claimed she would have attended the event herself had it been “lawful”, and insisted she was “determined to lead” the Force despite growing calls for her resignation.

Cops were filmed dragging women away from a bandstand as thousands gathered in Clapham, South London, to remember Sarah.

Reclaim These Streets, who lost a High Court battle to hold the event earlier this week, said in a letter to Cressida Dick they had “reached out proactively” to the Met Police to try and hold a Covid-safe event.

They said: “We find it particularly extraordinary that you said you would have attended the vigil yourself had it been lawful.

“The only reason parts what ultimately took place, without our involvement, may have been not lawful (though whether it was or not is unclear) is your Metropolitan Police Force failing to work with the women leading Reclaim These Streets to develop a lawful, proportionate and safe event.”

They also claimed that the Force had “put people at a serious health risk through a lack of Covid-safe marshalling and at risk of being manhandled, fined and arrested by your officers”.

At yesterday's protest, cops erected barriers around New Scotland Yard, while some demonstrators spilled onto the road, chanting: ""Shame on you.""

Photos showed demonstrators, some holding homemade placards denouncing the police, gathering this afternoon.

In a statement, the Fire Brigades Union also condemned the tactics used by the Met.

A spokesman said: ""These grotesque displays have no place in our society.

""We send solidarity to the family and friends of Sarah Everard and all those who want to end violence against women and girls.""

It comes as:

In a message posted on Twitter yesterday, the demonstration organisers said: ""Tonight we attempted to have a peaceful vigil to mourn Sarah Everard and protest all forms of gendered violence.

""The police were violent towards us and prevented us from mourning. So tomorrow, we will gather at New Scotland Yard, 4pm. Join us.

""#ReclaimTheseStreets""

The group accused police of having ""abused"" their powers and demanded an end to the Police, Crime and Sentencing bill, which was introduced to the Commons last week.

Trouble flared yesterday as cops arrested four protesters amid ugly scenes that marred the event.

Ms Dick was locked in crisis talks with Boris Johnson, Home Secretary Priti Patel, and London Mayor Sadiq Khan throughout the day.

KHAN DEMANDS PROBE

In a blistering attack, Mr Khan said he was “not satisfied with the explanation” he was given and ordered two separate investigations into the heavy handed tactics.

The Home Secretary has also asked the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Sir Tom Winsor, to investigate.

During the afternoon, hundreds of mourners - including Kate Middleton - had laid flowers and paid respectful tribute to Sarah in a dignified display of grief and solidarity.

The Duchess of Cambridge yesterday laid daffodils picked from the garden at Kensington Palace at the shrine.

But as dusk fell the atmosphere darkened as tensions rose when heavy-handed cops dragged women away from a candle-lit shrine.

In chaotic scenes, scuffles broke out between police and mourners in the 1,500 crowd who had massed around the bandstand.

Some shouted “shame on you” at officers as they ripped women off the metal railings.

Shocking pictures showed one 5ft 2in mourner being pinned to the floor as she was arrested and others cuffed as they were led away.

The stand-off escalated further as officers moved in to arrest a protester on the bandstand.

Police making the arrest were surrounded by an angry mob who pursued them out of the park.

Patsy Stevenson was arrested during the vigil, and said it was ""disgraceful"" that cops broke up what she said was a ""peaceful protest"".

Dramatic pictures showed a masked Ms Stevenson being held on the ground by two officers as she was handcuffed.

'DISGRACEFUL'

Ms Stevenson told Counterfire: ""I was arrested by police for standing there. I wasn’t doing anything, they threw me to the floor.

""They have pictures of me on the floor being arrested. I’m 5ft 2 and I weigh nothing.""

Last night, Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey called for Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick to ""consider"" her leadership of the force.

He branded the scenes ""a complete abject tactical and moral failure on the part of the police"".

Home Secretary Ms Patel has called for a ""full report"" from the Met Police into the clashes on the Common.

She wrote on Twitter: ""Some of the footage circulating online from the vigil in Clapham is upsetting.

""I have asked the Metropolitan Police for a full report on what happened.

""My thoughts remain with Sarah’s family and friends at this terrible time.""

London mayor Sadiq Khan called the police response ""neither appropriate nor proportionate"".

It comes just months after Dame Cressida admitted Extinction Rebellion demonstrations caught out the Met, with officers seen dancing alongside the eco-protesters.

In a lengthy statement, Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball claimed officers were faced with a “very difficult decision” as crowds became “packed tightly together, posing a very real risk of easily transmitting Covid-19.”

She said: ""Those who gathered were spoken to by officers on a number of occasions and over an extended period of time.

""We repeatedly encouraged those who were there to comply with the law and leave. Regrettably, a small minority of people began chanting at officers, pushing and throwing items.

""After speaking with officers, the vast majority of people quickly left. Four arrests have been made for public order offences and for breaches of the Health Protection Regulations.”

The top cop added: ""We absolutely did not want to be in a position where enforcement action was necessary. But we were placed in this position because of the overriding need to protect people’s safety.

""Let me end by saying that across the Met, we review every single event that we police to see if there are lessons that can be learnt. This one will be no different.""

The Victims Commissioner Dame Vera Baird has outlined the proposals in a landmark policy paper to protect victims of crime.

2 Dame Vera Baird has outlined proposals for rape victims to be entitled to free lawyers to stop police probing into their personal lives Credit: PA:Press Association

She wants to see lawyers protect rape victims from having their private lives delved into by investigations.

The paper also says courts should pay victims compensation immediately after the criminal process finishes - with authorities left to chase up the cash from offenders.

Dame Vera said: “Victims are participants from start to finish, but they are currently treated more like bystanders.”

She is calling for new laws which protect the rights of people afflicted by the horrors of crime in the new “Victims Law.”

The Government are set to start consulting on the proposed legislation in the coming months.

Dame Vera said: “We know victim confidence in our criminal justice system is in sharp decline.

""More and more victims are withdrawing their support for prosecutions and, in my recent survey of rape complainants, only around one in seven said they felt reporting could end in justice.

“Superficial changes are not enough if we are to reverse this downward trend. To regain the trust of victims, we urgently need a change of culture in how the justice system treats them.”

Under her proposals she wants rape victims to have a legal right to a lawyer when it’s felt the victims’ right to privacy is threatened by undue data requests by the police, prosecutors or courts.

Victims should also be allowed to make representations when a case is about to be dropped.

And those blighted by anti-social behaviour should also be recognised as victims of crime and access to support services.

She added: “We must recognise justice cannot be delivered without victims and our justice system needs to reflect this.

“I’m calling for a redefinition of the victim that moves beyond treating them as simply an onlooker or maybe a witness, but as a recognised participant, with statutory rights to be informed, supported and to be able to make informed choices.

“This does not in any way undermine the rights of the defendant and does not make them a party to proceedings, or a decision-maker, but it does confirm victims as active contributors in their own right to the criminal justice process.”",['Jonathan Reilly'],"RAPE victims should be entitled to free lawyers to stop coppers probing into their personal lives.

Tina Eyre, 62, a former legal secretary from Gloucester, was reportedly attacked with a spade by her 26-year-old partner - who then used it to dig her grave in the backgarden of her home near Sofia, Bulgaria.

Her cousin Jacqueline Gresham told The Sun Online: “It’s absolutey horrific and the family is just in disbelief and has not taken in what has happened.

“Tina had retired to Bulgaria after moving to Hong Kong from the UK and was living a new life, a dream life on a farm with animals. She hadn't been back home for years but was in regular Facebook contact with her mum.

“We are all so shocked. I have fond memories of her and I used to go and stay with her in Gloucester as a little girl. She was really nice, a lovely person.”

Jacqueline, who is in her 50s and from Derby, explained Tina’s dad Tony is desperately trying to travel to Bulgaria to “find out exactly what happened to his daughter and to repatriate her body.”

She said that Tony, who is separated from Tina’s mum, “needs to be over there to communicate with the authorities face to face.”

She added: “I only found out about the murder from Tony, my uncle, and he’s trying to get out there.

""But he needs to get a passport first, he’s not been abroad before, so there’s a lot that needs to be sorted. There’s been a lot of speculation but we don’t know exactly how she died.""

Tina, a divorcee with no children and also known as Roxanne, was found dead in a pool of blood in a barn at her home in Veliko Tarnovo, after neighbours became worried about her.

She had not been seen for several days and had not responded to phone calls from the local post mistress, who alerted the local mayor.

Two other Brit expats who lived nearby were asked to check on Tina but when they arrived they reportedly found her boyfriend digging a hole in her garden.

When questioned, he said that the owner had asked him to look after her three dogs. But after running off through neighbouring gardens her body was found in the grounds.

It is believed he was digging her grave with the same spade he had used to kill her, according to local police reports.

The suspect from the neighbouring village Gorna Oryahovitsai was arrested and admitted to murder saying he acted out of ""jealousy”.

Another cousin Robert Eyre recalled Tina as “a very bubbly, nice, friendly person.”

He said: “This has rocked out family. I only found out she had been murdered yesterday by one of my relatives.

""Her dad and my dad are brothers. I hadn't seen her in recent years because she had emigrated to Hong Kong and then moved to Bulgaria.

“I think the last time I saw her was when I got married in 1989 and she came to my wedding. I didn’t know her well but it’s still come as a shock. You don't expect that to happen.”

Train driver Robert from Derby added: “Tina has four brothers who are all in the Gloucester area. I know she bought a house with a fair bit of land in Bulgaria and kept animals and enjoyed that lifestyle.

""She had been married here but she and her husband had split up and gone their own ways. I don’t know anything about a new partner she may have had.""

Tina had a successful 17-year career working for top international law firm Clifford Chance and the job led her to a new life in Hong Kong.

But after retiring she chose a completely contrasting way of life and moved to the Balkan state in late 2017.

Officer Nicholas Reardon opened fire on 16-year-old Bryant, who had been wielding a knife just seconds after he arrived on the scene in Columbus, Ohio, according to police footage.

The teenager drew the weapon during an altercation on the street with two other females the same day as Derek Chauvin's guilty verdict.

Cops say they received a disturbance call from a person who said someone was trying to stab them at 4.32pm, with officers arriving on scene minutes later at 4.44pm.

Reardon, was a graduate of Bishop Watterson Catholic school in Columbus and was a member of the school's wrestling team, according to Daily Beast.

The school posted updates on his progress whilst he attended Air Force basic combat training.

According to those updates, he graduated from the training in August 2017 before attending the military's Security Forces Tech School at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas.

The paper discovered a photograph of Reardon in his uniform at the time, which indicated he had completed training within a rank of Airman First Class.

The paper discovered a photograph of Reardon in his uniform at the time, which indicated he had completed training within a rank of Airman First Class.

Daily Beast also discovered he appears to be the son of retired Sergeant Edward Reardon.

Reardon Snr. worked with the Columbus Division of Police for 32 years and according to the publication, is an Air Force veteran.

He served as the Columbus Police Academy's basic training sergeant.

He retired last year and was honoured at an Ohio State Football game by one of his pals whose tweet was announced: ""I am very proud of my friend Sgt. Ted Reardon who was recognized at today's Ohio State Football game.

""I have served with him in the USAF 1984-1987 and @ColumbusPolice 1993-to present.

""May God bless him and his family!""

The Columbus Dispatch noted that Reardon Jr. followed in his father's footsteps and joined the police department in December 2019.

Police bodycamera video from the incident, released by Columbus police on Wednesday, showed two females arguing, as one was thrown to the ground.

The girl standing appeared to have a weapon in her hand – which police said was a knife – and moved against a vehicle with another female.

As the pair moved toward the vehicle, the girl who cops say had a blade raised her arm.

Someone could be heard yelling ""Get down!"" multiple times as an officer immediately pulled out his gun and fired repeated shots.

The girl then collapsed on the ground.

A police spokesperson said at a press conference that officers administered immediate CPR and aid ""as per policy.""

The police-involved shooting happened in Ohio just before Chauvin was found guilty on all counts in the death of George Floyd.

Cops have yet to reveal who the victim was – but she was identified by family as 16-year-old Ma'khia Bryant, WBNS reported.

Hazel Bryant, who said she is Ma'khia's aunt, said her niece called police because several adult women had come to the foster home where she was living and started an altercation with her, The Daily Beast reported.

She told The Columbus Dispatch that her niece got into an altercation with someone who lived at the home.

Hazel claimed that Ma'khia had a knife – and although she dropped it, she was shot multiple times, reports The Columbus Dispatch.

""She didn’t deserve to die like a dog in the street,"" Bryant said, as reported by The Daily Beast.

Mom Paula Bryant described her daughter as a ""sweet child"" who was on the honor roll at school.

The younger Flores was charged with first-degree murder after being arrested last week for the 1996 case, while his father was charged as an accessory.

San Luis Obispo County District Attorney Dan Dow said that he believes Paul Flores, 44, committed the murder during an attempted rape over Memorial Day Weekend in 1996.

The younger Flores was reportedly the last person to see 19-year-old Smart before she disappeared.

He had offered to walk her home from an off-campus frat party at California Polytechnic State University.

Smart never made it home that night, and was reported missing three days later.

During a press conference last week, prosecutors explained that they believe the younger Flores killed her during an attempted rape, but would not say how or where they believed the alleged murder took place.

They did say the suspect's ""dorm room"" on the California campus was a ""crime scene.""

Prosecutors also said they believe Ruben Flores, now 80, helped his son dispose of Smart's remains and cover up the crime scene.

Smart was found passed out on a lawn on the day of her disappearance around 2.30am, and several students had attempted to wake her.

It was then that Flores offered to walk her home. Police have suspected him from the start.

7 The pair appeared in court via Zoom on Monday Credit: AP

Flores, who was also 19 at the time of Smart's disappearance, claimed that he walked her back to her down and dropped her off around the block from it.

He then went back to his own dorm on the same campus, he said.

Police have long questioned the suspect's account of the night's events, and recently acquired evidence that put them in a position to make the arrests.

""Significant information has come in over the past two years, and in the past month ... We believe there’s a location where Kristin Smart was taken,"" DA Dow said last week.

The Flores pair first appeared in court on Thursday, but their attorneys requested that the arraignment be postponed until Monday afternoon.

The rampage started on September 19 after it's claimed Johnson smashed several parked cars at Wyandanch train station between 1am and 3am.

Johnson then allegedly broke into a woman's home in Wyandanch where he raped and strangled her, and stole money as he left, Daily Mail reports.

Suffolk County district attorney Timothy Sini said the woman installed several security cameras in and around her house after the sick attack.

Two days later, Johnson allegedly broke into the property and attacked the woman for a second time.

The woman found the cameras had been damaged and the wires to the recording unit inside the house had been cut.

But footage taken before the cameras were damaged allegedly showed Johnson at the house wearing clown face paint.

Cops identified Johnson from the surveillance video and he was arrested.

The authorities said DNA tests confirmed he was inside the house.

""This is an extremely disturbing case,"" Sini said at court on Wednesday.

""As alleged in the indictment, this defendant went on a crime spree that escalated from breaking car windows to breaking into the victim's home twice in the span of 72 hours, raping and repeatedly strangling the victim while threatening her life.

""This is a dangerous individual and a convicted sex offender who is now off our streets thanks to the excellent work of the Suffolk County Police Department and Assistant District Attorney Ferron Lien.""

Magson, 28, of Leicester, killed the 26-year-old with a single stab wound to the heart.

She delayed getting help, hiding the 11.5cm blade in a neighbour's bin, taking his blood-stained t-shirt indoors, and changing her clothes.

She waited 45 minutes before ""calmly"" calling 999, and then lied on the phone to the emergency call handler about the gravity of Mr Knight's injuries.

Magson told them ""not to worry"" when they said an ambulance may take a while because it was a busy Bank Holiday weekend.

In the bodycam footage, taken when help arrived, Magson shouts that she ""doesn't care"" what happened to her partner ""as long as he's alive"".

She becomes increasingly agitated, yelling ""I want my boyfriend"" while banging on the front door during the attack in March 2016.

Magson was jailed for life with a minimum of 17 years at Birmingham Crown Court today following a retrial ordered by the Court of Appeal.

James Knight was stabbed in the heart by Magson in March 2016

She denied murdering Knight at her first trial, claiming it was self defence, but was convicted later that year and sentenced to life with a minimum term of 17 years.

However, the Court of Appeal ordered a retrial in a judgment handed down in January last year.

It came after the court heard new psychiatric evidence showing the defence of diminished responsibility would have been available to Magson at her first trial.

Her barrister Clare Wade QC said at that hearing that Magson's diagnosis of emotionally unstable personality disorder ""provides an explanation for her conduct and was a significant contributory factor"".

She said it was arguably ""more likely than not that, at the time of the offence, (Magson) was suffering from diminished responsibility"".

'COLD, BRUTAL, MANIPULATIVE'

Magson stood trial at Birmingham Crown Court where a jury again found her guilty of Knight's murder, returning a majority verdict, earlier this month.

At the first trial in November 2016, a jury at Leicester Crown Court heard that Magson and Knight had a ""volatile"" relationship and had been in a drunken row in the run-up to the fatal attack.

Magson was described as ""cold, brutal and manipulative"" and was accused of ""sacrificing"" Knight by delaying calling emergency services for around 30 minutes.

Jailing Magson for life today, Mr Justice Jeremy Baker told her: ""I regret I am unconvinced you have, as yet, any real remorse for having caused James Knight's death.""

Her trial heard how Magson and Mr Knight had been out in Leicester city centre at about midnight, and took a taxi home in the early hours of March 27, 2016.

Jurors were told the pair then began arguing and the cab driver asked them to get out of the vehicle.

CCTV footage showed what the judge referred to as evidence of the couple's ""volatile relationship"", when Mr Knight pushed Magson causing her to fall.

Later, at her home, he was heard banging on her front door after they arrived back there.

The judge said: ""I am sure that until the week of his death he had not shown any physical violence towards you.

""On the contrary, I am sure such physical acts of violence which had taken place during your relationship were ones for which you were responsible, including striking him with a hoover pipe, and stabbing him in the chest with an item of cutlery.""

'VOLATILE RELATIONSHIP'

Jurors had heard Magson's previous convictions for violence against others were aggravating factors in this case.

The judge said that these had involved ""punching a girl outside a nightclub in 2011"" and then in separate incidents, the following year, Magson had ""punched and kicked a girl, and put a glass into another girl's face"".

Magson claimed at her retrial she ""hit out"" at Mr Knight in the kitchen when he grabbed her by the throat, after she inadvertently picked up a knife from the sink.

Neighbours were woken by an argument, with one hearing the victim say ""my heart is bleeding"" - and noticed blood on his clothing.

After Mr Knight fell to the ground, the court heard, Magson delayed getting help.

When the victim's brother came to see what was wrong, she ""deceived"" him, telling how his sibling had been ""beaten up by bouncers"", the judge added.

""A continuation of the false account which I am satisfied, was intended to seek to exculpate you for responsibly of his murder,"" said Mr Justice Baker.

The judge said while the ""precise circumstances"" of how Mr Knight came to stabbed ""may never fully be known"", the jury had ""rejected the suggestion this occurred in self defence"".

Mr Justice Baker added: ""I am sure the account which you provided to the police, being strangled by James Knight, is untrue.""

He added: ""I am sure that without any justification, you made a conscience decision to fetch a steak knife from the kitchen and used it to inflict a fatal wound to James Knight's chest, penetrating his body to a depth of 11.5cm as it passed through one of his lungs and his pulmonary artery.""

Two more videos were shown from officers that were on the scene, showing Bryant being shot four times.

One of the officers can be seen taking witnesses to police vehicles while he tapes off the crime scene.

""She came after me with a knife so he got her,"" a witness wearing pink can be heard telling the cop.

A second officer's footage showed him giving medical aid to Bryant as she laid on the floor next to a car.

The teenager could be seen bleeding as another cop appeared to administer CPR, saying ""stay with us Ma'Khia.""

It comes after graphic bodycam footage of the shooting was last night released by officials.

Cops say they were called to the scene by a person who said someone was trying to stab them at 4.32pm, with officers arriving on scene minutes later at 4.44pm

Video showed two girls arguing before a cop shouted ""Get down"" and began firing his weapon multiple times at one of them – just seconds after arriving on-scene.

The white cop, who was identified as Nicholas Reardon, has been placed on administrative leave while police investigate if his actions were justified, Police Chief Michael Woods told The Columbus Dispatch.

Reardon was hired by the force in December 2019.

Hazel Bryant, who said she is Ma'Khia's aunt, said her niece called police because she was being abused by someone at the foster home where she lived, The Daily Beast reported.

A police spokesperson said at a press conference that officers administered immediate CPR and aid ""as per policy.""

Video footage, however, showed police standing nearby for around 10 seconds before moving slowly toward the girl who was shot.

More than half a minute passed before an officer knelt down to check on her and give aid.

The police-involved shooting happened in Ohio just before Chauvin was found guilty on all counts in the death of George Floyd.

Cops have yet to reveal who the victim was – but she was identified by family as 16-year-old Ma'Khia Bryant, WBNS reported.

Hazel Bryant, who said she is Ma'Khia's aunt, said her niece called police because she was being abused by someone at the foster home where she lived, The Daily Beast reported.

She told The Columbus Dispatch that her niece got into an altercation with someone else who lived at the same home.

Hazel claimed that Ma'Khia had a knife – and although she dropped it, she was shot multiple times, reports The Columbus Dispatch.

""She didn’t deserve to die like a dog in the street,"" Bryant said, as reported by The Daily Beast.

Mom Paula Bryant described her daughter as a ""sweet child"" who was on the honor roll at school.

""She was a very loving, peaceful little girl,"" Paula Bryant told WBNS.

She added: ""Ma'Khia had a motherly nature about her. She promoted peace.""

""That's something that I want to always be remembered.""

A spokesperson for Franklin County Children's Service told the Columbus Dispatch that Bryant had been in foster care, but did not comment further.

Police responded to reports of an attempted stabbing, WSYX reported.

A victim was taken to a nearby hospital in critical condition, according to the outlet, but they were pronounced dead shortly before 5.30pm.

Social media reports initially said that the victim was a 15-year-old black female.

Video shared on social media apparently showed a person lying on the ground as police sood nearby.

The Columbus Police Department did not respond to The Sun to confirm details on the victim.

Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther said in a series of tweets that details are not all known at this time, but cops were wearing body-cameras.

""This afternoon a young woman tragically lost her life. We do not know all of the details,"" Ginther said in a tweet.

""There is body-worn camera footage of the incident. We are working to review it as soon as possible. BCI is on the scene conducting an independent investigation . . .

""— as they do with all CPD-involved shootings,"" he continued in a separate tweet.

""We will share information that we can as soon as it becomes available.

""I’m asking for residents to remain calm and allow BCI to gather the facts.""

Horrified eyewitnesses said four thugs jumped out of the 4x4 and started stabbing the boy who was left fighting for life in hospital.

Locals said the boy was ""dragged"" along by his bike and fell to the ground before he was attacked.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said five weapons, including two Rambo-style knives, two ""Zombie"" knives and a kitchen knife, were found at the scene.

Abdul Razak, 37, told of the moment he fought to save the teen’s life as he lay in a pool of blood.

He told The Sun Online: “I saw a group of small people surrounding the boy.

ZOMBIE KNIVES

“He was shouting 'mum, mum!' His aunt and mum were by his side and screaming for help.

“His mum said he just came out to test his bike and then they tried to kill him.""

A woman helping Abdul at the scene said four thugs had jumped out of a Land Rover and started knifing him.

Abdul added: “I heard the Land Rover dragged him along by his bike and then he fell off, and they jumped out and started stabbing him.

“I thought how could you do this to a human being?

I heard the Land Rover dragged him along by his bike and then he fell off, and they jumped out and started stabbing him."" Eyewitness Abdul Razak

“There was a lot of blood. A neighbour came out with a towel and told me to press it on the wound with his chest to stop the bleeding.

“I saw three stab wounds, two on his chest and one in his left thigh. But apparently there was more.

“Everyone who was helping was shouting 'come on, you can make it'.

“I was with him for about 15 minutes before the ambulance came.

“When the paramedics got here he was moving more and was able to lift his head up. Then they gave him CPR.

“The whole night and this morning I’ve been struggling to concentrate. I just hope he makes it.”

The Sun Online understands the boy lives near to the scene of the stabbing.

Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: “We came outside after he was stabbed and there was a group of people around him, they were calling for help.

“The boy was lying on the floor and there was a lot of blood.

“He was talking and shouting but then I saw him close his eyes.

His mum came to his side and she was screaming, and then she fainted."" Shocked neighbour

“His mum came to his side and she was screaming, and then she fainted.

“People from the park opposite said the people who did it were driving a Land Rover.”

Cops this afternoon said the boy was in a serious but stable condition in hospital.

Dame Cressida said: “Last night, a 16-year-old boy, having just left home on his bike, as I understand it, was knocked off his bike, it appears, by a car, and then stabbed repeatedly in many different places.

“We recovered from the scene two Rambo knives, two Zombie knives, a kitchen knife.”

5 KNIVES FOUND

Cops are trying to trace the driver of a white van who they believe may have witnessed the stabbing.

Detective Inspector Yasser Awad, who is leading the investigation, said: “This violent attack has left a teenage boy in hospital with serious injuries.

“We believe there may be people who saw what happened to him but have not yet come forward.

“The attack took place in a residential area and many people will have been in their homes due to the ongoing lockdown – if you heard a commotion or saw anything suspicious, we want to hear from you.

The boy was lying on the floor and there was a lot of blood.""

Neighbour

“In particular, we want to speak to the driver of a white van which was on Henry Road between 6.15pm and 6.20pm. We believe the driver may have vital information.”

Just 40 minutes after the Brixton attack, a 19-year-old boy was stabbed in Stratford, East London.

He also remains in a critical condition in hospital. No arrests have been made.

Police are urging anyone with information to contact them immediately quoting CAD 6614 for the Stratford stabbing and CAD 6277/23Feb for the Brixton attack.

Cops named the victim of the murder as 21-year-old Tyreke Watson.

Witnesses said a ""tiny teen"" ambushed the victim at 4pm outside a Cash Converters on West Green Road - yards from the sport where a 17-year-old was murdered a month ago.

Detective Chief Inspector Linda Bradley, leading the investigation, said: “Tyreke’s family have been left completely devastated by his death and I would urge anyone who witnessed the attack or who has any other information about this case to contact police.”

A source exclusively told The Sun that the 32-year-old - who is pregnant with their seventh child - even accompanied Josh to the police station when he turned himself in.

Josh was taken into custody on federal charges on Thursday afternoon following a 2019 Homeland Security raid on his now-shuttered used car dealership.

An insider claimed Anna is continuing to support Josh throughout the scandal and has no plans to divorce him.

""Anna is standing by her husband as she always has,"" a source said.

""She even accompanied Josh to Fayetteville on Thursday so he could turn himself in to authorities.""

The insider added: ""Josh and Anna asked the family to pray for them, and said that they love them.""

Josh's arrest comes just six years after claims the shamed ex-reality star molested five girls as a teen.

That year, In Touch Weekly uncovered a 33-page Arkansas police report claiming Jim Bob confessed to local authorities that his eldest son fondled young girls while they were asleep in the Duggar family home back in 2002.

The In Touch report also claimed that in 2006, the Arkansas Child Abuse Hotline received a tip that there was abuse happening in the Duggar household, and the Springdale Police Department reached out to the family for interviews.

Following the bombshell 2015 report, Josh addressed the allegations, claiming: ""Twelve years ago, as a young teenager, I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret.""

""I hurt others, including my family and close friends.""

Josh was never charged with any crime related to the incidents.

His sisters Jill and Jessa came forward as victims in an interview with reporter Megyn Kelly, though they insisted they had forgiven Josh for his sins.

In the fallout, the family's reality show 19 Kids & Counting was canceled, and Josh was fired from his position at Christian lobbying group the Family Research Council.

He was not included in the family's later spinoff show, Counting On.

12 Later that year, he admitted to having a 'porn addiction' after getting caught cheating on Ashley Madison Credit: Instagram

But the scandals didn't stop there, as another report just three months later claimed Josh was using adultery dating service Ashley Madison.

Josh said in a statement: ""I have been the biggest hypocrite ever. While espousing faith and family values, I have secretly over the last several years been viewing pornography on the Internet and this has become a secret addiction and I became unfaithful to my wife.""

Soon after, porn star Danica Dillon, whose real name is Ashley Johnston, claimed he assaulted her during a sexual encounter.

In a 2020 interview with The Sun, Ashley, 33, described the alleged incident as being so intense ""it felt like this guy tried to kill me.""

Josh has always denied the alleged assault.

Anna stood by Josh throughout all the scandals and earlier this month, confirmed that she's pregnant with their seventh child.

""It’s a GIRL!!!!!"" she wrote alongside a video of their gender reveal.

""We are overjoyed to announce baby seven is on the way and we can’t wait to hold her in our arms this fall!""

Anna and Josh - who tied the knot in 2008 - are already parents to daughters Mackynzie, 11, Meredith, five, and Maryella, one, and sons Michael, nine, Marcus, seven, and Mason, three.

Anna defended her husband after one follower questioned how they are affording looking after such a large family.

The fan asked: “How do you afford all those kids? Does Josh even work?”

The TV star shot back: “Yes, my husband is a diligent worker and provides well for our family.”

A complaint was filed on behalf of the victims by their mum who stated that her daughters were kidnapped on September 11 by a group of men.

The mum claims that her teenage kids were taken to different locations for six days where they were gang-raped by the suspects.

The men allegedly took photographs of the girls and recorded videos of the vile abuse.

""My daughters were taken to different locations for six days where they were gang-raped by the suspects... who intoxicated my daughters and took indecent photographs and recorded videos of them,"" the police report quoted the mother as saying.

According to a police report, the 15-year-old was later dropped off at Faisalabad's Jhang Bazar while her sister was left at a different location before the suspects fled.

The mother of the two victims says that the family are unable to take legal action against the men on account of poverty.

Instead, the family have left their residence and settled at another location.

However, the suspects have not left the family alone and continue to catcall and record videos of the teenage girls wherever they go.

'WE CANNOT FIGHT THEM'

""We are poor people. We cannot fight them nor can we afford to pay for lawyers. So we have decided to leave our house here and go somewhere else,"" said the mother.

It is the latest case in the rape epidemic that is sweeping across Pakistan, especially in the Punjab province where the two girls were kidnapped.

In September a woman was allegedly gang-raped after being kidnapped while waiting for a bus in Pakistan.

The 22-year-old was kidnapped in Karachi's Clifton, Pakistan on September 23 and was taken to an apartment where she was assaulted, police said.

She is reported to have described how three men in a car abducted her while she waited for a bus to go home.

According to police, after she was raped, the men then dropped her back at the same spot she had been kidnapped from, leaving the her to find her way home.

The attack came days after Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan called for rapists and child molesters to be chemically castrated.

In September a woman was allegedly gang-raped after being kidnapped while waiting for a bus in Pakistan.
The attack came days after Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan called for rapists and child molesters to be chemically castrated.","['taken', 'suspects', 'mob', 'days', 'men', 'monsters', 'abducted', '15', 'evil', 'girls', 'sisters', '17', 'kidnapped', 'different', 'videos', 'mum', 'gangraped', 'pakistan']","{'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=752905198150451&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sunmasthead_mobile-1.png', 'data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" viewBox=""0 0 1.5 1""%3E%3C/svg%3E', 'data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" viewBox=""0 0 1.8 1""%3E%3C/svg%3E', 'https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000616684928.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1200&h=800&crop=1', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==', 'https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/themes/thesun/images/sunmasthead.svg'}",True,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000616684928.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1200&h=800&crop=1,1,,,,,['gang-rape']

The disgraced actor, 34, had been set to star opposite Julia and Sean Penn in the Starz series based on the 1972 Watergate scandal.

Armie - who has been accused of abuse my multiple women - stepped away from the project due to ""scheduling conflicts,"" according to The Hollywood Reporter.

He had been allegedly been slated to portray White House counsel, John Dean, on the show.

Joel Edgerton, who was set to direct the series and star as G. Gordon Liddy - the chief operative of Richard Nixon's ""Plumbers"" unit - has also reportedly left the project.

Armie and Julia previously worked together in 2012 filming fantasy flick Mirror, Mirror – in which he lunges at Julia and licks her neck in one scene.

The scene came about after Julia’s character – an evil queen – used a “puppy love” potion on the Prince – an acting challenge which Armie boasted about in an unearthed interview.

He recalled afterwards: “I got in like five or six good licks. She smelled of apple cinnamon, man...

“I told myself, 'As you’re licking her do not let drool come out of your mouth.”

Sources exclusively told The Sun: “His crush on her is well known and Julia has always had his back too, though strictly as a friend and acting colleague.""

Gaslit is just the latest in a long line of TV and film projects that Armie has dropped out of since multiple women accused him of abusive behavior.

He has also parted ways with The Offer, a series centered around the making of The Godfather and was replaced by Josh Duhamel in Jennifer Lopez's upcoming romcom, Shotgun Wedding.

The Call Me By Your Name star was also dropped by his talent agency, WWE.

Armie first came under fire last month for allegedly sending disturbing messages to multiple women about cannibalism, rape fantasies, having ""slaves"" and ""drinking blood.""

Paige Lorenze , 22, claimed he wanted to remove her bottom ribs so he could eat them and that he carved the letter ""A"" into her pubic bone.

The model - who reportedly dated Armie for four months last year - alleged that he was ""100 percent"" serious about finding a doctor to remove her bottom ribs.

""He was telling me you can remove the bottom ribs so he could smoke them, cook them and eat them. He kept saying, 'You don't need them,'"" she told Star Magazine.

The model said she laughed it off but felt ""anxious and confused"" as a result of his alleged behavior.

She also claimed Armie carved his initial above her pubic bone in an ""extremely painful"" act and later bragged about it to his friends.

Elsewhere, Courtney Vucekovich told the Daily Mail that he wanted to break her rib and eat it.

The app founder said: “He was really into saying he wants to break one of your ribs and eat it. Like barbecue it and eat it.

“In terms of the BDSM stuff, he made that pretty clear that it is something he is interested in very early on in the relationship and he referenced breaking my ribs often.”

Courtney alleged that she felt as if she had been groomed by the actor and needed to undertake a 30-day intensive course of therapy for trauma and PTSD to deal with the repercussions after their breakup in early October.

The anonymous Instagram account, House Of Effie, kickstarted the claims about Armie's disturbing alleged fantasies and behavior.

She claimed they had an affair from 2016 until 2020, while he was still married to Elizabeth Chambers, whom he has two children with.

House Of Effie has shared numerous graphic screenshots and photos reportedly sent from The Social Network star.

One of his alleged messages reads: ""I am 100 percent a cannibal. I want to eat you.""

Another read: ""You just live to obey and be my slave. If I wanted to cut off one of your toes and keep it with me in my pocket so I always had a piece of you in my possession?""

Pals of the teenager found her surrounded by the gang at the holiday apartment

Believe Me includes compelling statements from pals of the girl — called Emily in the show — who witnessed the aftermath of the attack in Ayia Napa last July.

Emily had consensual sex with Israeli holiday fling “Sam”.

But she says his friends then burst into the room and Sam held her as they raped her.

Her pal “Jacob” tells how he arrived at their holiday apartment and found Emily surrounded by the gang.

He recalls: “I said what are you doing? They didn’t reply and started walking away. She’s crying.”

Another friend “Becca” says of Emily: “She was hysterical. I’ve never seen anyone in that sort of state. It was scary.

“I was like, ‘did he (Sam) hurt you?’ And she was like. ‘Yeah, but not just him’.”

In her first TV interview, Emily, 19, confirms cops forced her to retract her statement — which led to her being convicted of a public nuisance.

Her barrister, Lewis Powers slams police failings as a “disgraceful miscarriage of justice”.

Maryam Karimi was hanged for killing her abusive husband with the help of her father.

She was executed at Rasht Central Prison on March 13, after serving 13 years behind bars.

Maryam's daughter, who was six when she killed her husband, took part in the execution after reportedly refusing to forgive her or accept ""Diya"" (blood money), according to Iran International TV.

Maryam was charged with ""retribution in kind"", which is known in Iran as ""Qisas"" - a form of ""an eye for an eye"" retribution.

Qisas requires the victim’s next of kin to be present at the execution and they are actively encouraged to carry out the execution themselves.

A source told Iran Human Rights: ""Maryam’s daughter was six years old when the murder took place and has been in the care of her father’s family.

""For the past 13 years, they had told her that both her parents were dead, but had to tell her the truth a few weeks prior to the execution to prepare her psychologically.”

'INHUMANE AND CRUEL'

Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, director of campaign group, Iran Human Rights, said: “The Islamic Republic laws make a girl whose father was murdered when she was a child, the executioner of her own mother.

""The Islamic Republic is the leading promoter of violence in Iranian society today.”

Following the execution, it is reported that Maryam’s father Ebrahim was brought in by authorities to see her corpse hanging.

However, for unknown reasons the death penalty was not handed down to him.

Activist and journalist at Iran International TV, Aram Bolandpaz said: “Four decades of brain-washing at schools, extreme punishments in Iranian society and a patriarchal regime mean that Maryam's daughter was raised to make sure that executing her mother was a victory for a man, whether that be for her father or for the oppressive regime.

""Qisas is inhumane, savage, and cruel, no matter where in the world.

""For a country which prioritises the rights of unborn babies and emphasises that life is the most valuable phenomenon, how can the Islamic Republic seize a life from someone in such an awful way.”

Qisas is inhumane, savage, and cruel, no matter where in the world. Aram Bolandpaz

The continued use of Qisas in Iran has caused uproar with human rights campaigners.

But the Qisas death sentence was retained for murder in the Iranian Islamic Penal Code in 2019.

Qisas are also in use for juvenile offenders, whilst Sharia law defines the age of criminal responsibility for girls to be nine-years-old, and 15 for boys.

In 2019, 225 executions were carried out as Qisas, reports Iran International TV.

There was 68 being carried out in one prison alone, and four of these executions involving individuals who were juveniles at the time of the offence.

As a plaintiff in Qisas cases, the responsibility of carrying out the execution and the decision on whether the accused should be executed is theirs to make.

But this has been recognised as causing severe psychological distress to plaintiffs and can have long-term psychological consequences.

The use of Qisas has previously sparked calls from the UN over the retribution execution of Navid Afkari the Iranian champion wrestler in 2020.

The UN stated: ""It is deeply disturbing that the authorities appear to have used the death penalty against an athlete as a warning to a population in a climate of increasing social unrest"".

The shadow Cabinet minister spoke out as a Whitehall probe was launched into Britain's elite schools amid fears of a 'rape culture'.

6 Labour shadow Cabinet minister Jess Phillips has admitted she would hand her own son in to the police if she suspected him of carrying out a sexual assault

More than 10,000 reports posted by pupils on a website have exposed the harrowing scale of misogyny, harassment and sexual assault in some schools.

At least 100 schools were named on the the Everyone's Invited site, which was set up by former private-school pupil Soma Sara, 22, to expose 'rape culture' in schools.

Ms Phillips blasted the government for leaving parents ""totally rudderless"" and said parents should hand in their own children if they suspect them of crimes.

The shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding told Times Radio: ""If it is as wide-scale as this website is making clear then there are boys in schools - and it is largely boys - that (parents) need to intervene, including taking their son to the police station.

'RAPE CULTURE' EXPOSED

""If I thought my son, and how I would find out about this I don't know, then, yes, that is absolutely what I would suggest my son should do.""

Schools named on Everyone's Invited include Eton College, St Paul's School, Dulwich College, Westminster School and Highgate School.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has branded the allegations as ""shocking and abhorrent"" amid calls for an inquiry by watchdog Ofsted.

Ms Phillips said: ""I have a 16-year-old son and a 12-year-old son and today I will send them to their local state secondary school and I've been speaking to them about this.

""The reality is that schools, the Government and parents have to look at what is happening over the last couple of weeks, and, in fact many, many years, and look at what they could be doing to make this better.""

Meanwhile, police officers are ramping up efforts to crack down on gender-based violence after thousands of online testimonies revealed a 'rape culture '.

Simon Bailey, who leads the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) on child protection, said he had received ""in excess of 7,000"" reports from people online.

Mr Bailey said the growing school sex scandal has been fuelled by online porn and the sexualisation of women.

Asked how parents should be responding, he told the Today programme: ""If parents are aware that their son or their daughter has been a victim of abuse, please come forward and report the abuse.

""Your son or daughter, their account will be believed and we will deal with it appropriately.

""If as a parent you are aware your son has been responsible for a sexual assault then I think you should again be taking your son to the police and saying, 'look I've now become aware that this is what my son has done''.

But Mr Bailey does not believe the issue is ""exclusive only to private schools"".

When it was put to him if he had concerns that schools had covered up allegations for reputational reasons, Mr Bailey said: ""I don't have any evidence for that at the moment, but I think it's a reasonable assumption.

""It's predictable and it's a reasonable assumption that in some cases, and hopefully it's just a few, but in some cases schools will have made the decision just to deal with the allegations internally, rather than reporting them when they actually should have done.""

He also warned on the website Everyone's Invited, that ""a culture has grown over recent years whereby in the minds of some people it is acceptable to treat young women in particular in a manner that we are now seeing"".

if anything is making you feel frightened or so uncomfortable and upset that you’re adjusting your daily life to avoid it, then let us know. Louisa Rolfe

Describing the scale of the investigation, he said: ""I believe that in excess of 7,000 people have now put testimonies up online and there are lots and lots of victims that will now be thinking about what has happened to them and having conversations with their parents and others about what to do next.""

A Whitehall investigation has been launched into the emerging scandal, with officials from the Department of Education and Home Office leading the response alongside police chiefs and Ofsted.

Government advice on sexual harassment and sexual violence between kids in schools and colleges is also now being revised - and will be in force by the beginning of the next academic year, the Telegraph reports.

Asked about the Prime Minister's thoughts on claims there is a ""rape culture"" in some schools, the PM's official spokesman said: ""We want victims to have the confidence to report crimes and be comforted in knowing that everything will be done to bring offenders to justice.

""Given these allegations, a police helpline will be set up in due course to ensure victims can access advice and support where needed and DfE and the Home Office and the NPCC are in contact, with everyone invited to provide support to those who are reporting abuse and to provide advice on contacting the police if they wish.""

'WE WANT TO KNOW'

It comes as a Scotland Yard chief urged women who are made to feel “uncomfortable” by wolf-whistling and other forms of harassment to report matters to police.

Louisa Rolfe, an assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan police, promised to take all incidents “seriously”, even if they did not constitute a crime.

“I would urge them to report to us,” she said.

“We do take them seriously. While every incident might not have a criminal justice outcome, we want to know about patterns of offending.

“If you said to somebody about wolf-whistling [that they should] report it to police, they might think that’s strange.

""But, actually, if anything is making you feel frightened or so uncomfortable and upset that you’re adjusting your daily life to avoid it, then let us know.”

Rolfe, who leads the force’s strategy on violence against women and girls, made her comments as the force braces itself for criticism from the police watchdog over its handling of the Everard vigil at Clapham Common, south London, on March 13, The Times reports.

She admitted that the recent murder of Sarah Everard and the Met’s heavy-handed tactics at a vigil to mourn her death had resulted in the need to “build confidence” and trust between women and the police.

Cressida Dick, the Met’s first female commissioner, faced calls to resign after images of male officers wrestling women protesters to the ground were published around the world.

Priti Patel, the home secretary, described the scenes as “upsetting” while Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, called them “unacceptable”.

They both asked HM Inspectorate of Constabulary to investigate to see what lessons can be learnt.

Sarah should have made it back to her Brixton home by about 10pm on Wednesday night - but hasn't been since.

And in a ""shocking and deeply disturbing"" update to the case, Scotland Yard last night revealed a police officer had been arrested over Sarah's disappearance.

The cop was arrested at a Kent address and remains in custody.

A woman - believed to be the cop's partner - was also been arrested at the same location on suspicion of assisting an offender. She remains in custody.

Speaking this morning, Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said ""we really hope"" Sarah is still alive as the hunt continued.

He confirmed the officer who had been arrested had not been on duty with the 33-year-old disappeared - but refused to confirm what charge the cop had been arrested on suspicion of.

AC Ephgrave said last night: ""The arrest this evening is a serious and significant development.

""We will continue to work with all speed on this investigation but the fact that the arrested man is a serving Metropolitan Police officer is both shocking and deeply disturbing.

""I understand there will be significant public concern but it is essential that the investigative team are given the time and space to continue their work.""

The Directorate of Professional Standards is aware and Sarah's family has been kept updated of these developments, police said.

Sarah's family today told of their hope after the arrest, with cousin Tom Everard said: “We’re hopeful this development will bring new information; but the police still need help to find Sarah and get her home safely.”

Last night, Met Police and specialist teams began searching secluded wooded areas in Kent.

A police helicopter was seen flying above for around four hours from 1am with dozens of Met specialist search cops and cadaver dogs.

The site, which used to be a golf club and paint-balling course, was blocked off by a police van today, with around another six near the building.

The land is owned by a local who declined to comment about the police raid. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing.

Sarah was last seen on Wednesday night - seen on a doorbell camera on the Poynders Road section of the South Circular - about halfway between her friend's house and her own flat.

Detectives searching for the missing marketing executive earlier cordoned off a main road to search a housing complex close to where Sarah's phone last pinged.

Officers carried out fingertip searches, while divers and sniffer dogs checked ponds and drains in the area.

And police have appealed for motorists who may have driving near her route home to send in their dash-cam footage.

Uber is using smartphone software to pinpoint which of its drivers were in the area when Sarah vanished.

Tracking data is helping to identify if any of the tech giant's 45,000 London cabbies were close to the South Circular Road in Clapham.

Police yesterday released new pictures of missing Sarah hoping that it might encourage anyone with information to come forward.

One shows Sarah wearing the same coat as on the night she went missing.

Her distraught family fear ""bad people approached her"" as her ""very worried"" boyfriend issued a desperate plea.

Sarah’s parents left their York home at the weekend and drove to London to help the search for their daughter.

Neighbours in their quiet cul-de-sac yesterday spoke of their shock at the latest development as officers continued to quiz one of their own.

Her uncle Nick Everard also revealed the family are ""absolutely distraught"" and said the pain is ""getting worse as the days go on"".

He told the Evening Standard: ""I don’t know London well but I fear there could have been some bad people about who approached her.

""The family are searching with Sarah’s friends who have been absolutely amazing.""

He had earlier pleaded with any potential abductor to ""just to be human and to let her come home"".

Nick added: “If someone is holding her against her will I would plead with them just to be human and to let her come home, to let her talk to us, give us a ring or text to let us know she is OK.""

Sarah's boyfriend Josh Lowth, who spoke to Sarah on the phone for around 15 minutes before she vanished, has appealed for information on Facebook.

He wrote: ""Sarah is still missing. Please share this post to help us to find her. Today, more than ever, we miss our strong, beautiful friend.""

A relative also revealed today Josh is ""very worried"" as the search enters its seventh day.

He told MailOnline: ""Josh and Sarah have been very happy together and she’s a lovely girl.

""The whole family is obviously very worried about her and just wants her home safely.

""We’re all pulling together and praying that this awful situation is quickly resolved. We want to thank the media for all their help.""

His dad Chris added: ""We are concerned, like everybody is. We really, really want to see her back.""

It comes after CCTV footage from a local estate agent showed no one matching Sarah's description between 9.30pm and 10.30pm on the route police believe she would have taken home.

The camera has a clear view of both sides of the busy road on Brixton Hill, which is close to the flat where the marketing manager lives alone.

The Met have confirmed they remain ""open-minded"" over Sarah's disappearance.

Murder cops have taken over the investigation but are still treating the case as a missing person inquiry.

DCI Katherine Goodwin said: ""This is definitely a missing person investigation at the moment but I remain open-minded as to all possibilities in the investigation.""

She said 750 people have now been spoken to by officers as they desperately try to find the missing marketing manager.

Police have also trawled through hours of CCTV around Sarah's movements on the night she vanished.

DCI Goodwin said specialist officers had been drafted in from across the Metropolitan Police to help with the investigation and she thanked members of the public who had come forward with information.

She said she had met Sarah's family, adding: ""My heart goes out to them in this most difficult time and they are doing everything that they can in order to help find her along with her friends"".

It is understood detectives investigating her disappearance have been told of assaults on women in the area, reports The Times.

In January, Metropolitan Police received a report of sexual harassment on a young female on Hydethorpe Road, just half a mile from where Sarah was last caught on CCTV.

At the start of February, a woman was witnessed being chased by a man just over a mile away.

Then, just three weeks ago, a 14-year-old girl was followed by a man in a van less than half a mile from where Sarah was last seen.

Meanwhile, other women said they reported groups of men following a woman in neighbouring district Balham.

But Scotland Yard has said it is so far not linking Sarah's disappearance to any other incidents.

It comes after alarmed women living in the area revealed police urged them to be vigilant after the mysterious disappearance.

One said cops knocked on her door last night and warned her ""not to go out alone"" as they desperately try to piece together what happened.

Another woman, aged in her 30s, told The Sun Online: “I was told to be more careful because I live on my own.

“The police came round yesterday and said to be careful.

“I don’t want to leave the house at the moment. You don’t know what happened.

“It makes me very worried. I just can’t believe it.”

Clues to find Sarah Officers are also asking people in the following areas to check doorbell or dashcam footage for any sightings of Sarah: The A205 South Circular around Clapham Common

Cavendish Road

On Wednesday night, Sarah left a friend's house in Leathwaite Road in Clapham about 9pm.

She headed through a back gate onto the A205 South Circular before she is believed to have walked across Clapham Common.

She had spoken to her partner on the phone for about 15 minutes, and has not been heard from since that point, according to her friend Rose Woollard.

Sarah moved to the capital for work around 12 years ago and has a brother, James, and sister, Katie, who also live in London.

Her mum and dad have travelled from their home in York to assist with the search.

Her family said: ""With every day that goes by we are getting more worried about Sarah.

""She is always in regular contact with us and with her friends and it is totally out of character for her to disappear like this.

""We long to see her and want nothing more than for her to be found safe and well.

""We are so grateful to the police and all our friends for all they are doing.

""We are desperate for news and if anyone knows anything about what has happened to her, we would urge you to please come forward and speak to the police.

""No piece of information is too insignificant.""

Sarah’s sister, Katie, added on Facebook: “No words. Please share and contact me if you hear anything.”

Fans have been eagerly awaiting the director's cut of the hit film. Here's who stars in Zack Snyder's Justice League...

5 Justice League is now available to watch on Netflix in the UK

What happens in Justice League?

In Justice League, the story picks up from the end of the last DC Extended Universe instalment in the timeline, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice.

Bruce Wayne, who has just buried his foe-turned-friend Superman, decides to round up a group of superhumans with abilities to create a new order to protect the Earth.

After meeting Diana Prince (Wonder Woman), the duo set off to enlist the other members - The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman.

However, soon after they do, their abilities are needed by a new threat that threatens to destroy the planet and everyone on it.

5 Batfleck is back and he's bringing friends in Justice League

Who is in the cast of Justice League?

Ben Affleck (Batman/Bruce Wayne)

Billionaire businessman Bruce Wayne has found a renewed love of his alter-ego Batman following the events of the last movie.

With his faith in what he does now restored, Batman will be the team leader for his group of superhumans.

This was the second time Ben Affleck starred as Bruce Wayne - the 48-year-old actor is best known for his roles in Hollywood movies such as Gone Girl, Good Will Hunting and Pearl Harbour.

5 Diana Prince leads the charge as Wonder Woman in movie Justice League

Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman/Diana Prince)

Diana is the daughter of Queen Hippotlya and was the first child born on Paradise Island where the immortal Amazons live.

The Greek goddesses created the Amazons by placing the souls of women murdered by men on the island.

But Diana's soul was held back to become Hippotlya's unborn baby.

Gal Gadot is an Israeli actress and model best known for her role as Gisele Yashar in the Fast & Furious franchise.

The Wonder Woman standalone movie became one of the summer blockbusters of 2017.

Jason Momoa (Aquaman/Arthur Curry)

Before Justice League, Jason was known to most as Khal Drogo in Game of Thrones, and Ronon Dex in Stargate.

Jason's character in the movie is a lot darker than the green and yellow spandex wearing character from the comic book.

Aquaman is the ruler of Atlantis, and while he comes from a human background, is able to telepathically control the fish in the ocean, as well as the sea itself.

Part man, part machine, Victor is a Cyborg - a high school student merged with a Mother Box when he was injured.

As a founding member of the Justice League the character is far stronger than the average person, can interface with computers, and emit various types of energy that make him a formidable fighter.

https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14151523/thomas-becket-killed/,2021-03-31 09:14:43+00:00,Why was Thomas Becket killed?,"THE assassination of Thomas Becket is known as one of the famous, shocking, and violent murders in history.

But just what happened between Becket and King Henry II to lead to the then Archbishop of Canterbury's demise?

5 Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, was murdered in the Kent cathedral Credit: Hulton Archive - Getty

Who was Thomas Becket?

Thomas Becket, later known as Thomas a Becket, was born in 1120.

His father was a well-connected London merchant and Thomas was well educated.

Becket was noticed by King Henry II whilst working as a clerk for the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theobald.

He was a fun-loving courtier and Henry made him Lord Chancellor.

The pair got on famously well and became very close.

Becket and King Henry brought law and order to England, and Henry hoped to extend this to the Church.

But Becket restyled himself as a serious cleric when Henry made him Archbishop of Canterbury after Theobald died in 1161.

Just three years later, the former friends had a massive argument because Becket wanted to keep the Church legally separate - and this led to the Archbishop going into hiding.

He returned in 1170, and four of Henry’s knights killed him in Canterbury Cathedral, on December 29.

Becket was made a Saint after his murder, and pilgrims flocked to his shrine, even after it was destroyed by Henry VIII centuries later, in 1540.

Why did Henry II and Thomas Becket fall out?

Henry II and Becket were at first firm friends - they played chess together, and hunted, and it has been said they were of one heart and mind.

As King and Chancellor, they worked hard together to bring in laws and establish order in Henry’s kingdom.

We owe the existence of common law and trial by jury today to their team work and persistence.

But the Church still often escaped justice, swearing allegiance to the Pope rather than the King.

Henry wanted to reform law to include the Church, whose clergy could literally get away with murder, and rape.

Priests who broke the common law could be tried in the Churches own court, getting just a penance, defrocking at worst, as punishment.

King Henry thought that Archbishop and Chancellor Thomas Becket would help him extend the laws they had created over the Church.

But Becket refused, and resigned as Chancellor.

Many historians say Thomas Becket’s transformation from fun-loving to serious and devout was pretty extreme, and came as a shock to Henry.

Becket replaced his lavish lifestyle with sparse eating, wearing sack-cloth, and drinking only water.

The situation came to an ugly head in October 1164, when Henry summoned Becket, and the King’s supporters accused him of treason and asked him to hand over all his property.

Becket refused and apparently there was a heated argument with much swearing and shouting, then Becket fled to France.

Why was Thomas Becket killed?

Even with Becket in France, the two men still managed to argue.

Henry had the Archbishop of York crown his son, and Becket complained to the Pope.

The pair later patched it up, Becket agreed to come back, and the King promised him safety.

But Becket excommunicated a number of bishops, and damned them in his sermon on Christmas Day, after his return to England in 1170.

When Henry heard about this he was furious, and apparently said: ""Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?""

5 Canterbury Cathedral has become a place of pilgrimage for many Christians Credit: PA:Press Association/PA Images

Other sources claim he said: ""What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their Lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-bornclerk?""

Four of his knights, looking to please the king, then set off for Canterbury to do the deed.

The attack on Thomas, said to be unintentional, at the high altar of Canterbury Cathedral, was so vicious that accounts say they butchered him, cracking open his skull and spilling his brains on the floor.

King Henry starved himself for three days, wearing sack-cloth, because he felt so guilty about his words.

Martered, Thomas Becket was made a Saint very speedily, in 1173, and believers visited his shrines seeking healing miracles.

Dominykas Zeglaitis — aka Durte Dom — is Dobrik's childhood pal and an ex-member of the Vlog Squad, a group of prankster YouTubers who live in a Los Angeles mansion.

Zeglaitis has been accused of raping an extra from one of their videos in 2018, according to Business Insider.

The allegations, which surfaced last week, have led to Dobrik losing more than 100,000 subscribers.

While last night Spark Capital, a major Dispo investor, said it had decided to “sever all ties with the company”.

In a statement, Spark Capital said: ""In light of recent news about the Vlog Squad and David Dobrik, the cofounder of Dispo, we have made the decision to sever all ties with the company.

""We have stepped down from our position on the board and we are in the process of making arrangements to ensure we do not profit from our recent investment in Dispo.""

Hours later, Dobrik stepped down from the board.

Dispo, in a statement to TechCrunch, said: ""David has chosen to step down from the board and leave the company to not distract from the company’s growth.

""Dispo’s team, product, and most importantly our community, stand for building a diverse, inclusive, and empowering world.""

Zeglaitis' accuser says herself and some student friends went to the Vlog Squad mansion to film a video.

The alleged victim was unaware of Zeglaitis, but her pals are believed to have known that he played a sex addict character in Vlog Squad videos.

At the mansion, they were allegedly given alcohol, with friends saying that the woman, in particular, was given enough to get drunk.

The woman says she was later raped by Zeglaitis when she was unable to consent to sex.

Dobrik allegedly filmed her as she entered Zeglaitis' bedroom, posting the video days later as a ""threesome"" plot with the title ""SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE PLAYED WITH FIRE!!"".

The video was taken down at woman's request - but had already been watched five million times.

Grant Townsend, 26, was found dead by his mum at their home in Hull, Humberside on June 6 last year.

He had battled mental health for a number of years.

Hull Coroner's Court heard he had intended to take his own life after struggling following a false allegation of rape against him.

Mr Townsend was acquitted at a trial.

His mum Keely Gillbey told the inquest her son feared ""the title of rapist would never go away"" even though he'd been found innocent.

'DETERIORATE'

His mental health got worse from 2017 after the false allegation, Ms Gillbey said.

She said: ""He was found not guilty - it took them less than 10 minutes for all of them to come back with a not guilty verdict.

""But it affected Grant in a big, big way, especially knowing what I had gone through as a child.

""To be accused of that affected him big time, it really did. I watched him deteriorate.""

He was found not guilty, but it affected Grant in a big, big way, Keely Gillbey

The inquest also heard he had ""found it difficult to leave the house"" and insisted he was fine, even though Ms Gillbey found a suicide note declaring his innocence.

They didn't discuss the note, but she believes he knew she found it as she threw away tablets that were in his room.

Mr Townsend had started a relationship with a woman a short time later, the court heard.

""They got a house together but they did have problems"", Ms Gillbey told the inquest.

'SOBBED'

Mr Townsend was kicked out of their home after problems with the couple getting jobs.

Ms Gillbey said: ""The day he came home he sobbed and he could barely go outside and was fed up with everything.""

The inquest heard he was ""crying himself to sleep"".

He had also struggled to come to terms with abuse his mum suffered and his uncle's death and was teased about his accent after moving from Kent to Hull when he was a schoolboy.

YOU'RE NOT ALONE EVERY 90 minutes in the UK a life is lost to suicide. It doesn't discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society - from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers. It's the biggest killer of people under the age of 35, more deadly than cancer and car crashes. And men are three times more likely to take their own life than women. Yet it's rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now. That is why The Sun launched the You're Not Alone campaign. The aim is that by sharing practical advice, raising awareness and breaking down the barriers people face when talking about their mental health, we can all do our bit to help save lives. Let's all vow to ask for help when we need it, and listen out for others... You're Not Alone.

On June 6, Ms Gillbey came downstairs around 5.30am to find her son sleeping on the sofa.

Ms Gillbey revealed the phone conversation they had after she arrived at work, where Mr Townsend asked if his dog had ""settled"" the night before.

Speaking after the inquest, Ms Gillbey said: ""His dog Kilo was his life.He absolutely worshipped him.

""I think that's why when I spoke to him in the morning, I should have clicked then that something wasn't right because he kept asking me 'did the dog settle with you last night' and whether or not 'the dog was definitely alright with you mum, definitely, definitely alright'.""

'LOVEABLE ROGUE'

Ms Gillbey found her son's body after returning home from work.

Neighbours battled to save him life by performing CPR, but paramedics confirmed he had died.

Paying tribute to her son, Ms Gillbey said: ""He was a bit of a loveable rogue. To look at him, to meet him, you wouldn't know that anything was wrong.

""Knowing that inside his head was turmoil, his face never showed it.

""I think that goes for a lot of men that are suffering out there, they all walk around out there with a smile on their face.""

Coroner Michael Mellun ruled Mr Townsend's death was suicide.

He said: ""Not only did he die through his own actions but he did intend to die, taking into account that he had been suffering from anxiety and depression and the allegation of rape still weighed heavily above him.""

Police said the teenage girl was walking on open land to the south of Westleigh Park between 4pm and 5.30pm when she was approached by a man.

He then pulled her into some bushes before raping her, officers said.

Superintendent Mark Kenny of GMP's Wigan District said: ""This has been a fast-paced investigation and as a result of our enquiries we have now made an arrest.

""While people in the area will continue to see an increased police presence this evening and over the coming days, I would like to stress that we don't consider there to be any wider threat to the public following this attack.

""At this stage of our investigations, we are not seeking anyone further in connection with this incident.

""However, I'd like to encourage anyone with information to still get in touch, if you have not done so already.

""I would also like to thank those members of the public who have already come forward with information.”

Police previously had described her attacker as a white man, around 6ft tall with green eyes and aged about 20 or slightly younger.

They said he was wearing a black hooded top, black Covid mask and black jogging bottoms with two white stripes running down the outside of the leg.

He was also wearing green trainers with a grey trim near the sole and black laces, and brown/green camouflage gloves with bobble grips on the palms.

The man was described as having a southern-sounding accent. He also had a black tattoo on the right side of his neck.

Earlier today Superintendent Kenny said: ""The girl is receiving care from specialist officers while we investigate this terrifying attack. Our thoughts are with her and her family.

""She has shown immense bravery in recounting a very detailed description of the offender.""

Sage Curry, 19, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and burglary, according to Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office near Tampa Bay, Florida.

2 Sage Curry is alleged to have killed the woman as they slept

Investigators say Curry confessed to what they believe are the random killings of his victims, with whom he has no previous relationship, reports WFLA-TV.

He stabbed the first woman multiple times in the chest while she slept, according to the Sheriff’s Office arrest report.

Sage then allegedly turned the knife on the second woman when she came to defend the sleeping victim.

At this stage it is unclear whether the mom or daughter was first to be attacked with the knife that came from their own kitchen.

2 Cops say he followed the strangers home

Jordan Martin, a local resident who said he worked with Curry at a nearby car wash, described the suspect as a quiet, nice young man who kept to himself.

“Just shock overall, I’d never think someone like this could do something like that. So just shocked right now,” Martin told WFLA-TV, when asked how he felt.

Cops were called to a home on 8th Avenue NW in Largo just before 2am on Monday after Curry ran to a neighbor and asked for help.

When investigators went inside the home, they found two bodies on the floor.

Curry allegedly told police that he followed the women to their home.

Their brazenness is shocking - yet it's only the latest in a string of horrific crimes, including assassinations and stabbings, linked to foreign gangsters who have infiltrated the UK capital.

London has become a hotbed of international criminals - from Albanian cocaine kingpins and African street gangsters to Turkish Cypriots known for robberies and contract killings.

On one residential street in Walthamstow - home to the notorious Somali 'Mali Boys' gang - families have been left so terrified by bloody gang warfare they refuse to go out at night.

36

Stabbed, beaten and impaled on railings

Elsewhere in the capital, people have been beaten to death, knifed in the street, found impaled on railings and had their homes raided, in incidents all linked to international gangs.

While many of the victims are foreign gangsters themselves, others are unsuspecting members of the public and even celebrities - like Marcus, who was left devastated by the raid on his home.

And experts tell Sun Online the situation in London is only escalating - as the UK's £11 billion drugs trade and other illicit markets have become more powerful and international in recent years.

""We’ve observed a rise of internationally-affiliated gangs controlling illegal trade and organised criminal activity in areas of London and across county borders surrounding London and further afield,"" says top London-based defence solicitor Nick Titchener.

36 The London-based Albanian gang 'Hellbanianz' have boasted about their lawless lifestyle in Instagram snaps Credit: Refer to Caption

""These criminal networks can span continents and will engage in activities such as drug, firearm and people trafficking, fraud offences and prostitution, with the proceeds of criminal activity then being laundered in a variety of ways to disguise the profit that is being generated.""



Gangs fighting for turf

He adds: ""London has become a hotbed for the gang-controlled drug markets.

""Unfortunately, with the drugs and sex trade there is often an associated increase in violent crimes, serious assault charges, and murder offences as control of an area is fought for.""

In London, up to a third of all suspects are reported to be from abroad.

But former undercover cop Neil Woods tells us that every time tireless London officers bring down organised criminals, they open up opportunities for more efficient gangsters to swoop in.

""What police do is they get rid of the competition,"" he says.

""It's like any marketplace - the more efficient ones grow and become bigger monopolies. The people in control of drug supplies now are in charge of big international businesses...

""You'll have much more of this as time goes on, it's inevitable.""

The National Crime Agency (NCA) reckons there are at least 4,600 organised crime groups (OCGs) operating across the UK today, with London now dubbed the world's money-laundering capital.

Of course, many of these are brutal home-grown British gangs.

But recently, the rise of people and drug-smuggling, the Internet, and Brits' seemingly insatiable appetite for cocaine has seen an influx of foreign gangsters descend on the country.

Others - often those at the top - are running operations in London from luxury pads overseas.

Here, we reveal some of the ruthless international criminals infiltrating the capital...

The Albanian cocaine kingpins

Turf: East London

Albanian mobsters have become the ""dominant"" global players in Britain's drugs trade, Neil says, having pulled off a near-total takeover of our £5 billion cocaine industry.

The NCA warns these ruthless gangsters - who use London as their main hub - pose a ""significant threat"" and are quick to use ""violence, particularly around enforcing the drug trade"".

Sources say the Albanians have teamed up with the ’Ndrangheta, the most powerful Italian Mafia franchise, to ship huge hauls of cocaine to the UK from European sea ports.

Once inside the country, the drug is pushed by street dealers and enforcers such as the brazen Hellbanianz, who have been blamed for rising gang violence in East London.

Based in Barking, the street gang has previously posted rap videos and pictures of flash cars, guns and wads of cash on social media, encouraging other Albanian foot-soldiers to join them.

Solicitor Nick, of Lawtons Law, tells us: ""There’s no doubt that social media can promote the recruitment of young people, attracted by images of piles of cash, expensive watches, and a lifestyle that might seem to be out of reach.

""These are the people that often lose out as they are on the front line, putting themselves at risk from gang violence, becoming addicted themselves or ending up in court facing prosecution and a criminal conviction.""

In one set of shocking rap lyrics, Hellbanianz gangsters boasted: “We gun you down cos Albanians need no reason. They try to catch us, but these Albanians can’t be caught.""

Despite their claims, three of the gang were locked up for a total of 42 years in 2016 after police discovered £6 million of drugs and a Skorpion sub-machine gun with a silencer.

Dozens of other Albanian criminals have also been arrested and jailed across Britain in recent years - with figures showing they now make up one in ten foreign prisoners.

Known as the Mafia Shqiptare, gangsters from Albania are governed by the deadly 'kanun' code: the right to take revenge, according to the Mail on Sunday.

They reportedly carry out assassinations in the UK for £15,000 to £100,000 a hit. They have also been accused of running brothels and torturing underworld enemies.

Yet it's not just London the Albanians have infiltrated.

They have also turned Essex into a European crime hotspot, while The Sun revealed last year how an Albanian gang operated a “Deliveroo for drugs” in leafy Tunbridge Wells, Kent.

Some Albanian gangsters reach Britain using false papers or hidden in the backs of lorries. Others are thought to be the kids of migrants who came to the UK as asylum seekers in the late 1990s.

The ruthless Somali street gangsters

Turf: North-East London

Somalian gangsters have also become notorious in London due to their brutality.

In the north-east district of Walthamstow, the highly sophisticated Mali Boys, drawn mainly from the Somali community, run a terrifying campaign of drug dealing, violence and intimidation.

They are said to be the “most business-driven, violent and ruthless” type of gang, shunning social media in favour of keeping their activities a secret and remaining anonymous to police.

They use old fashioned Nokia phones because they are less easy to track.

The Mali Boys' bosses originally came to Britain as children from war-torn Somalia, with police saying in 2018 they were earning up to £50,000 a week from drug sales.

One rival gang member told The Sun the group was ""a whole new entity""

“Those people come from countries where there are pirates, where people are gang-raped and beaten up, and it’s all in front of them,"" said the source.

""Some are ex-soldiers who have seen people’s heads blown off.

""So they feel they can come and do it here.""

Among the Mali Boys' turf is Walthamstow's Vallentin Road - dubbed 'Britain's most dangerous street' thanks to a string of violent attacks including fatal shootings and arson.

The road is also in the catchment area of five other criminal gangs, and one local told us: ""As a family we now want to make sure we’re home with the door locked for 7pm.""

In 2016, Jamal Goole, 19, a member of the Mali Boys, stabbed rival gang member Saren Golden, 25, outside a chicken shop on Lea Bridge Road in Leyton with a broken wine bottle.

In a separate incident a decade earlier, a feud between rival Somali gangs from Camden, Tottenham and Edmonton led to teen Mahir Osman being beaten to death in a mob attack.

The Chilean 'burglary tourists'

Turf: All over London

Chilean gangsters have terrorised London in recent years - yet instead of murders, beatings or drug offences, they have become known for raiding homes.

More than 75 Chilean burglars have been arrested in the UK in two years alone for ransacking properties for luxury goods in cases of so-called ""burglary tourism"".

They are reported to have swiped jewellery, watches and designer clothes in a series of multi-million-pound raids in London and elsewhere in England and Wales.

Earlier this month, four Chilean gangsters were jailed for the £33,000 raid on the Wareings' home, during which they snatched a gold Rolex and two luxury Omega watches.

A court heard they'd flown in from South America just days earlier, and that three orange dots were sprayed on the back fence to tell the burglars it was a high-value property.

Sentencing the burglars to three years and four months in prison each, the judge said: “No one here or abroad should be under an illusion that somehow the UK is a soft touch.

""Each of you came to this country with one purpose - crime.

""No other reason for your visit to the UK has been offered to me.""

In another recent case, a young man flying back to Chilean capital Santiago from Spain admitted a series of burglaries in and around London, the Daily Mail reports.

He was found to have more than £50,000 worth of diamonds on him.

Police believe the ""burglary tourists"" - many of whom have previous convictions for burglary or robbery - could be carrying out the legwork for London-based crime lords.

And it's easy for them to fly in - they don't need visas to visit Britain as ""tourists"" for up to three months.

The Bengali machete thugs

Turf: East End

Bengali gangs have also made their mark on the capital, after taking over its vibrant East End - where the borough of Tower Hamlets has been dubbed ""a hotbed of teen gang violence"".

The area has one of London's highest ethnic minority populations, made up mainly of people of Bangladeshi origin, who are among the UK's youngest and fastest-growing communities.

While most aren't involved in gangs, the street mobsters here are reported to be extremely territorial, dishing out ""swift and brutal"" violence to anyone who dares to step in their path.

They have fought rivals in the past with machetes, meat cleavers and baseball bats.

An investigation in the Telegraph Magazine also found Bengali drug runners had flooded the East End's streets with cocaine and heroin - described as ""the currency out of the ghetto"".

In 2012, Bengali Londoner Udjal Kamrujzaman revealed the shocking violence of the local street gangs, recalling a night in the late 1990s where five different mobs clashed.

“All of the tendons in my hand were cut with a meat cleaver,"" he said, according to the New Statesman. ""My friend’s ear and fingers were hanging off. I wasn’t sure if I was going to live.""

Most Bengali gangsters are reported to be aged between 14 and 25, and solicitor Nick says: ""One of the most unfortunate elements to this type of gang activity in London is the number of young people, male and female who are dragged in as workers or 'runners' for the gangs at a young age.""



The Turkish-Cypriot mobsters

Turf: South London

In South London, a Turkish-Cypriot crime mob has carried out a reign of terror since the late 1960s, involving armed robbery, contract killing and drug trafficking.

Named the Arifs, the gangsters rose to notoriety as they filled a vacuum left by the downfall of the Kray twins, as well as the infamous Clerkenwell and Brindle families.

By the 80s, they had become one of the most feared gangs in the capital.

And even decades later, in 2004, they were branded “Britain’s No1 crime family”.

Despite a series of arrests and successful convictions, the family are thought to have maintained ties with Turkey, with accomplices allegedly overseeing drugs shipments to mainland Europe.

The extent of their operations today is unclear.

But in 2016, London-based gang member Bekir Arif, nicknamed 'The Duke', was jailed for 11-and-a-half years for his role in a £1.5 million drugs ring.

36 An older picture of Arif, who has convictions dating back to 1977

Arif, in his mid-60s, has convictions dating back to 1977 when he was imprisoned for his role in an armed robbery that resulted in the death of a security guard.

In 1999, he was jailed for 23 years for conspiracy to supply 100kg of heroin worth £12.5million.

He was the third of seven brothers to receive major prison terms.

Russian hit squads

Turf: Various parts of London

Russian criminals have been linked to a string of deaths and money-laundering crimes in London.

Just this month, it was claimed that a millionaire found impaled on railings below a £2 million flat in Marylebone, north-west London, in December 2014 was a fixer for a Russian mob.

Cops found that Scot Young, 52, had jumped to his death from the fourth-floor balcony, but an inquest returned an open verdict - with his family maintaining he was murdered.

Scot had close links to the now-deceased Boris Berezovsky, the exiled Russian oligarch who opposed President Vladimir Putin, and it is said he ""fell in with a major organised crime group"".

But his isn't the only suspicious death on UK soil - a BuzzFeed News probe has linked 14 suspected assassinations to Russia, although they aren't necessarily connected to gangs.

Outside of London, there was also the Novichok poisoning of ex-Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his then-33-year-old daughter Yulia in Wiltshire in March 2018.

Aside from 'hits', Russian criminals have also hidden ""dirty"" money in British assets and laundered it through City of London financial institutions, according to UK lawmakers.

London has been described as the Western capital of choice for Russian officials and oligarchs who flaunt their wealth across Europe’s most luxurious destinations.

From the Nigerian mobile cons to the Italian Mafia...

Other foreign gangs who have been linked to London include Nigerian mobile cons, Jamaican Yardies and the 'under-the-radar' Italian Mafia, to name a few.

A Sun investigation revealed in 2018 how Nigerian crime lords are making millions from phones swiped by acid-armed moped thugs on UK streets.

We found the nicked mobiles were being sold to Nigeria’s tech-starved middle classes for up to £560 each after being shipped 4,500 miles from Britain.

Nigerian criminals were also linked to London last year, when three siblings were convicted of laundering nearly £1 million through UK bank accounts for the Black Axe organised crime ring.

The trio, who lived in Greenwich, were working directly for the leader of the gang - which is banned in Nigeria and has been linked to murders, rapes, extortion and drug dealing, the CPS said.

Also in London, the Jamaican Yardies are reported to be continuing a violent legacy, with an IBTimes report claiming their influence ""remains in the brutality of street gangs across London"".

And members of the Italian Mafia have infiltrated the capital, too.

""The Mafia invest in real estate and illicit businesses,"" says University of Essex criminologist Dr Anna Sergi, who specialises in the Mafia, organised crime and drug trafficking.

""They hide in London as well. There are some Mafia people living in the UK unknown.""

In 2013, infamous Mafia boss Domenico Rancadore, dubbed 'The Professor' was rumbled after 19 years on the run when he was found living in Uxbridge, west London, under the alias ‘Marco Skinner’.

He faced extradition to Italy but his case 'expired'. He is believed to remain in the UK.

One foreign suspect arrested every 3 minutes

In recent years, shocking figures have shown that nearly a fifth of all crime suspects arrested by UK police are foreigners, with more than 172,000 detained in one year alone.

This equals an average of one arrest every three minutes, The Mail on Sunday reported.

The Home Office has warned that ""any foreign national offender who poses a threat to the UK should be in no doubt of our determination to deport them"".

In the 12 months leading up to July 2019, more than 5,000 foreign cons were kicked out - but The Sun on Sunday revealed in September that thousands more remain in our jails.

Many others are roaming the streets or running illicit trade in London from overseas.

And, as Neil warns, the gangsters' crimes are becoming more brutal every year.

The driver, Noah Green, 25, was shot dead by cops and investigators believe he had been delusional and having suicidal thoughts.

Evans, who had two young children, was an 18-year veteran of the force.

The president said: ""He was the one who always kept his word. He was the one who, just like the folks I grew up with, wasn't capable of saying no when you needed him.""

""Your dad is a hero,"" Biden told the children. .""It's in your blood,"" before adding ""the moment of the smile comes without the tear.""

Ahead of today's service, a statement from US Capitol Police said: ""As we mourn the loss of Officer Billy Evans, we are grateful for the honor bestowed upon him by Congress.""

US Capitol cops gathered outside the building and lined the streets as the hearse carrying the body of Evans entered the Capitol grounds around 10.30am.

Family and friends stood at the top of the steps of the Capitol building as his coffin, draped in the American flag, was removed from the hearse.

During the ceremony, the Chaplain of the United States Senate said they are experiencing ""anger, confusion and fear"" over the loss of ""a son, a father, a friend, and a partner.""

Paying tribute to Evans' children, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: ""Logan and Abigail, no words are adequate. We can only imagine your sadness.

""So many know about your dad and know he is a hero - his name will always be on our lips and in our hearts.""

Rep. Tim Ryan, who heads a committee which oversees the Capitol Police, said: ""The loss of Officer Evans is yet another stark reminder of what our brothers and sisters in uniform risk every day to protect us.

""The honor of lying in state under the Capitol dome is befitting of this American hero.""

Paying tribute to Evans, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted: ""With heavy hearts and in recognition of his courage and sacrifice, a grateful nation bids farewell to Officer Billy Evans, a true hero.

""His loss is enormous - our prayers are with his two children, his families, and his colleagues in Capitol Police.""

Last night, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""On April 2, a senseless attack on the Capitol claimed the life of Officer William 'Billy' Evans.

""Officer Evans will lie in honor under the Capitol rotunda, at the very center of the democracy he gave his life to protect.""

On Tuesday he added: ""Officers are approached by hundreds of lost tourists a day, lucky ones bump into Billy"" before dubbing him a ""fellow of infinite jest.""

""Billy was a man of many crews - one you'd want to be stationed with,"" Schumer added, before saying Evans received ""joy and laughter out of life's smallest moments.""

""Those of you who remember Billy need to speak his name,"" he finalized.

Senator Elizabeth Warren said Evans ""made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our Capitol"".

""We are forever in his debt,"" she said.

In a statement earlier this month, his family said his two children - Logan and Abigail - were the most important thing in his life.

He was remembered by colleagues and friends as a man with a sense of humor who loved baseball and golf.

""His most cherished moments were those spent with them building with Lego, having lightsaber duels, playing board games, doing arts and crafts, and recently finishing the Harry Potter series,"" the family said.

""He was always so eager to show how proud he was of everything they did.""

The family said Evans was proud of his job - and his friendship with colleagues near the ""North Barricade"" of the Capitol complex was one of the best parts of it.

""We hold them in our hearts, as we know they acutely share our grief,"" they said.

On the Senate floor on Monday evening, Senator Dick Durbin, said Evans was a ""familiar and friendly face"" at the barricade where he was killed.

""Every day it is incumbent on those of us who work in this building to remember this officer, and to thank him, and the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police who have given so much to keep us safe,"" Durbin said.

Evans death came just three months after a violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, injuring dozens of Capitol Police officers.

Mom Amy then exclusively opened up to The Sun telling how she was ""devastated"" by Josh's child porn charges, which he has denied.

Josh, who is married to Anna Duggar, was charged with one count of possession of a child pornographic photo and a second count of receiving a child pornographic photo on Friday.

The charges came after he was arrested on Thursday in Arkansas.

At his arraignment in court on Friday, Josh pleaded not guilty to the charges, and was ordered to remain in custody until at least May 5.

Amy, 34, today posted a new message that added more fuel to the fire among her Twitter followers, depicting a sad Emoji face and a gif of a raindrop or tear falling into a pond.

The droplet was seen causing a huge amount of ripples - perhaps referencing the wide-ranging after-effects of Josh's arrest.

Josh's brother-in-law Derick Dillard has already appeared to agree with fans claiming TLC show Counting On, which stars Josh's family but not Josh, should be scrapped.

On April 20, Derek Chauvin, 45, was convicted of all three murder and manslaughter charges against him.

Who is Kellie Chauvin?

Kellie Chauvin was Derek Chauvin's wife.

Derek was found guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd.

The judge announced the jury's verdict at just after 4pm local time on April 20. Following the news, Chauvin was seen being led from the court in handcuffs.

He is now on suicide watch in a maximum security jail and faces a sentence of up to 75 years in prison.

Kellie divorced Derek shortly after he was charged over Floyd's death. They do not have any children together.

Kellie, 46, was born in Laos in 1974. Her family fled to Thailand in 1977 following the war.

She's a former radiologist and beauty queen, who won the title of Mrs Minnesota in 2018.

According to Twin Cities, Kellie entered the pageant at the urging of a pal.

Kellie explained that she wanted to represent the Hmong community, as she had been bullied as a child for her heritage, appearance, and refugee status.

She has given financial help to several Hmong nonprofits and small businesses.

The mum-of-two has also volunteered as a translator at local hospitals, along with making her home a “safe haven” for Hmong women going through difficult times.

She said: “I help them find housing and jobs and provide resources they need to succeed.

“It really just takes one person to make a difference.”

Vantu News said that Kellie's most recent job was selling homes for estate agent Re/Max.

Her estranged husband, white police officer Derek Chauvin, was caught on camera, kneeling on George Floyd's neck for nine minutes, stopping him from breathing until he died.

Floyd could be heard pleading “I can’t breathe” while Chauvin ignored bystanders' pleas to get off his neck.

Chauvin was fired from the Minneapolis police department and his wife left him.

Three other officers involved in the arrest were also fired.

What has Kellie Chauvin said about George Floyd's death?

A distressed Kellie Chauvin released a statement via her Minneapolis lawyer, Sekula Law Offices, at the time of Floyd's death.

It says: ""Kellie is devastated by Mr Floyd’s death and her utmost sympathy lies with his family, with his loved ones, and with everyone who is grieving this tragedy.

""She has filed for dissolution of her marriage to Derek Chauvin.

""While Ms Chauvin has no children from her current marriage, she respectfully requests that her children, her elder parents, and her extended family be given safety and privacy during this difficult time.""

Her comments attracted sympathy on Facebook, with the likes of Addison Steiner posting: ""Kellie is a friend of mine. I knew her before she married Derek.

""She is a kind, gentle and compassionate woman. Prayers for her.""

Marilyn Sychra added: ""I pray for peace and solace for this lady. She had nothing to do with the actions against Mr. Floyd.""

Brandi Cross posted: ""My prayers go out to you Kellie as well.

""Your life changed in an instant and is over as you once knew it.""

Why are Derek and Kellie Chauvin divorcing?

Kellie Chauvin filed for divorce from Derek Chauvin on May 28, 2020, three days after the horrific death of George Floyd.

The former Mrs Minnesota said “irretrievable breakdown” of their relationship was to blame for ending their 10-year marriage.

According to court papers obtained by The Sun, Kellie said in a court filing that she doesn’t want any money or financial help from her cop ex, despite being an unemployed estate agent.

“[The] respondent is fully capable of supporting herself,” the filing states.

Both Kellie and her estranged hubby waived their rights to ""temporary or permanent spousal maintenance,"" from each other, according to the court papers.

When did they get married and do they have children?

Kellie married Derek Chauvin in 2010, after the pair met and fell in love while she was working as a radiologist at a hospital.

She told the St Paul Pioneer Press that they met when he dropped off a suspect at a Minneapolis hospital where she worked.

The couple don't have any children, but Kellie does have two kids from her previous relationship with ex-husband Kujay Xiong.

Minneapolis City Council records show that Derek Chauvin moonlighted as a bouncer at a downtown Latin nightclub before he joined the police.

Leicestershire Police confirmed a 28-year-old man from Leicester has been arrested on suspicion of murder and he remains in police custody.

The force said enquires into Geetika's death are ongoing as they probe the area for clues - checking CCTV and making house to house enquiries.

Detective Inspector Jenni Heggs, of the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, said: “A dedicated team has been carrying out enquiries since yesterday morning to establish the full circumstances of Geetika’s death and how this has happened and we continue to appeal to anyone with any information to make contact with us.

“Officers remain with Geetika’s family providing full support. A man arrested on suspicion of murder currently remains in police custody.""

In a statement last night, police said: ""Officers were called by a member of the public to the area at 2.25am after a 29-year-old woman was found injured lying on the pavement in the street.

""Police and East Midlands Ambulance Service attended. Sadly the woman was pronounced dead at the scene.""

Meanwhile, residents told of their shock after hearing the news.

A pensioner, who did not wish be named, who lives opposite the spot where the tragic 29-year-old was discovered, told the Sun: “It’s a terrible thing to happen and out hearts go out to the poor girl’s family.

""I’ve lived here for many years, it’s a nice safe area and nothing bad ever happens here. There’s never any trouble and we’re all in a state of disbelief.”

She added: “The first we knew about the murder was when police came knocking on our door. They’ve been here all day making inquiries and carrying out forensics examination. It's right across from my front door.

""We don’t know who she is and don’t believe she lives in the street but it’s an unusual place to be and it’s not a short cut to anywhere. There is a foot path leading from the main road.”

Another householder said: ""Police have been making door to door enquiries and told everyone to stay in their homes. One man was taking his wheelie bin outside but was asked to go back inside.

“It’s shocking and we’re just relieved that a suspect has been arrested.”

Cops are now urging anyone with information to come forward.

One of the gang's former victims spoke of her betrayal to find one of the men, a father-of-five and taxi driver, is back living near her in Greater Manchester - the same area where the horrific crimes where perpetrated.

Pictures emerged on social media showing Abdul Rauf, 51, in the Lancashire town, two years after losing the right to stay in Britain.

Concerned Rochdale residents shared the images with friends and family.

Two other grooming gang members - Abdul Aziz, 49, and Adil Khan, 50 - reportedly live nearby.

SPOTTED IN TOWN

One of the gang's victims told the Mirror: “I thought Theresa May had organised his deportation, so how come he’s still here?

""I feel violated to know he’s living near me – in the same area where he hunted for girls like me.

“It’s a total betrayal of grooming victims that he’s allowed to stay.”

I feel violated to know he's living near me – in the same area where he hunted for girls like me. Victim

The Rochdale child sex abuse ring was run by a group of men from Rochdale and Oldham, who exploited girls as young as 12.

Nine men were eventually jailed for a string of offences in 2012.

The vile group were initially given sentences ranging from four to 19 years after being found guilty of offences including rape and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a child.

The court heard how the men - eight of Pakistani origin and one from Afghanistan - gave their victims drink and drugs before “passing them” round for sex.

The abuse took place at two takeaway restaurants- now under new management - in the Heywood area of Rochdale by the men aged between 24 and 59.

Four members of the grooming gang – including ringleader Shabir Ahmed – faced deportation to Pakistan having dual British and Pakistani citizenship.

In 2016, then-home secretary Theresa May ruled it would be ""conducive to the public good"" to deprive the four of the right to remain in the UK.

They then fought, and lost, a long legal battle against deprivation of UK citizenship, losing a final Court of Appeal ruling in 2018.

Sentencing judge Gerald Clifton said the victims were ""raped callously, viciously and violently"".

STILL IN BRITAIN

In June 2019, four of the group were revealed to be still living in Britain, with no signs of any being prepared for deportation to Pakistan.

One of the men, Abdul Rauf, 51, is a father of five, a taxi driver and a former teacher at a mosque.

His sentence was six years for trafficking and sex with a girl, who was aged 15.

Abdul Aziz, 49, is a father of three and carried the more sinister title of 'The Master'.

He was originally sentenced to nine years for trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex with a child.

Adil Khan, 50, was given eight years for conspiracy and trafficking a 13-year-old girl who later became pregnant.

All three men have served their sentences.

The exposure of the grooming, sexual assault and trafficking of young girls in Rochdale was made public in 2012.

Police identified and interviewed 47 young girls who were potential victims of the gang.

After the gang was eventually jailed police, the Rochdale Safeguarding Children Board highlighted failures by 17 agencies who were meant to protect the children.

Crown prosecutors and the Rochdale Council were forced to apologise for their failings.

It led police forces across the country to change the way that they deal with missing people.

SICK GROOMING GANG Ahmed, known as ""Daddy"", was the ringleader of the gang. He is still serving a 22-year jail term for rape. Former taxi driver Aziz, a father-of-three, regularly took his young victim to different flats around Rochdale, where she was plied with cannabis and vodka and coerced into sex with men who paid him cash. Referred to as ""The Master"" by the gang, he played a ""leading role"" in the grooming. Jailed for nine years in May 2012, he was released in December 2015 after serving three years and seven months. Rauf, a father-of-five, trafficked a 15-year-old girl for sex, driving her to secluded areas to have sex with her in his taxi and ferry her to a flat in Rochdale where he and others had sex with her. He was jailed for six years and released in November 2014 after serving two years and six months of his sentence. A neighbour said he has a night-time driving job. Khan got a girl, 13, pregnant but denied he was the father then met another girl, 15, and trafficked her to others using violence when she complained. He was sentenced to eight years, released in 2016 and was last known to be living in Manchester. For two years from early 2008, girls as young as 12 were plied with alcohol and drugs and gang-raped in rooms above takeaway shops and ferried to different flats in taxis where cash was paid to use the girls. Police said as many as 47 girls were groomed.

What happened to Christopher on NCIS New Orleans?

In season six of NCIS New Orleans, agent Christopher LaSelle was shockingly killed in a mission gone wrong.

In episode Matthew 5:9, LaSelle died trying to avenge his brother's murder. He followed a trail of drug dealers, whom he linked to Cade's death down to Alabama.

Upon arriving to a cabin that he thought held clues about his brother's death, he was ambushed and murdered.

LaSelle followed an assailant who pulled a gun on an innocent woman, only to be fatally shot in his arm and stomach.

In his final few moments, viewers see a dream sequence where LaSelle is reunited with his brother.

What did Lucas Black say about Christopher LaSelle's death?

Actor Lucas Black had been playing agent LaSelle for seven years since he joined the cast in 2014.

After his character was killed off in the series, he took to Instagram to explain more of his decision to leave and his next ventures.

“Well, that's all she wrote for Agent LaSalle, but I wanted to take this time personally to thank all of you fans out there for your love and support,"" he began.

“You were there to celebrate the victories and to pick me up when I needed it and I appreciate that.""

""I want to say what an honour it was to play this character. I learned a lot about what the first responders do. Much respect to you guys.

“Also I support the military and appreciate what you guys do for us. Living in this wonderful country.

“A chapter has ended. What a great journey it was. Thank you guys so much. May God bless you,"" he concluded.

In another YouTube video, Black revealed he would be spending more time with his family now that his stint as agent LaSelle had come to an end.

He said: ""The show has been so good to me over the years. Exceeded my expectations and goals.

“But this job isn't easy for me. There's a lot of priorities in my life that get sacrificed for me to be here.

“But it's time for me to focus on those priorities in my life.""

Black didn't reveal anything about his next acting roles. He is active on social media and regularly discusses his faith and love for the outdoors.

Detectives have launched an urgent investigation into the attack which allegedly occurred in a hotel room in Eilat, Israel.

Police said the victim is believed to have been intoxicated and was raped after going to use the bathroom at the Red Sea Hotel.

She is thought not to have been a guest at the hotel, but to have been socialising there with a group of friends,

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu branded the attack as a ""crime against humanity"" and it has sparked nationwide outrage.

Thousands of people have taken to the streets protesting as they called for justice for the teenager.

They carried banners saying ""we won't be silent anymore"" and ""we believe you"".

The girl reported the attack on Friday, and two 27-year-old men from Hadera have been arrested.

Police have said they expect to make further arrests after assigning a special squad to the case.

One of the men reportedly told investigators that more than 30 men had sex with the girl, but he denied rape.

Men allegedly lined up outside the hotel room and patiently waited for their turn to rape the victim.

One of the girl's friends is said to have tried but failed to intervene to stop the alleged rape, and other witnesses allegedly simply ignored the attack.

Haaretz reports that some of the alleged perpetrators filmed the attack using the mobile phones.

Writing on Twitter, Mr Netanyahu said: “This is shocking, there is no other word.

“This is not only a crime against the girl, this is a crime against humanity itself that is worthy of all condemnation and those responsible must be brought to justice.”

Video of the assault is reported to have featured in a later exchange of messages between the girl and one of the men who has been arrested.

The man denied sending the messages and said another person had sent them using his mobile phone.

She told police: ""The following day, one of the young men approached me and told me that he has videos.

""He asked if I wanted him to send them to me, but I wasn’t capable of handling it.""

The victim has said she is encouraged by the support from the public as protests sweep Israel, but is unable to ignore trolls online who have jumped on the case, reports Times of Israel.

She said: ""No one knows what I went through, so how can you pass judgement and ask me questions?""

One of the girl's friends said one the suspects claimed he was a ""medic and wanted to help"" after coming across the victim.

But when it became clear she had been drinking, the suspect ""took advantage of her and slept with her when she was out of control"", reports Channel 13.

One of the arrested men claimed the security cameras would show it was consensual sex.

He claimed the men did line up outside the room, while the girl would call for them to come in.

Nine out of 10 rape cases in Israel are closed by prosecutors without charge, according to an annual survey released at the end 2019.

And shocking figures showed in 2018 some 63 per cent of alleged gang rape victims were aged between 12 and 18 in the country.

Hotel owner Pnina Maman has claimed there is no evidence the assault took place in her establishment - saying CCTV doesn't show men in the hallways waiting to rape the victim.

Ms Maman said: ""We are a hotel, not an educational institution. I’m not guilty of what happened.

""There were never 30 people in the hallways. We checked all the cameras. There was no gathering. This could have happened, unfortunately, in any hotel.

""We have no way of knowing what happens inside the rooms.”

Police officials said they had ""indication that there were several people in the same room"" and that this is a ""complex investigation"".

He oversaw Britain's entry to the European Communities, the decimalisation of British coinage and the height of the Troubles in Northern Ireland — but what were the allegations of child abuse made against him?

Who was Edward Heath?

Edward Richard George Heath was born to a lower-middle class family in Broadstairs, Kent, on July 9, 1916.

He attended Chatham House Grammar School in Ramsgate before winning a county scholarship to study at Balliol College, Oxford.

Heath was a talented musician and became involved in Conservative politics at Oxford. He was elected president of the Oxford University Conservative Association.

When war broke out in 1939, Heath went to America to take part in a debating tour before being called up to serve.

He received an emergency commission on March 22, 1941, as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery.

His work during the war earned him an MBE and he was demobbed in August 1946.

Heath began working in the Civil Service before resigning in November 1947 to stand as a Conservative Parliamentary Candidate for Bexley.

He was elected in the February 1950 election by a margin of 133 votes.

Heath was made Opposition Whip a year later, and worked up the Whips office to become Government Chief Whip under Anthony Eden in 1955.

He later served as Minister of Labour, Lord Privy Seal, Trade Secretary, President of the Board of Trade and Shadow Chancellor.

He became leader of the Conservative Party in 1965, and remained so despite losing the 1966 General Election.

Ted Heath eventually became Prime Minister in 1970, serving for four years. He was ousted as Tory leader by Margaret Thatcher in 1975.

Ted Heath died aged 89 on 17 July 2005.

What were the paedophile allegations made against him?

A two-year £1.5million police investigation into Edward Heath was wrapped up in March 2017 after finding no evidence of child abuse.

Codenamed Operation Conifer, the investigation by Wiltshire Police was based largely on allegations that Sir Edward was involved in satanic orgies and a Westminster paedophile ring — dismissed as vicious fantasy by his supporters.

It began in August 2015 in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal when Supt Sean Memory stood outside Sir Ted's former house in Salisbury and appeal for victims to come forward.

Chief Constable Mike Veale reportedly said he was ""120 per cent"" convinced that sordid allegations against the former PM were true, an article in the Mail on Sunday said.

Carl Beech began an elaborate web of lies about being sexually abused as a child by some of Britain's most powerful people - which kickstarted Operation Midland - costing the police £2.5 million.

What did Carl Beech falsely accuse him of?

Wiltshire Police said Beech was one of 40 people who had made allegations against Sir Edward, who was living in Salisbury, Wiltshire, before his death in 2005.

Beech said that Heath was part of the gang of high-profile abusers including Jimmy Savile who abused him and other boys when they were younger.

Heath was implicated in the plot, claiming that he was part of the people who raped, kidnapped and murdered boys in the late 1970s and early 80s.

Beech also said he witnessed the alleged VIP sex ring kill three boys.

What did the child abuse inquiry report reveal?

Heath would be questioned over allegations that he raped and indecently assaulted boys as young as 10 were he alive today, the controversial police report said.

A Wiltshire Police investigation, called Operation Conifer, concluded that seven of the claims would have been sufficiently credible to justify questioning Sir Edward, who was prime minister under caution.

None of the allegations about which Wiltshire Police would have questioned Sir Edward relate to when he was prime minister, the force said.

The Crown Prosecution Service has a policy of not making a charging decision on a suspect who is dead because they cannot be prosecuted.

The allegations Sir Edward would have been questioned over include rape of a boy aged 11, indecent assault of a 10-year-old boy and the indecent assault of a 15-year-old boy during three ""paid sexual encounters"", and are said to have occurred between 1961 and 1992 in the Met Police, Kent, Sussex, the Channel Islands and Wiltshire force areas.

Carl Beech was found guilty of perverting the course of justice, one of fraud, and several child sexual offences.

The Mozambique Republic Police said the man raped the kids while their parents were outside working - and he enticed the youngsters with money.

He carried out the sick sex attacks in the 7 de Abril Quatres in Chimoio City, according to Nation.

Figures from the cops show that two cases of rape are recorded every week in Manica Province.

More than 37 percent of women in Mozambique suffer physical and sexual violence in their lifetime, according to the country's latest Demographic and Health Survey.

Sexual offenders can be jailed for up to 12 years, which activists have said is too lenient, according to reports.

And Mozambique has previously come under fire for asking victims of sexual assault to make an official complaint before an investigation could be launched.

BRUTAL ATTACK

It comes after a young mum said she was repeatedly raped and brutally beaten for 11 days by 23 soldiers in Ethiopia.

The woman, 27, said she was brutalised by soldiers who forced nails and rocks into her vagina in the horror ordeal.

The woman said the troops tied her up and marched her through fields to a bush camp where she was raped and beaten for more than week, according to Reuters.

The mum is among hundreds of victims reporting horrific sexual violence by Ethiopian and allied Eritrean soldiers after fighting broke out in November in Tigray, doctors said.

Dr Fasika Amdeselassie, a top public health official for the government-appointed interim administration in Tigray, said some women are held captive for days or weeks at a time.

The 16-year-old was allegedly raped by 30 men in an Eilat hotel in Israel.

The alleged attack occurred in a hotel room in the town of Eilat, Israel

10 Police said the victim was raped after going to use the bathroom at the Red Sea Hotel

Fury is mounting over the attack as thousands hit the streets

The girl reportedly told police investigators that the following day she was approached by one of the men who told her he had videos of the attack.

""He asked if I wanted him to send them to me, but I wasn’t capable of handling it,"" Channel 13 reports her as saying.

Court testimony indicated the men had lined up outside the girl’s hotel room, callously waiting their turn to rape her.

One of the men reportedly told investigators that more than 30 men had sex with the girl, but he denied rape.

One of the girl's friends is said to have tried but failed to intervene to stop the alleged rape, and other witnesses allegedly simply ignored the attack.

Haaretz reports that some of the alleged perpetrators filmed the attack using the mobile phones.

Video of the assault is reported to have featured in a later exchange of messages between the girl and one of the men who has been arrested.

The man denied sending the messages and said another person had sent them using his mobile phone.

Police said the victim was raped after going to use the bathroom at the Red Sea Hotel.

She is thought not to have been a guest at the hotel, but to have been socialising there with a group of friends.

OUTRAGE IGNITED

The case has sent shockwaves throughout Israel as thousands have taken to the streets calling for justice for the teenager.

They carried banners saying ""we won't be silent anymore"" and ""we believe you"".

The victim has said she is encouraged by the support from the public as protests sweep Israel, but is unable to ignore trolls online who have jumped on the case, reports Times of Israel.

“I feel that there are a lot of people behind me and this really strengthens me,” she said, according to Channel 13.

“No one knows what I went through, so how can you pass judgement and ask me questions?”

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu branded the attack as a ""crime against humanity"".

National outrage has swept Israel over the alleged attack

Nine out of 10 rape cases in Israel are closed by prosecutors without charge

Protesters show they are 'gagged' in a message to the authorities

Writing on Twitter, Mr Netanyahu said: “This is shocking, there is no other word.

“This is not only a crime against the girl, this is a crime against humanity itself that is worthy of all condemnation and those responsible must be brought to justice.”

The owner of the hotel, Pnina Maman, denies there was any evidence the suspected assault took place at her establishment.

“We are a hotel, not an educational institution. I’m not guilty of what happened,"" she told Channel 12 news.

""There were never 30 people in the hallways. We checked all the cameras.

""There was no gathering. This could have happened, unfortunately, in any hotel. We have no way of knowing what happens inside the rooms.”

Protesters wore face coverings as they called for justice

Signs of 'we believe you' are waved by demonstrators

Since the girl reported the attack on Friday, two 27-year-old men from Hadera have been arrested.

According to Channel 12 news, one of the suspects denied involvement.

Police have said they expect to make further arrests after assigning a special squad to the case.

Officers have taken footage from security cameras in the hotel and are trying to identify suspects in the footage.

One of the girl's friends said one the suspects claimed he was a ""medic and wanted to help"" after coming across the victim.

But when it became clear she had been drinking, the suspect ""took advantage of her and slept with her when she was out of control"", reports Channel 13.

One of the arrested men claimed the security cameras would show it was consensual sex.

He claimed the men did line up outside the room, while the girl would call for them to come in.

Nine out of 10 rape cases in Israel are closed by prosecutors without charge, according to an annual survey released at the end 2019.

And shocking figures showed in 2018 some 63 per cent of alleged gang rape victims were aged between 12 and 18 in the country.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the alleged attack was a 'crime against humanity'

Defense Minister Benny Gantz said: “From yesterday afternoon, I’ve been trying, and failing, to understand: What is a man who is standing on a crowded line with dozens of others, on the way to a room where a young, disoriented girl is lying down, trying to prove?”

During a Thursday afternoon press briefing, Atlanta police said that Long, 21, often went to the locations he targeted and bought a firearm the day of the murders.

Police Deputy Chief Charles Hampton Jr said law enforcement was ""looking at everything,"" says ""nothing is off the table.""

Cops previously said Long insisted the shooting wasn't racially motivated but noted that it was too early in the investigation to rule out a hate crime.

""I can say that he had frequented both of those locations, yes,"" Hampton told reporters. ""Unfortunately, they were at that location. I can't say that he specifically targeted those individuals.""

He added: ""But I will say that he did frequent those locations as the question keeps coming up he did frequent those two locations in Atlanta.

""We just want to make sure that we do our due dilligence,"" the cop added. ""Some of the family may reside stateside so maybe even here in the Atlanta area but we just want to do our due diligence [identifying the victims].

WHAT WE KNOW:

8 people died in three separate shootings at massage parlors.

The first began at around 5pm on March 16 at the Youngs Asian Massage Parlor.

Two people died at the scene, three casualties were transported to the hospital, where another two also died.

Nearly an hour later, the gunman began another shooting spree in the Buckhead neighbourhood of Atlanta at Gold Spa.

Three women were found dead at the second massage parlor.

A fourth woman was shot dead at Aromatherapy Spa, just across the street from Gold Spa.

Seven of the eight victims were women and six were Asian, police say.

Long, 21, was arrested after a lengthy police pursuit that saw his black 2007 Hyundai Tuscon rammed off the road.

Hampton said they weren't aware of any ""mental illness"" but that Long did ""purchase the gun the day of the incident.""

Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Capt. Jay Baker previously comment that Long had “a really bad day” and “this is what he did"" prompted a backlash.

At least eight people were killed in shootings in Atlanta on Tuesday, March 16, mainly Asian women, including six of the eight dead, cops said.

Of the eight dead, seven were women and one a man, added officials.

The first shooting took place at Young’s Asian Massage in Acworth, followed by shootings at the Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa in Atlanta.

In the first shooting, two Asian women, one white woman and a white man were killed while three Asian women were then gunned down at Gold Spa, before an Asian woman was shot dead at Aromatherapy Spa.

At around 5pm cops responded to reports of a shooting at Young’s Asian Massage, off Bells Ferry Road and Highway 92 in Acworth, where they found five people with gunshot wounds.

Three people were taken to a hospital, where two of them died.

Long previously told investigators he had a ""sex addiction"" and thought the spas he targeted were a temptation for him.

President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris planned to meet with Asian American community leaders in Georgia in the wake of the parlor shootings, the White House said this afternoon.

Biden directed that flags be flown at half-staff through sunset Monday today in honor of the victims.

Former roommate Tyler Bayless, 35, told Reuters that he spent several months living in an Atlanta halfway house for recovering addicts with the suspect.

Long was charged on Wednesday with eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault in the Tuesday night shootings.

Bayless, who says he was being treated for drug addiction, said he was in a halfway house named Maverick Recovery with Long in late 2019 and early 2020, and last saw Long in February 2020.

He said Long had been treated for sex addiction and that he frequented massage parlors ""for explicitly sexual activity.""

Bayless said Long was ""deeply religious"" and would become ""very emotionally distraught that he frequented these places.""

""In the halfway house he would describe several of his sexual addiction 'relapses' as he called them. He would have a deep feeling of remorse and shame and say he needed to return to prayer and to return to God,"" he said.

Reuters called Maverick Recovery but the facility was not open.

Law enforcement officials said Long may have been struggling with a sex addiction that he presented as his motive for violence that primarily targeted minority women.

Authorities did not discount the possibility that the attacks were inspired at least in part by an anti-immigrant or anti-Asian sentiment, or some personal grievance.

Six of the eight victims were women of Asian descent. A white woman and white man were also among those killed.

Long’s mugshot released by authorities showed him with a chin beard, short hair on the sides of his head, and longer hair on the top, some reaching his eyes.

Long graduated from Sequoyah High School in Canton, Georgia in 2017, a Cherokee County School District spokeswoman said.

The Daily Beast reported that an Instagram account appearing to belong to Long, but which was no longer active, contained a tagline that read: ""Pizza, guns, drums, music, family, and God. This pretty much sums up my life. It’s a pretty good life.""

Elders at the Crabapple First Baptist Church, which Long attended in nearby Milton, Georgia, issued a statement expressing grief over the shootings.

""We are heartbroken for all involved. We grieve for the victims and their families, and we continue to pray for them,” the statement said. “Moreover, we are distraught for the Long family and continue to pray for them as well.""

The church appeared to have disabled its Facebook page, which had contained a 2018 video clip in which Long talked about his baptism and youth group in the seventh grade when a speaker discussed the biblical parable of the prodigal son, according to the Daily Beast.

""The son goes off and squanders all that he has and lives completely for himself and then, when he finds he’s wanting to eat pig food, he realized there’s something wrong and he goes back to his father and his father runs back to him and embraces him,"" Long said in the clip.

""And by the grace of God I was able to draw the connection there and realize this is a story between what happened with me and God.""

Long’s family did not respond to a request for comment. The family facilitated the arrest, according to the Cherokee County Sheriff’s Department.

That’s why, in all of the on-air discussions about the appalling murder of Sarah Everard this week, I have been very careful to bring it back to the unimaginable loss suffered by her family and friends.

5 Sarah Everard was the catalyst for the fight to end violence against women Credit: PA

She was clearly a much-loved and thoroughly kind, funny and decent young woman but her family have been distressed at the way their daughter has been politicised.

One of Sarah’s best friends wrote a heartbreaking article that reduced me to tears.

Helen Edwards mentions the vigil on Clapham Common for Sarah and says initially she was looking forward to attending, as it was a way to express her love for her and sorrow about what had happened.

She subsequently changed her mind about going, along with many other of Sarah’s friends, because they believed her death was being “hijacked” and were dismayed that it didn’t feel it was a tribute to Sarah any more.

Helen is also at pains to stress that all men should not be demonised after Sarah’s alleged abduction and murder, and doesn’t think what happened to her friend is a symptom of a sexist and dangerous society.

She wants to make it clear that Sarah had “many wonderful men in her life” and wouldn’t have wanted them to be “smeared with the same brush as her attacker”.

Helen is also incensed over the idea of a curfew for men after dark, calling it “one of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard”, and firmly believes Sarah would have agreed. I respect Helen’s point of view, but the stories from so many women of being groped, verbally and physically abused and sexually harassed and assaulted that emerged in the wake of Sarah’s murder have made us all realise this state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue.

5 So join the fight but don't lose sight of Sarah, writes Lorraine Kelly Credit: PA

Sarah’s death opened the floodgates to anger, frustration and a desire for change among women who don’t want to put up with this crap any more.

And of course, the scenes at Clapham Common, when police were shamefully heavy handed, made feelings run even higher.

I totally understand that Sarah’s family want to mourn quietly and with dignity.

I agree with Helen that most men are decent, loving and caring and would be appalled at the casual sexism demonstrated by Neanderthals and morons, as well as those who prey on young girls and women.

None of us wants to make this any harder for Sarah’s family and friends, and what we need now are cool heads and a coherent plan to educate those men who sadly need to be told what is and what is not acceptable behaviour.

The power of drag

HUGE congratulations to Lawrence Chaney, pictured, crowned the winner of the second series of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK.

Full disclosure – I am a superfan and one of the proudest moments of my career was sitting on the judges’ panel beside the glorious RuPaul, who happens to be even more drop-dead gorgeous in real life. Along with Michelle Visage and Alan Carr, we all had the best fun we’ve ever had while keeping our clothes on.

5 Lawrence Chaney won the second series of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK Credit: BBC

And can we just talk about the contestants’ outfits, make-up, accessories, singing, dancing, acting and of course, their heart-rending stories of being bullied and misunderstood but ultimately triumphing? This show has it all. It’s funny, sassy and hugely entertaining but has such a big heart. It shows how the power of drag can change lives and bring us joy.

I can’t wait to see what all of the queens will do next and I thank every single one of them for making me sob in sympathy and howl with laughter.

All I have to say to them is good luck and don’t f*** it up – and roll on series three.

Haz & Meg Oprah is ongoing

I AM honestly baffled by Harry and Meghan.

Not content with having their say on Oprah, the “fiercely private” couple gave details of a personal phone call between Harry and his brother and father.

5 Meghan and Harry during their royal tell-all with Oprah Winfrey Credit: VIA REUTERS

If they really want to build bridges it just doesn’t make sense to let the world know that the talks were “unproductive”.

It seems highly unlikely this juicy gossip would have been spilled by Gayle King, a hugely influential TV presenter and Oprah’s best friend, without Harry and Meghan’s say-so.

Once again the story made global headlines as they must surely have known it would.

The couple were well aware that the Queen wanted all of the furore and fallout over issues raised in the interview to be dealt with privately, and for the family to hopefully arrive at some sort of solution, and then to show the world a united front.

Instead, William and Charles will be feeling extremely uneasy about picking up the phone to Harry again in case their words are leaked to the US media.

If Harry and Meghan genuinely still want to be part of his family and have some sort of relationship with them, this just doesn’t add up.

It reeks of point scoring, and I think they are better than that.

Just as well Prince Philip is a very old man and still recuperating from a heart operation.

He would no doubt have given grandson Harry the kind of hairdryer b*****king that would put Fergie to shame (obviously I mean the legendary Manchester United manager, not Harry’s boisterous aunty).

They all need to get a grip and keep things in the family while they still have a royal dynasty to hang on to.

Allen story must be heard

I WOULD urge you to watch Allen V Farrow, a recently released and extremely harrowing four-part documentary.

I do not believe you will ever want to watch a Woody Allen movie ever again.

5 I would urge you to watch documentary Allen V Farrow Credit: �2021 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO� and all related programs are the p

I’ve always found this director/actor/writer intensely irritating and extremely creepy, but he has a deeply devoted following, especially among the self-proclaimed New York intelligentsia, who hail him as a genius.

When I watched his film Manhattan, released in 1979, I was 20 years old and found it really unsettling. To me, he was just a dirty old man having far too much of a good time playing the middle-aged lover of a 17-year-old, a part he had written for himself.

What made it all even queasier was that with Allen directing, it was the teenager, played by Mariel Hemingway, who would instigate the sex, and 42-year-old Allen was all awkward and reluctant.

Allen famously had a 12-year relationship with movie star Mia Farrow, who was previously married to Frank Sinatra and the conductor Andre Previn.

Mia had three biological sons with Previn and the couple adopted three daughters, including Soon-Yi from South Korea. Mia then went on to adopt a son, Moses, and a daughter, Dylan, and gave birth to a biological son, Ronan, with Allen.

Ronan is now a campaigning investigative journalist, largely responsible for bringing down Harvey Weinstein. And this is important, because in 1992 Dylan told her mum that Allen had sexually assaulted her. She was seven years old.

The case was never brought to trial because the authorities did not want to put Dylan on the stand to testify, as they believed it would have been too much of an ordeal for such a young child.

Mia’s reputation was trashed by Allen, who labelled her a “woman scorned” who was out for revenge because he had an affair with her daughter.

Yes, you heard me right.

This gruesome gargoyle began sleeping with Mia’s daughter Soon-Yi, who is 35 years younger than him.

He was still in a relationship with Mia at the time and Soon-Yi was at college.

Mia discovered the affair when she found what she claims were “pornographic” Polaroid photos of her daughter taken by Allen.

Some months later seven-year-old Dylan told her mother about the abuse she says she had suffered.

I have no doubts at all that Dylan was telling the truth, and have always believed her, but for a long time she was a voice in the wilderness.

She has since managed to rebuild her life, get married and they have a little girl of their own. Meanwhile, Allen was still basking in the praise of the Hollywood elite.

There’s one particularly nauseating scene in the documentary that shows the great and the good at the Oscars giving him a standing ovation. After that, Dylan wrote a searing article about being abused which was only really taken into account after #MeToo – and that’s when Hollywood A-listers began to turn on Allen.

It’s a story that Hollywood producers would probably dismiss as too outlandish – but Dylan deserves to be heard.

Since telling the world her “beloved soulmate of 20 years” was leaving the family, Alice has accused her husband of “gaslighting” her and made a dig about his fake posing in a selfie.

Now, in the latest instalment, she says Ioan is “winding the s*** up me” in their separation negotiations.

Yesterday, in a video posted on Instagram, 49-year-old Alice said they were working on a “collaborative” divorce, which she describes as a cross between a “kind way of doing” it and a “phenomenal scam.”

She told her 59,000 followers: “My husband’s winding the s* up me saying what he says is the law.

“If I want my daughter to stay one more night, the court hasn’t said anything, so I can do it.”

For a couple who were seen to have one of the strongest marriages in Hollywood and led a quiet life in LA, her revelation in January that Fantastic Four star Ioan was leaving was shocking.

But worse was to come. She accused him of deleting her tweet and “mentally torturing” her. Since then she has worn her broken heart on her sleeve, regularly updating the world on her grief.

In showbiz, this sort of public unravelling of a marriage is almost unheard of.

But Alice, a British actress who was born in the US state of New Jersey, seems to have nowhere else to go.

'MARRY ME OR LOSE ME'

Explaining her actions, she said: “I don’t have a mum, or a dad. I don’t have any close friends in LA. I’ve looked after my kids for half their lives alone.”

The pair fell in love on the set of the movie 102 Dalmatians in 2000.

Alice said at the time she had met “my decent man, who did, unbelievably, turn out to love me as much as I loved him.”

They dated for seven years before she told him: Marry me or lose me.

Ioan, 47, whose most recent British TV appearance was in ITV’s gripping date rape drama Liar, finally popped the question on New Year’s Eve, 2006.

12 Ioan previously bonded with his co-star Ella Newton who plays his daughter

He said afterwards: “Alice has been very patient with my procrastinating.

“She did give me somewhat of an ultimatum — a gentle nudge — which was the best thing she could do.”

He then proved himself worthy of the name Mr Fantastic — his Marvel films’ character — by saying he was “heavily involved” in the wedding planning.

The Welsh hunk and Alice married in Los Cabos, Mexico, in 2007, both of them in Armani.

Despite never intending to live in LA, Ioan found himself in demand.

After a small part as Fifth Officer Lowe in Titanic, he began his rise to fame with the lead role in ITV’s historical naval series Hornblower, which aired from 1998 to 2003.

He went on to appear in movies King Arthur, the Fantastic Four franchise and 2008 family drama Fireflies In The Garden with Ryan Reynolds.

Alice worked mainly in US TV, with roles in Lost, The Mentalist and Brothers And Sisters. Most recently, she has played villainous Esther Mikaelson in The Vampire Diaries.

They were often kept apart by filming schedules which delayed their plans to start a family.

12 Alice took to Instagram to post this message of heartbreak

In a newspaper article charting her journey to becoming a parent, Alice wrote: “Acting jobs are like buses — none come and then three arrive all at the same time, usually shooting on opposite sides of the world.

“There’s never a right time to breathe that long sigh of relief that says: ‘I think I’m ready now.’”

And when they were ready, plans didn’t go as smoothly as they hoped.

Alice wrote: “The whole of my 38th year was spent reading studies about fertility, taking my morning temperature, planning ovulation graphs, standing on my head after sex, and fastidiously avoiding tea, coffee, alcohol, pineapple pizza and anything else I’d read about that might possibly prevent pregnancy.”

They considered adoption but went for IVF, spending £7,000 on a 20 per cent chance of having a baby. It worked first time.

When Ella Betsi, now 11, arrived, Alice realised: “It was as close to being in heaven as I’d ever get.”

And Ioan was equally delighted, saying: “Life couldn’t be better.”

It took another eight IVF cycles to produce their second daughter, Elsie Marigold, now seven.

Alice, never one for keeping tight-lipped, did what she could for the #MeToo movement when Harvey Weinstein faced accusations of sexual assault.

In an article about meeting the Hollywood bigwig at a party, she said he had found it “sinister” when he asked her to go to the bathroom with him.

Alice claimed Weinstein made a comment about Ioan’s career, having just auditioned him for a role. Neither he nor Alice were ever considered for one of Weinstein’s films again.

Ioan said afterwards: “I was very proud of Alice. Women were not being believed so she wanted to help bolster the case.”

12 Alice spoke up for women saying 'we all have right to free speech'

Ioan’s career has taken him away from the family home, filming Liar in the UK between 2017 and 2020, and three spells spent Down Under shooting Aussie TV series Harrow.

Last year he said: “I think we’ve struggled the past four years making time for each other because physically we’re apart.”

Meanwhile, Alice has been at home, bringing up the girls.

She wrote in one of her recent Instagram posts: “I’ve looked after my kids for half their lives alone. My husband knows that.”

Announcing the news of their split at the end of January, she wrote on social media: “Me and our young daughters are very confused and sad. We haven’t been given a reason except that he ‘no longer loves me.’”

Divorce papers now show they had separated on New Year’s Day. After that initial post vanished, Alice told the world her husband had deleted it, accusing him of “gaslighting” her.

She wrote: “I didn’t delete the tweet from a few hours ago about him leaving. He did. From my account.”

“And hell yes, when I am being gaslit and mentally tortured then hell yes I will wash my linen in public.”

‘I AM BEING GASLIT & MENTALLY TORTURED’

That tweet was then also deleted. The following day, the pair issued a joint statement which asked for privacy at this “difficult” time.

Some jumped to the conclusion Ioan may have become close to another woman.

A source told The Sun: “Within the industry there are a lot of raised eyebrows about whether things might be to do with his time working away in Australia.”

He had previously gushed about bonding with his co-star Ella Newton, 30, who plays his daughter in the series, saying: “You can’t take your eyes off her when she’s on screen.”

Ella, who has a boyfriend, used to play Delaney ­Renshaw — a Lolita character who tried to seduce an older man — in ­Aussie soap Neighbours.

There is no suggestion Ioan was unfaithful.

Last month Alice posted a picture of a broken heart and wrote that the “pain is excruciating but I am stronger than an ox.”

Two days later came another lengthy post, accompanied by a picture of the couple from happier times.

She told her critics: “You just want a reason to put me down. Please — go ahead. I’m impenetrable.”

The pair have held some crisis talks, which have progressed from intense and heated to “playful”.

A source said: “Obviously, it has been very frosty for some time especially with her Twitter posts.

“Alice’s statements made it really clear how tough they have found things over the last few months but their friends all hope they can find a way through this somehow.”

'REALLY BAD MOVE'

At the start of this month, Alice reposted a news piece confirming Ioan has filed for divorce and captioned it: “Oh. Ok. Thanks for letting me know. I guess?”

Two days later, a throwback black and white selfie appeared on her social media of Alice leaning in as if about to kiss Ioan’s cheek while he appears to turn away and look at the camera.

Alice says in her post that he sighed and rolled his eyes before she took the photo — and taking it was a “bad move. Really bad move. Possibly even divorce move.”

This week, Ioan was spotted strolling around Hollywood without his wedding ring.

That is what happened on Friday when the Premier League, English Football League and Women’s Super League clubs, plus cricket and rugby clubs and organisations, started a four-day boycott of social media platforms.

7 Football, cricket and rugby clubs started a four-day boycott of social media on Friday Credit: EPA

They’re switching off Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts to take a stand against online abuse and discrimination.

There is nothing like the power of walking away to say: Enough. The boycott signified our collective anger at the toxic abuse generated on social media and lack of action to make it stop.

I’m on the receiving end of horrendous, vile abuse on a daily basis. In the Wild West of the online world, sexism and misogyny abound.

So does racism, unleashed in torrents by those inadequates buoyed by anonymity.

Even those with the thickest skin can’t help getting ruffled when death and rape threats are made. Not only about us but about family members.

The problem is companies such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, which have the money and technology to monitor, filter and ban abuse, do not do so.

There is nothing like the power of walking away to say: Enough.

If I even glance at a lawnmower online I am forever inundated with lawnmower ads. It is hard to believe they cannot ­create algorithms that automatically screen out abuse, certain phrases and words.

These companies have branded themselves platforms, not publishers, which means they cannot be held responsible for the comments made. That has to change, because only when it does will they focus on resolving the problem.

The reporting system needs to change too. Currently it is challenging enough to make it feel like it’s not worth the bother. It takes ages to get a reply.

7 Clubs have united to take a stand against online abuse and discrimination Credit: AP

All too often no action is taken and even the police struggle to get the names and addresses of the abuser to take legal action.

As a result, I often turn a blind eye but sometimes it’s too much to ignore.

The other day I reported a particularly disgusting tweet detailing graphic and deeply disturbing suggestions of what should be done to me sexually.

It involved the use of the vile phrase “spit-roasting” and sex toys. I tell you this detail just to show you how graphic it was.

But when I reported it to Twitter, I was told that the message did not violate its rules, which is mind-boggling.

Many of my players and colleagues at West Ham are on the receiving end of horrific, often racist, attacks daily.

Social media can be a power for good. But it can also be dangerous and damaging. Until we can rely on individuals to behave better, there needs to be a system to ban people who behave badly.

TOXIC ABUSE

Boycotting social media companies will hopefully encourage them to take action and to do more to eradicate online hate, such as active filtering, blocking and swiftly removing offensive posts.

There need to be real-life consequences for people who think it is acceptable to peddle toxic abuse.

Until action is taken by them we have no choice but to take action ourselves. Sure, boycott action from sport in isolation will not eradicate online abuse.

But it is important to take a stand. The only way we can push to establish meaningful change on social media platforms is to stage a boycott, which is sad really, as lots of people use it to be in contact with their clubs and to follow player news.

The problem with online abuse is that it strays into the real world very quickly.

Online abuse of women is rife. There isn’t a name I haven’t been called, a threat that hasn’t been made towards me, just for being a woman.

Many women are threatened with ­violence and threats so frequently it can have the (presumably intended) effect of silencing them, not only on social media but in other spaces.

It can force women out of politics or public life, such as the 18 women parliamentarians in the UK who in 2019 decided not to run for re-election.

It’s an extremely sad reflection on our society that abuse is so commonplace and people think it is OK.

We should all adhere to the idea that if you wouldn’t say something to someone’s face, then don’t say it on social media.

Until that happens, social media companies need to take responsibility and come down on online abuse like a ton of bricks.

'Uncomfortable' for Bafta

IT can’t be easy to come forward to accuse a Bafta-winning actor and producer of harassment, groping and bullying.

But that’s what 20 women have done, over the way they claim they were treated by Noel Clarke.

7 Noel Clarke has been accused of harassing 20 women Credit: Getty

Described as a “sexual predator”, he has been accused of covertly filming a nude audition by a young actress without her consent, exposing himself to a woman in the back of a limo, groping a women in a lift, sexually propositioning and threatening women, as well as pressuring women to perform sex scenes in the nude.

His friend claims he has been “vilified” because “no one likes it when a man of colour gets to the top”.

What a load of nonsense. These claims transcend this. This has nothing to do with race but everything to do with listening to women and giving them a proper hearing.

Noel has denied all the accusations but apologised to colleagues who feel “uncomfortable” about any of his behaviour. Bafta will be feeling uncomfortable after having to strip him of his recent award.

A fat lot of sense

I KNOW we have an obesity crisis in this country. But I do not agree with the latest expert view that severely obese people should be refused junk food at fast-food restaurants.

Steve Miller, who presented Sky One’s slimming series Fat Families, appeared on Good Morning Britain suggesting we adopt a “tough love” approach to obesity.

7 Steve Miller says severely obese people should be refused junk food at fast-food restaurants Credit: Steve Miller

The author claimed we need to “be cruel to be kind” when it comes to serving unhealthy food.

But this does not feel like a very sustainable solution to the obesity crisis.

Aside from the question of whether fat-shaming people, and treating them like children, would cure them (unlikely), it would be unrealistic to ask restaurant workers to become the fat police. Like asking off-licences not to serve alcohol.

Surely prevention is better than cure.

It’s all about education, support, knowing how to cook healthy meals and encouraging people to be active.

Labour home truths IS it any wonder Labour are so focused on “cash for curtains” and the refurb of Boris Johnson’s Downing Street flat – which they spent a load on refurbishing under Tony Blair? The country is ahead on vaccines and getting back to normal, and the Conservatives have an 11-point lead over Labour. I know some people (mostly Labour politicians) are up in arms about whoever initially paid for the redecoration of Boris’s flat. But maybe the most important point is that he has paid the money back in full. I am more up in arms that the Tory party didn’t pay for it to begin with. BJ doesn’t own the house, it is a working home and, frankly, our Prime Minster does deserve to live somewhere with his young family that’s reasonably presentable.

A few choice words

OH dear. It seems the Duke of York has once again exercised his dodgy judgment – by going into business with Harry Keogh, a former Coutts banker who was accused of sexual harassment.

Keogh left the Queen’s bank in March 2018 after he was accused of touching a female colleague inappropriately and boasting about his sexual exploits.

It is claimed some female staff refused to work with him.

The source described him as “the Duke’s private banker for some 20 years”.

Worshippers rushed to protect the church where the Ark is said to be secured after violent clashes between soldiers and rebel militia neared the site.

Christians in the eastern African country claim the sacred Ark is being kept under guard at the Church of St Mary of Zion in Axum - Ethiopia's holiest city in the Tigray region.

Up to 800 people are believed to have been killed during the massacre, which took place in November.

News of the bloodbath has only now emerged as the region has been cut off from outsiders, with Ethiopia's prime minister Abiy Ahmed shutting down internet and mobile networks.

He has deployed his country's army against the leadership of the region.

Getu Mak, a local university lecturer, recounted how many rushed to defend the Ark.

The 32-year-old told the Times: ""When people heard the shooting they ran to the church to give support to the priests and others who were there protecting the ark.

""Certainly some of them were killed for doing that.""

A deacon who lives in Axum has told how he helped count the bodies, gathered victim's ID cards and assisted with burials in mass graves.

He believes around 800 people were killed at and around the church by pro-government forces, with bodies left on the city's street for days.

Getu said reports of troops destroying and stealing artefacts since conflicts began in November had prompted fears the Ark would be taken to another city or that it would disappear completely.

He added: ""There was no mercy shown, they didn’t care if you were young, old, whatever.

""They killed people and took everything they could — from the electronics shop, the bars. There were many corpses.""

What is the Ark of the Covenant? THE Ark is said to be a gold-covered wooden chest containing two stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments - which Moses brought down from Mount Sinai - are written. It is also said to contain other Biblical items such as Aaron’s rod, which is thought to have magical powers. Since it vanished there have been several theories as to where the Ark is now, including Mount Nebo in Jordan, southern Africa, Ethiopia, Egypt and even several locations in Europe. Christian monks in the African country of Ethiopia have long-claimed the Ark is being kept under guard at the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum. According to the Old Testament, the Ark was held at the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem for centuries but vanished after Jerusalem was sacked in 586 or 587BC. It is believed by Ethiopia's Orthodox Christians that the ark was taken to Axum in the 10th century BC by Menelik - the son of the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon of Israel. For the past five decades it is said to have been secured in the Chapel of the Tablet in the holy of city of Axum - with only a solitary monk allowed access. But, research by Bible Archaeology, Search & Exploration Institute tells a different tale. According to BASE, the Ark was taken out of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem during the reign of Manasseh where it was first taken to a Jewish colony on Elephantine Island in Egypt. After that it is thought it was taken down the Nile to Lake Tana in Ethiopia and in particular Tana Kirkos Island, which is considered to be a holy island only populated by Christian monks. From there the Ark was then moved to Axum, or Aksum, a city in the north of the country.

Ethnic violence over things such as land and resources has been a ongoing issue under Abiy Ahmed. He became Prime Minister in April 2018.

In late November, Ahmed declared victory against the TPLF after pro-government forces took control of the regional capital, Mekele.

His government denied the involvement of Eritrea but recently backed down on its claim that no civilians had been killed in the campaign..

The foreign ministry admitted that ""rape, plunder, callous and intentional mass killings"" could occur in conflict where ""many are illegally armed"".

It blamed the Tigrayan militia for leaving the region ""vulnerable"".

Humanitarian organisations have warned of a possible hunger crisis on the same scale seen before during the 1980s.

According to the UN, 80 per cent of Tigray's population of six million is cut off from help.

In December, at least 102 civilians were reportedly massacred in an outbreak ethnic violence in Ethiopia.

Local reports said the Ethiopian army had responded by killing at least 42 militants in the western region of Benishangul-Gumuz.

The attack on civilians came a day after a visit by prime minister Abiy Ahmed - 2019's Nobel peace prize winner - who called for armed rebels to be brought to justice.

Ethiopia's Human Rights Commission warned in November of the “unrelenting pace” of attacks in the region.

In 2019, Ahmed was awarded the £730,000 Nobel Peace Prize for his work to end the 20-year conflict with Eritrea.

However he is battling unrest across his own country, which is riven by tensions between the more than 80 ethnic groups.

Newly-released court documents show the amount that former model Kathryn Mayorga is seeking from the footballer.

It comes after she accused him of sexually assaulting her in a Las Vegas hotel room after meeting on a night out in 2009, when she was 25.

Ronaldo vehemently denies the allegation.

She wants £18m for “past pain and suffering”, £18m for “future pain and suffering” and £18m in punitive damages, the Mirror reports.

The 37-year-old’s expenses rack up to £1.4m.

That includes legal fees of £1.1m.

And it means the grand total is a whopping £56.5m – equal to two years of the Juventus star’s salary.

In 2010, Ms Mayorga accepted $375,000 - £270,000 - as part of an out-of-court non-disclosure settlement.

But three years ago, Ms Mayorga filed a civil lawsuit in Las Vegas saying she had been “mentally incapacitated” when she agreed to it.

And she claims she signed it under duress.

New legal documents exclusively revealed by The Sun show Ms Mayorga's legal team demanded to grill Ronaldo over the matter via Zoom.

Her lawyers filed a list of 60 witnesses they want to testify.

Also on the list are three police officers who investigated the original complaint, Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli, ­Ronaldo’s agent Jorge Mendes and adviser Andy Quinn.

Ronaldo has said: “I firmly deny the accusations being issued against me.

""Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in.

""Keen as I may be to clear my name, I refuse to feed the media spectacle created by people seeking to promote themselves at my expense.""

On the night in question, Ronaldo, then 24, was in Vegas on holiday with his brother-in-law and cousin.

Ms Mayorga, who worked Rain nightclub inside the Palms Casino Resort, says she met Ronaldo in the venue’s VIP area.

He then invited her and a friend to his penthouse suite – room 57306 at the Palms – “to enjoy the view of the Las Vegas Strip”, she claims.

The luxurious suite featured a jacuzzi on the balcony.

Ms Mayorga claims she refused to get into the hot tub because she did not want to ruin her dress.

She said Ronaldo offered her some clothes to wear and told her to change in a bathroom.

The court papers claim that while she was changing Ronaldo walked in and exposed himself before asking her to perform a sex act.

Ms Mayorga says she then kissed him after refusing to engage in the sex act on the condition that he would let her go.

According to Ms Mayorga, after he pulled her into the bedroom and raped her, Ronaldo told her he was a “good guy” except for the “one per cent”.

Court documents lodged by her lawyers state Ms Mayorga had refused Ronaldo’s advances while screaming: “No, no, no”.

Ms Mayorga reported the alleged crime to Las Vegas cops the next day but refused to name Ronaldo.

She later decided not to prosecute and signed the non-disclosure agreement in January 2010.

Despite acknowledging the existence of the NDA, his lawyers maintained that it was ""by no means a confession of guilt"".

But in September 2018, as the #MeToo movement broke out, Ms Mayorga broke the agreement by giving an interview, resulting in Las Vegas Police reopening the case.

The Clark County District Attorney's office announced in 2019 that it would not prosecute Ronaldo.

In a statement, it said: “Based upon a review of the information presented at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

""Therefore, no charges will be forthcoming.”

Ronaldo strongly denies the claims and has called them “fake news”, claiming the sex was consensual.

Sarah Everard, a marketing manager, should have made it back to her Brixton home by about 10pm on Wednesday night - but hasn't been seen since.

And in a ""shocking and deeply disturbing"" update to the case, Scotland Yard last night revealed a police officer had been arrested over Sarah's disappearance.

The Sun can today reveal Wayne Couzens, an armed diplomatic protection officer based in Westminster, was arrested at his Kent home.

His work saw him provide protection at major public events attended by senior members of the Royal Family with the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command also responsible for guarding Downing Street and the Palace of Westminster.

Met Police this afternoon confirmed a serving officer was arrested last night on suspicion of kidnap.

They said he was further arrested today on suspicion of murder and a separate allegation of indecent exposure.

PC Couzens is thought to have been a late entrant to the police, joining around 10 years ago after previously working at a family garage repairs business in Dover.

One ex-colleague of PC Couzens said: ""It is truly shocking that he has been arrested over Sarah's disappearance.""

However despite the arrest, the Met said Ms Everard had not yet been found.

Detectives investigating Sarah’s disappearance are also today carrying out a search of his locker at the police base in the Palace of Westminster where he worked.

Following the arrest of the police officer, the Metropolitan Police has made a referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.

Neighbour David Ladd, 48, said he saw Couzens bundled into a police car under arrest with handcuffs on last night.

He told The Sun: “He was escorted into the back of a police car.”

Cops are now standing guard at a Kent home with a forensic tent set up outside, with a car seized from outside the property.

A woman in her 30s - believed to be the cop's partner - was also been arrested at the same location on suspicion of assisting an offender. She remains in custody.

Corrine Couzens, Wayne’s step-mother, told The Sun she couldn't comment but added: ""I'm aware of what's happening.""

Cops were today seen searching locations in London and Kent including a property in Deal and an area of woodland near Ashford.

Officers have been combing through through bushes at a disused paintball centre and a golf driving range.

Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave last night said the arrest was a ""serious and significant development"".

AC Ephgrave said: ""We will continue to work with all speed on this investigation but the fact that the arrested man is a serving Metropolitan Police officer is both shocking and deeply disturbing.

""I understand there will be significant public concern but it is essential that the investigative team are given the time and space to continue their work.""

The Directorate of Professional Standards is aware and Sarah's family has been kept updated of these developments, police said.

'IT'S HORRIFYING'

And as cops searched the officer's Kent home, neighbours spoke of their shock.

A neighbour in the road said a police officer lives at the address with his ""chatty"" wife and two children.

She said: ""They just seemed like a normal, regular family, there was nothing strange about them at all.""

Pamela Cane, 77, who lives opposite, described the household as “the perfect family”.

She said Wayne lived there with his wife, two young children and a Pug dog.

She said her late partner Rod would discuss policing with Wayne - who she described as “very friendly” and part of a “perfect family”.

She said: “The whole situation is horrifying.

“I can’t believe this. The arrest is more shocking because he’s a police officer.

“Wayne would also fix bikes in his garage. He was known for helping people with them.”

A woman who lives nearby was walking past Couzens’ home about 8pm last night when she saw him arrested by about 25 plain clothes police officers outside the property.

The neighbour told The Sun: “There were two officers at the door and some more positioned to the side of the house.""

FINGERTIP SEARCH

Sarah was last seen on Wednesday night - seen on a doorbell camera on the Poynders Road section of the South Circular - about halfway between her friend's house and her own flat.

Detectives searching for the missing marketing executive earlier cordoned off a main road to search a housing complex close to where Sarah's phone last pinged.

Officers carried out fingertip searches around Clapham Common where Sarah was last seen, while divers and sniffer dogs checked ponds and drains in the area.

And police have appealed for motorists who may have driving near her route home to send in their dash-cam footage.

Police yesterday released new pictures of missing Sarah hoping that it might encourage anyone with information to come forward.

One shows Sarah wearing the same coat as on the night she went missing.

Sarah’s parents left their York home at the weekend and drove to London to help the search for their daughter.

Her distraught family fear ""bad people approached her"" as her ""very worried"" boyfriend issued a desperate plea.

Her uncle Nick Everard also revealed the family are ""absolutely distraught"" - and said they were ""baffled"" by the arrest.

He told the Sun Online: ""We know they arrested an armed officer but we don't know him.

""It’s really shocked us all.

He had earlier pleaded with any potential abductor to ""just to be human and to let her come home"".

Nick added: “If someone is holding her against her will I would plead with them just to be human and to let her come home, to let her talk to us, give us a ring or text to let us know she is OK.""

It is understood detectives investigating her disappearance have been told of assaults on women in the area, reports The Times.

In January, Metropolitan Police received a report of sexual harassment on a young female on Hydethorpe Road, just half a mile from where Sarah was last caught on CCTV.

At the start of February, a woman was witnessed being chased by a man just over a mile away.

Then, just three weeks ago, a 14-year-old girl was followed by a man in a van less than half a mile from where Sarah was last seen.

Meanwhile, other women said they reported groups of men following a woman in neighbouring district Balham.

But Scotland Yard has said it is so far not linking Sarah's disappearance to any other incidents.

Alarmed women living in the area revealed police urged them to be vigilant after the mysterious disappearance.

One said cops knocked on her door last night and warned her ""not to go out alone"" as they desperately try to piece together what happened.

Another woman, aged in her 30s, told The Sun Online: “I was told to be more careful because I live on my own.

“The police came round yesterday and said to be careful.

“I don’t want to leave the house at the moment. You don’t know what happened.

“It makes me very worried. I just can’t believe it.”

On Wednesday night last week, Sarah left a friend's house in Leathwaite Road in Clapham about 9pm.

She headed through a back gate onto the A205 South Circular before she is believed to have walked across Clapham Common.

She had spoken to her partner on the phone for about 15 minutes, and has not been heard from since that point, according to her friend Rose Woollard.

Sarah moved to the capital for work around 12 years ago and has a brother, James, and sister, Katie, who also live in London.

In a statement released over the weekend, her family said: ""With every day that goes by we are getting more worried about Sarah.

""She is always in regular contact with us and with her friends and it is totally out of character for her to disappear like this.

""We long to see her and want nothing more than for her to be found safe and well.

""We are so grateful to the police and all our friends for all they are doing.

""We are desperate for news and if anyone knows anything about what has happened to her, we would urge you to please come forward and speak to the police.

""No piece of information is too insignificant.""

Sarah’s sister, Katie, added on Facebook: “No words. Please share and contact me if you hear anything.”

The now-deleted article cited women’s “physical attractiveness”, “sexy body shapes” and “charming personalities” as factors that “lead to sexual harassment” from men.

It urged women to “avoid working overtime” if they work alone, as they would be asking to be sexually harassed, while telling them to watch out how they communicate and behave to “avoid being misinterpreted”.

The article was published on the official online platform of Malaysia’s health ministry, which provides daily updates on Covid-19 cases and vaccination.

The article was first published in 2016 but came to public attention this week after outraged Twitter users raised it with opposition politician Hannah Yeoh, a former deputy minister of women, family and community development affairs.

“This is absolutely wrong,” Yeoh said in a post, calling for the article to be removed from the health ministry’s website.

Female activists and journalists also criticised the ministry for its outdated approach.

Writer Boo Su-Lyn tweeted: “Men engage in sexual harassment by abusing their power over women in the workplace. It has nothing to do with the way women dress.”

Malaysia is not alone in its antiquated approach to sexual harassment as last week Pakistan’s prime minister Imran Khan faced a backlash after telling women to “cover up” to avoid rape.

In a weekend TV appearance, Oxford-educated Khan, 68, advised women to cover up to prevent temptation for men who lacked ""willpower"".

Hundreds have now signed a statement calling Khan's comments ""factually incorrect, insensitive and dangerous"".

""Fault rests solely with the rapist and the system that enables the rapist, including a culture fostered by statements such as those made by Khan,"" the statement said.

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan - an independent rights watchdog - said it was ""appalled"" by the comments.

Responding to the public backlash against the article on sexual harassment, the Malaysian health ministry’s director-general Noor Hisham Abdullah told the Malay Mail newspaper on Wednesday that the piece had created “a negative perception” and that it was purely based on the author’s personal opinions.

He added that it has since been deleted and the ministry had taken steps to review previous articles published on its portal, reported Vice.

Following the outrage, social media users found other articles on health ministry’s website that demeaned working women as well as LGBTQ Malaysians.

Protesters first took to the streets on March 21, 2021, and again on March 26, 2021 to demonstrate against the new Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill - with demonstrations then taking place in other cities across the country in later days.

What is the new Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill?

The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill would give forces in England and Wales more power to impose conditions on non-violent protests.

That includes those deemed too noisy or a nuisance, with fines or jail for those convicted.

Police chiefs will be able to impose conditions such as a start and finish time and noise limit on a static protest.

The police already have the power to put such conditions on marches.

A description on the Government website says: ""This measure will broaden the range of circumstances in which the police can impose conditions on protests, including a single person protest, to include where noise causes a significant impact on those in the vicinity or serious disruption to the running of an organisation.

""This measure will close a loophole which some protesters exploit.""

It will allow police to give hefty fines to offenders if the Bill becomes law.

Failure to comply with police directions on how the protest is conducted could land a fine of up to £2,500.

What are the 'Kill the Bill' protests?

""Kill the Bill"" is in response to government plans to give police more power to impose restrictions on protests through the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill.

It has been debated and voted on in Parliament and at the time of the protest on March 21 had moved to the committee stage in the House of Lords.

On the night of Sunday, March 21, a peaceful protest turned violent as masked thugs smashed up a police station and attacked officers during a ""disgusting"" riot in Bristol.

A ""mob of animals"" left cops with broken arms and ribs, set fire to police vans and hurled fireworks during violent clashes.

The crowd shouted “Shame on you” as at least two police vehicles were set on fire, while others were smashed up, daubed with graffiti and had their tyres let down.

Yobs armed with baseball bats also smashed glass panels of Bristol’s Bridewell police station while officers in riot gear, others on horseback and police dogs attempted to disperse the baying crowd.

Protesters wore masks and carried placards that read: “Say no to UK police state”, “Freedom to protest is fundamental to democracy” and “Kill the Bill”.

Mass gatherings are currently banned because of the pandemic.

But thousands turned up despite officers strongly advising against doing so.

Home Secretary Priti Patel took to Twitter to slam the protest, saying: ""Unacceptable scenes in Bristol. Thuggery and disorder by a minority will never be tolerated.

""Our police officers put themselves in harms way to protect us all. My thoughts this evening are with those police officers injured.""

And again on March 26, protests turned violent once again.

Riot cops used shields to push back thousands of booing demonstrators who threw the fireworks along with bottles and eggs at police on the third night of chaos in less than a week.

The latest riot saw 10 people arrested.

One of the detained rioters has since been issued a fixed penalty notice while the other nine remain in custody, cops said.

The protests have been held in Bristol over the past week, protesting against the Government's Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill - with 24 people now arrested in total.

And during Friday's demonstrations protesters could be heard chanting ""ten years for protest, five years for rape"" and ""justice for Sarah"", referring to the recent murder of Sarah Everard in London.

It comes after demonstrations on Sunday and Tuesday had also started peacefully before descending into assaults against police and acts of vandalism.

Since then demonstrations have also taken place in a number of cities,.

People gathered in London, Newcastle, Liverpool and Portsmouth, on April 3, with more cities expected to be flooded with campaigners.

Kill the Bill protesters caused mayhem on the night of April 3 by blocking a motorway while violent clashes with cops saw 28 people arrested.

In Bristol protesters sat in the middle of the M32, while in London demonstrators battled with officers on the streets.

The Sun has revealed that demonstrations, not just by Kill the Bill activists, are a huge drain on police resources, costing an estimated £40million a year.

Former police minister Sir Mike Penning said: “This is not about stopping peaceful demonstrations.

""We’ve always cherished our right to protest. But nobody has the right to abuse police officers and bring the country to its knees.""

What is the 'Kill the Bill' petition?

A petition against the Bill has also been launched and will be sent to the National Police Chiefs Council.

Entitled ""Protect Your Freedom To Protest"", it has already been signed more than 206,000 times.

It reads: ""The government is planning to make important changes to the law that will restrict the right to protest when lockdown restrictions ease.

""We oppose this new planned legislation and instead demand that the National Police Chiefs Council adopts a new, eleven-point Charter for Freedom of Assembly Rights – or explain why they refuse to do so.""","['Katie Davis', 'Joseph Gamp']","PROTESTS have been held across the UK, demonstrating against the Government's Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill.

The offender, who The Sun Online can identify as a 32-year-old Nigerian asylum seeker, will serve the jail term in the high security general prison in Nicosia, the island’s capital

He was driven under guard back from the court to the jail after being sentenced on Wednesday.

The Larnaca-Famagusta criminal court heard how the culprit raped the victim after driving her to a remote beach on false pretences.

He then forced her to take laughing gas and cannabis.

Ignoring her pleas to return to the apartment she was staying at in the party resort, he threw her to the ground, pinned her down and raped her as she wept.

The woman did not appear for the closed-door hearing.

She gave a graphic account of how she was violently attacked by the culprit.

He drove her into the countryside when she finished working at an Ayia Napa bar on June 26, 2019.

The victim said the attacker violently raped her despite her begging him to stop.

In the testimony she described how she was raped continuously for at least five minutes on a remote beach near a church.

He then drove her to the apartment she was staying.

One witness described her as being “very upset, she was crying and her hair was messy, and she didn’t speak for a long time"".

After she reported the case to Cypriot authorities the defendant was arrested but claimed the woman had engaged in consensual sex with him.

The 33-year-old had been in a relationship with prison officer Warder Ekaterina Sholokhova, 40, since his release from an 11-year stint in her jail.

Russian police were reportedly investigating whether Kravtsova was raped before she was killed with a scarf.

Sholokhova had left her daughter in the care of her lover in Nelidovo, Tver region, while she was in hospital.

She received a call from her daughter to say she was taking the dog for a walk, she said, but the 13-year-old then failed to answer her messages.

Silnov also stopped answering his phone.

The worried mother asked the emergency services to check her flat, and after breaking in, officers found the girl’s body.

Silnov had disappeared and Ekaterina’s laptop, credit cards and fur coat were missing.

He had reportedly taken a taxi to Rzhev town and vanished.

Silnov is now on Russia’s federal wanted list.

He had been released from jail in 2019 after securing early release from a 15-year sentence for “murder involving rape”.

According to the local Military police, the law student shot himself on April 1, when he was at home in the municipality of Janauba, Brazil, drinking with his friend.

His friend who has not been named, witnessed the 20-year-old's death and told cops Norte called him over to the house to drink alcohol and listen to music.

He said then when he arrived at his house, Nortes had already the .38 calibre revolver in his hand.

The pals played Russian roulette, taking turns to fire the gun with one bullet in the chamber.

He said he received the gun from Nortes twice before the student pulled the trigger again and allegedly shot himself.

The friend, who had known Cades for over six years, added that they had played the game at least four times in the past.

Police said the victim died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound and it is unclear if they are investigating the incident further.

They added that it is not known who the gun belonged to.

Two of his children were born seven months after his 1965 assassination, while other family members witnessed his brutal slaying in Harlem.

How many children did Malcolm X have?

Malcolm X had six children with his wife Betty Shabazz - all of them daughters.

The powerful orator's family is gaining renewed attention in the wake of a deathbed letter from a policeman – which they claim shows the NYPD and FBI conspired in his murder.

Malcolm’s daughters are: Qubilah Shabazz, Attallah Shabazz, Gamilah Lumumba Shabazz, Ilyasah Shabazz, Malaak Shabazz, and Malikah Shabazz.

Qubilah Shabazz

Qubilah Shabazz, 60, witnessed her dad’s horrific assassination as a young girl.

She was just four years old when she and three of her sisters accompanied their pregnant mother on February 21, 1965, to the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem to hear Malcolm X speak.

As they looked on from the audience, he was killed when three gunmen rushed him onstage, shooting him 15 times at close range.

The 39-year-old was pronounced dead on arrival at New York’s Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.

In 1995, Qubilah, the second-eldest daughter of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz, was charged in an alleged plot to assassinate Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, her slain father’s rival.

Her family insisted she had been framed, as she was ""very quiet, almost docile"", according to those close to her.

It transpired that the FBI had agreed to pay an informer $45,000 after he agreed to tape conversations with Malcolm X's daughter.

Her mother had publicly accused Farrakhan of involvement in her husband's killing - but he had issued repeated denials.

Qubilah's defense team had said that the vulnerable woman was lured into the plot.

Months after her arrest, she avoided a trial and a possible prison sentence by agreeing to ""accept responsibility"" for her involvement in the sketchy plot, said the New York Times.

Federal prosecutors in Minnesota tabled murder-for-hire charges against Qubilah in return for her agreement to complete a two-year psychiatric and drug dependency program and to stop contending that the government entrapped her, wrote the Los Angeles Times in 1995.

But, there was further tragedy in her life when her son Malcolm Shabazz, who was named in honor of his famous grandfather, was involved in a fire that resulted in the death of his grandmother Betty Shabazz.

He was aged 12 at the time.

Betty, then aged 61, underwent a series of skin-replacement surgeries as she fought burns over 80 per cent of her body before she succumbed to her severe injuries in 1997.

He was convicted of manslaughter and arson and went to juvenile detention.

Qubilah's son died in Mexico City after an apparent beating in May, 2013.

Attallah Shabazz

Malcolm X’s eldest daughter, Attalah Shabazz, was a schoolgirl in 1965 when she witnessed her father’s death

“I was watching it as it all happened,” she said.

She remembers her father as “one of those persons you wait for all day to share that special something.”

Attalah also previously said: “Malcolm Shabazz is a whole man, not excerpt periods of his life.

“I would never suggest that my father would want the revolutions of today to have to be violent.”

Attallah has received acclaim for her speeches and involvement in the arts.

Now aged 62, the producer, writer, and diplomat has spoken throughout the US, Europe, Africa, Central America, and the Caribbean. She has served as Ambassador-at-Large to Belize since 2002.

Attallah also works with youth in Louisville.

Gamilah Lumumba Shabazz

Gamilah was born in 1964, the year before her dad’s death, writes Heavy.

She helped her sisters create a clothing line using their dad’s image.

Malcolm X’s daughters launched a clothing line, Malcolm X Legacy, which includes sweatshirts, hats, and T-shirts.

They had slogans like “By Any Means Necessary” and “A Man Who Stands for Nothing Will Fall for Anything.”

Ilyasah Shabazz

According to her website, Prof Ilyasah Shabazz promotes higher education for at-risk youth, and interfaith dialogue to build bridges between cultures for young leaders of the world.

She also takes part in international humanitarian delegations.

Ilyasah was a member of the US Delegation that accompanied President Bill Clinton to South Africa to commemorate the election of President Nelson Mandela and the Education & Economic Development initiatives.

She was also a member of the US Interfaith Leadership Delegation to Mali, West Africa with Malaria No More.

Like her sisters, she is proud to continue her dad's legacy while advocating for youth and “women and girl empowerment"".

High profile Ilyasah has continued to speak out about her father's murder, on social media and to the press.

For example on February 21, 2021, she tweeted: ""Despite following his every move an FBI informant called him, 'a man of high moral character who neither smokes nor drinks'.

""He spoke truth to power, and we know that truth is timeless. Rest In Peace, Dad 2/21/1965.""

11 Ilyasah posts regularly about her late dad on social media

Ilyasah Shabazz told reporters that she has always lived with uncertainty around the circumstances of her father’s death.

She joined her sisters at a recent press conference to speak about new evidence – a deathbed letter from a policeman – which they claim shows the NYPD and FBI conspired in his murder.

“Any evidence that provides greater insight into the truth behind that terrible tragedy should be thoroughly investigated,” she said on February 20, 2021.

11 Ilyasah Shabazz also has a new book out about her murdered dad

Malaak Shabazz

Malaak Shabazz, 56, is a human rights activist.

She and her twin sister, Malikah, were born months after her father’s assassination.

""My father wore his religion in his back pocket. He didn’t push that on anyone.

""He was very much a Muslim, but he was also black. [In the United States], that meant something,"" she told France 24 in 2015, when invited to France to speak about her dad's legacy.

She added: ""“Frankly, I don’t think things would be this bad if he was still alive. It was his passion to make sure injustice was heard.""

Malikah Shabazz

Malikah Shabazz is the twin of Malaak - Betty Shabazz gave birth to them months after witnessing her husband's shocking murder in New York.

In 2011, the youngest daughter of slain civil rights leader Malcolm X was accused of fraud and identity theft.

She was charged with stealing $55,000 and the identity of Khaula Bakrof, the widow of her father’s friend and bodyguard - who was with Malcolm X when he was assassinated in Harlem.

After pleading guilty in 2011 to stealing the 70-year-old woman's identity she was sentenced to five years of probation.

She was ordered to pay back the full amount stolen as part of the deal agreed at the Supreme Court in Queens, New York.

Malikah, then aged 46, was also reported at that time of wrangling with her sisters over the estate of their mother, Betty, who died in 1997 in a fire set by one of her grandsons, said Reuters.

In 2017, Malikah Shabazz, then aged 51, of Berlin, New Hampshire, and her daughter Bettih Shabazz, then aged 19, of Stark, New Hampshire, were charged with stealing a rental truck.

Cops also found seven pit bull dogs in what was described by Vermont State Police as inhumane conditions, reported the Associated Press.

11 Malcolm X's daughter was arrested and released on bail in 2017

The truck’s enclosed cargo area contained dogs locked in crates and covered in their own waste, charging documents stated.

One dog had injuries to its face, neck and eyes that required emergency care, the report added.

Now, Hammer's ex-girlfriend - Paige Lorenze - has claimed the actor's own mother warned her that her son was ""demonic"".

Who is Armie Hammer's ex-girlfriend Paige Lorenze?

Paige Lorenze was born on January 26, 1998, in Guilford, Connecticut.

Lorenze, a model, has over 100,000 followers on Instagram, and over 19,000 subscribers on her YouTube channel.

She mostly posts lifestyle content, and has recently increased her social media numbers since she was spotted with Hammer.

The 23-year-old model and Hammer were dating four months in 2020.

Hammer has been seen with a few women since announcing his separation from his wife Elizabeth Chambers, whom he was married to for 10 years.

Lorenze is a student at the Parsons School of Design in New York City.

What did Lorenze claim Hammer's mother told her about her son?

Lorenze has come out and claimed that Hammer's own mother, Dru Ann, warned her her son was ""demonic"" and that he had a ""very, very dark side"".

The college student talked about his mother in a clip from her appearance on The Dr Oz Show on Friday, February 19.

Dr Mehmet Oz asked her if Hammer's mom or other ""members of the family heard things about him"".

She responded: “Well, she never specifically said anything to me because I don’t think she wanted to assume.""

Lorenze added: ""But she literally just said things like, ‘he has demonic behaviors, the devil was trying to take him,’ things like that.

""I didn’t grow up extremely religious, so that was a little bit out of touch for me, but I did get a feeling from her like she knew that he had a very, very dark side.”

What did Lorenze allege Hammer wanted to do to her?

Lorenze has previously claimed the disgraced actor wanted to remove her bottom ribs so he could eat them, and that he carved the letter ""A"" into her pubic bone.

In January, she alleged that Hammer was ""100 per cent"" serious about finding a doctor to remove her bottom ribs.

""He was telling me you can remove the bottom ribs so he could smoke them, cook them and eat them. He kept saying, 'You don't need them,'"" she told Star Magazine.

The model said she laughed it off but felt ""anxious and confused"" as a result of his alleged behavior.

She also claimed Hammer carved his initial above her pubic bone in an ""extremely painful"" act and later bragged about it to his friends.

In January 2021, Lorenze claimed the actor kept mannequins in the basement of his family home to learn to tie up women and talked about wanting to strangle his dog, The Sun exclusively reported

She claims he was obsessed with ""meat, bones and veins,"" and wanted her to be proud of the bruises she sustained as a result of rough BDSM sessions.

""He told me that he had mannequins in his basement in his family home that Elizabeth and him were living at to practice rope tying on,"" Paige told The Sun.

""It creeped me out, honestly. It was really strange. I'd never even heard of anything like that before.

""I'm not trying to kink shame at all. But I think that dangerous men [sometimes] use this as like a smoke screen for abusing and hurting women for their own sexual pleasure.

""I am holding him accountable and I think he knows that he's caused a lot of women pain, even if he doesn't want to admit it right now. And there is power in numbers.""

She added: ""I think that this [situation] is terrible, it's so unfair on his children and I think everyone is just so disgusted and shocked.""

In a Vanity Fair expose published in March, she told the magazine that during her relationship with Hammer she felt ""really unsafe and sick to her stomach.""

In January, Hammer was accused of sending disturbing messages about cannibalism, rape fantasies, having ""slaves"" and ""drinking blood"" as a number of women came forward.

Following the allegations, he released a statement: ""I’m not responding to these bulls**t claims but in light of the vicious and spurious online attacks against me, I cannot in good conscience now leave my children for 4 months to shoot a film in the Dominican Republic.""

Paul Flores, a former classmate of Smart's, was arrested in San Pedro, California on Tuesday, along with his father, Ruben Flores, 80, who has been charged as an accessory after murder.

The younger Flores was the last person to see 19-year-old Smart alive, having walked her home from an off-campus frat party back to her dorm at California Polytechnic State University, on Memorial Day weekend in 1996.

Speaking at a news conference at the San Luis Obispo Superior Courthouse on Wednesday, District Attorney Dan Dow claimed for the first time that Paul Flores had sexually assaulted Smart before allegedly murdering her.

Flores has been charged with first degree murder, which includes the consideration of the sex act, Dow said.

He is being held without bail ahead of a scheduled arraignment Thursday.

His father, Ruben Flores, has been charged with accessory after murder and will also will be arraigned Thursday. Ruben Flores is currently being detained in lieu of a $250,000 bond.

Dow said he couldn't specify what evidence had been collected to support the allegation of sexual assault, citing pending legal proceedings.

""We don’t want to jeopardise the fair process moving forward,” Dow said.

“Significant information has come in over the past two years, and in the past month ago. ... We believe there’s a location where Kristin Smart was taken.”

Investigators, who launched a renewed search Tuesday at Ruben Flores' property in nearby Arroyo Grande, believe they know where Smart's body was buried, Dow said.

During that search, which continued into Wednesday, investigators were seen digging beneath a garage on the property.

Dow didn't elaborate on where the alleged sexual assault and murder took place, but said: ""We certainly believe Mr. Flores’ room was a crime scene.”

Weeks after Smart disappeared, cadaver dogs had alerted to Flores' mattress in his dorm room.

The dogs later alerted in the same area of the room, even after the mattress had been taken into evidence, reports from the time say.

Dow said in more recent years Flores frequented bars around his home in the Los Angeles area of San Pedro and may have committed other sexual assaults. He urged the public to come forward with any information.

Wednesday's press conference follows on from a briefing held by San Luis Obispo County Sheriff Ian Parkinson on Tuesday, who said officials were 'close' to recovering Smart's remains.

Like Dow, Parkinson refused to discuss specific items of evidence, but said 193 items of forensic and physical evidence relating to Smart's disappearance had been obtained from two homes linked to the Flores family.

Smart, 19, of Stockton, was last seen May 25, 1996, while returning to her dorm at California Polytechnic State University campus in San Luis Obispo after an off-campus party.

She was found passed out on a lawn outside the party at 2:30am.

Several students stepped in to wake Smart up, though it was Flores who volunteered to walk her home.

He told police shortly after she disappeared that she was ""walking real slow"" and that he had hugged her waist to keep her warm as he escorted her back to her Muir Hall dorm.

According to Flores, he dropped Smart off around a block away from her dorm room, before returning to his room in a separate dorm, Santa Lucia.

But Smart never made it home that night. She was reported missing three days later, and police began their search 24 hours afterwards.

Flores was considered a person of interest in the disappearance from the off-set.

Police spent hours with him every day for more than a week after Smart vanished, retracing his route home from the party with her that night.

At the time he was interviewed by police, Flores had a black eye and scratches on his knees.

He first told police he suffered the black eye during a baseball game days prior. However, investigators tracked down one of his teammates who swore he turned up to the game sporting the shiner.

In his first interview with authorities, Flores said he had watched Kristin walk up the path toward her dormitory before he entered his hall.

Investigators said his roommate, Derrick Tse, who had been away for the weekend, was told by Flores that “he walked the missing person home and then came back to his room.”

Tse also told authorities that Flores joked about killing Smart, allegedly telling him: ""Yes, I killed her and brought her to my mom’s and she is still there.""

Flores, then also 19, initially agreed to take a polygraph test, but when pressed by police he reportedly kept stalling.

In June 1996, investigators with the District Attorney's Office finally picked up Flores and told him it was time to take the test.

Reports from the time say Flores ""turned white"" at the suggestion, and refused to take the test once inside a conference room at the Arroyo Grande police station.

Instead, Flores agreed to an interview, which lasted 90 minutes and was taped.

During that interview, investigators bluffed by telling Flores they knew he'd taken a shower the night of Smart's disappearance before going to bed - contrary to what he'd previously claimed.

Flores reportedly buckled, admitting he'd gone into the communal shower at around 5am, after becoming sick.

He also admitted to lying about how he got his black eye. Instead of baseball, Flores said he actually suffered the shiner after hitting his face on the steering wheel of his truck, as he was trying to repair it.

The reason for lying, Flores told police, was because he didn't want to ""sound stupid"".

Although the footage has never been released publicly, officials familiar with the tape said what was most striking about the interview was Flores' body language.

Under intense questioning, pointing out that Kristin's last known whereabouts were with him, Flores apparently pulled his arms into his t-shirt and lifted his legs up to his chest, as if assuming the fetal position.

While investigators thought the teen was about to confess, instead he called their bluff.

""If you're so smart,"" he told them, ""then tell me where the body is.""

Reacting to the arrests of Flores and his father on Tuesday, Smart's family called the moment ""bittersweet"".

""It is impossible to put into words what this day means for our family; we pray it is the first step to bringing our daughter home,"" the family said in a written statement.

""While Kristin’s loving spirit will always live in our hearts, our life without her hugs, laughs and smiles is a heartache that never abates.""

George Floyd's death in Minneapolis saw global protests against racism and police brutality towards the black community.

Did George Floyd have a criminal history?

George Floyd, 46, was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and grew up in Houston, Texas.

A father of two girls and a son, the six-foot-seven ""gentle giant"" had been a star football and basketball player in high school.

The Houston Chronicle reports that 13 years ago, Floyd was charged with aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon - citing Harris County Court records.

He moved from his hometown to embark on a fresh start in Minneapolis where he worked as a truck driver and bouncer, say family and friends.

What was he jailed for?

In 2009, Floyd served a five-year prison sentence as part of a plea deal on the 2007 charge of aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, reports the Houston Chronicle.

One of his Houston pals, Ronnie Lillard, told the BBC that he became involved in his local ministry, Resurrection Houston, after being freed from jail.

Determined to change himself and help improve his neighbourhood, ""Big Floyd"" - as he was known - ""embraced his own life change [and] he was looking around at his community,"" Lillard added.

Floyd's ex, Roxie Washington, told reporters: ""People mistake him because he was so big that they thought he was always a fighting person, but he was a loving person.""

She said: ""I still have a picture of him waking up and getting his baby.""

What did the Minneapolis police union president say about George Floyd?

Minneapolis police union head Lt Bob Kroll ranted in a letter to cops that they were being made ""scapegoats"" during ongoing ""terrorist movement"" protests against Floyd's brutal death.

He said: ""What is not being told is the violent criminal history of George Floyd. The media will not air this.""

Making no reference to the way in which Floyd was pinned down until he was no longer conscious, Kroll whined about the response of Mayor Jacob Frey, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and other leaders.

Slamming them as ""despicable"", he complained the officials had refused to ""acknowledge the work of MPD,"" reports the Star-Tribune.

Kroll said: ""I commend you for the excellent police work you are doing in keeping your co-workers and others safe during what everyone except us refuses to call a riot.

""You've turned the tide of the largest scale riot that Minneapolis has ever seen.""

Yet the Minneapolis Police Department has faced decades of allegations of brutality and other discrimination against African Americans and other minorities, even within the department itself.

Critics say its culture resists change.

The state of Minnesota has launched a civil rights investigation of the force in hopes of forcing widespread changes following Floyd's death.

The FBI is also investigating whether police wilfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights.

Governor Walz and Minnesota Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero said they want to find ways to address the department’s history of racial discrimination.

The governor said he knew that ""deeply seated issues exist.

“And the reason I know it is we saw the casual nature of the erasing of George Floyd’s life and humanity.""

Why was he stopped by Minneapolis police on May 25?

On May 25, “someone called 911 and reported that a man bought merchandise from Cup Foods... in Minneapolis, Hennepin County, Minnesota with a counterfeit $20 bill”, say prosecutors.

Their court report explains that, once at the scene, officers Thomas Lane and J.A. Kueng were told the customer was sitting in a car nearby.

Floyd was in the vehicle with another man and woman.

One cop “pulled his gun out and pointed it at Floyd’s open window and directed Floyd to show his hands"".

After ordering him to leave the car, the officer “pulled him out of the car” and Floyd “actively resisted” being handcuffed.

Once restrained, however, Floyd was “compliant”.

Asking him if he was “on anything” the officer explained that he was arresting him for “passing counterfeit currency”, the report adds.

But, on the way to the cops' car, Floyd panicked, and said that he suffered from “claustrophobia”.

“Officers Derek Chauvin and Tou Thoa then arrived in a separate squad car.

“While standing outside the car, Mr Floyd began saying and repeating that he could not breathe,” prosecutors say.

He was pulled to the ground, “face down and still handcuffed"".

Two officers held Floyd’s back and legs.

Chauvin then “placed his left knee in the area of Mr Floyd’s head and neck.

“Mr Floyd said, 'I can’t breathe' multiple times and repeatedly said, 'Mama' and 'please'.""

The report says that after officers “checked Mr Floyd’s right wrist for a pulse and couldn’t find one”, he was pinned down to the ground for a further two minutes, until paramedics arrived.

He was pronounced dead that same night at Hennepin County Medical Centre.

What has happened since George Floyd's death?

Minneapolis City Council unanimously voted to pay George Floyd's family a record $27 million to settle a civil lawsuit regarding his death in police custody.

Floyd's family filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city of Minneapolis in July last year, that resulted in the ""largest pre-trial settlement in a civil rights wrongful death case in U.S. history,"" their attorneys said.

The judge, who has held the military’s most senior legal role since October, spoke out when questioned over the poor conviction rate in military tribunals for rapes and sexual assaults.

He said: “It would be quite interesting to look at the conviction rate for, let’s say, university students, who are usually thoroughly decent young people of good character.

“They drink too much; they end up in the wrong bed. It goes to court. What is the conviction rate?

“I would have thought it was about the same as the one we get, because our servicepeople are thoroughly good people, but they drink too much, something goes wrong and they end up in court.”

The 15-year-old said she was used ""like a piece of meat"" by the men in Sheffield after being introduced by a woman who groomed her for that purpose.

But when the victim initially disclosed ""one rape and incidents of sex with adult men as a minor"" to cops in 2011, no crime was recorded by South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Crown Court heard.

When she complained for a second time about being raped in May of the same year, ""that investigation was too short-lived,"" prosecutor Peter Hampton told the court.

The girl's case was only taken seriously when she was interviewed as part of the further investigation in 2016 and 17.

Nine men are now on trial accused of a catalogue of abuse against the victim from September 2010 to March 2011

Jurors were told 19-year-old Amanda Spencer ""effectively and efficiently"" groomed the girl when she was aged 15, after meeting her in the city centre.

Spencer ""knew many members of the Kurdish community"" and introduced her to some of the men, who it is alleged would rape her, said the prosecutor.

He said eight of the defendants were Kurdish.

""She befriended her, offered her love and understanding, then lured her into vulnerable situations and sold her for sex,"" said Mr Hampton.

'LURED FOR SEX'

When the girl did speak to those in authority, she found that no effective action was taken to stop what was happening.

Mr Hampton told the court the victim had been referred to social services at the age of six, and added to the child protection register when she was nine.

Her alcoholic mother died when the girl was 13, and by the age of 15 she reported feeling suicidal and was placed with a foster carer.

""By the time she fell into the clutches of these defendants and others who abused and exploited her she was already broken,” said Mr Hampton.

""Her life descended into chaos. She was drinking heavily and consuming drugs.

""Professionals described her as desperate to be loved and accepted.""

Tony Juone, 61, of Sheffield, Shangar Ibrahimi, 29, of Barnsley, Kamaran Mahmoodi, 39, of Sheffield, and Saman Mohammed, 41, of Sheffield, deny one count of rape.

Cops said the girl's stepfather, 39-year-old Elias dos Santos Silvestre, took the teenager to a wooded area near a motorway at dawn before the rest of the family woke up.

The marks left on the teen's body, which was reportedly found by firefighters, led police to believe the suspect raped the youngster and strangled her to death.

Detectives also found an audio message sent by the suspect to a family member in which he confessed he had ""done something foolish"".

Cops said the suspect, who worked as a bricklayer, has a criminal record for three other sex crimes - two involving minors - and a robbery.

He had been sentenced to 12 years in prison and was on parole when the teenager was killed.

Officers are now hunting Silvestre on suspicion of the brutal murder and rape of Jordana.

Cops found the suspect's abandoned car with his car keys and mobile phone in Montenegro and believe he may have fled by bus.

The youngster lived in a quiet street of about 40 houses with her mum, older brother and younger sister, according to local news site GZH.

Neighbours described Jordana as ""a very calm and dedicated girl"" and said her murder has left the community ""disgusted"".

Yes, she trains regularly, but her super-lean, athletic physique comes relatively easily and, as a result, it wasn’t much of a struggle to get back to normal post-pregnancy.

However, whisper that last bit, because Vogue admits today that her rapid snap-back wasn’t something she felt like celebrating – in fact, it made her extremely conscious of the message she sent out to other women. So much so, she deliberately hid her body away following the birth of her second baby, Gigi, last July.

8 Vogue recognises that the speed with which she regained her pre-baby body would be completely unrealistic for most new mums Credit: Mark Hayman

“There is so much pressure put on women about this and I didn’t want to add to that when actually, instead of worrying about losing the baby weight, we should be worrying about where our pelvic floor is at and how our mental health is doing. All of that is so much more important.

“It’s purely down to my body type that I went back to how I was before without too much effort, and I did find myself trying to hide that for the first few months. I’d always done my tanning stuff [Insta posts promoting her line of self-tan products], but I wanted to wait so as not to annoy people.

“I just didn’t want to make anyone else feel bad by being all, ‘hey, look at me after having a baby,’ because the last thing anyone wants to see is someone who’s lost the weight quicker than you.”

Empathetic and sensitive, it’s an honest admission and shows that Vogue, 35, understands that with influencing comes responsibility. She recognises that the speed with which she regained her pre-baby body would be completely unrealistic for most new mums.

She also points out that she knew she’d be criticised for losing weight too quickly – there is judgement and policing right across the spectrum when it comes to women’s bodies.

“That’s the thing about the internet,” she says. “If you lose the weight fast, everyone assumes you jumped into it and if you don’t then you get people saying: ‘Ooh, she’s still carrying her baby weight’. So you kind of can’t win. People think it makes them feel better if they say something awful about someone else, but I would rather be super-positive and then whatever you put out comes back.

“And when it’s to do with anyone else’s body, the best thing you can do is not pass comment at all.”

The vast majority of Vogue’s social media interactions are positive, she says. She has a “lovely group of people” (all 840,000 of them) following her and it generally feels like a very supportive community. But occasionally she sees a comment that cuts deep.

“Sometimes you see that and of course it gets to me. I am happy, my life is amazing, I have two amazing kids, a great husband [former Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews, 32] and I’m so happy in my life and with what I’m doing, so I pull back and remember that. But some of the stuff that’s written is just so awful.

“And Spencer wouldn’t get nearly as much as me. It’s normally always pointed at women.”

Is she a feminist?

“I’m definitely a feminist. It’s so important as a woman to be a feminist, especially considering everything those before us fought for. It doesn’t mean you’re a man-hater or burning your bra, which is why perhaps some people shy away [from the label]. But as a girl it is so important to know your rights.”

Like so many of us, Vogue was deeply affected by the disappearance and murder of 33-year-old marketing executive Sarah Everard last month.

It happened just a couple of miles away from the south-west London home Vogue shares with Spencer and their two children, Theodore, two and a half, and Gigi, eight months, and so felt too close for comfort.

“I know people go missing all the time, but it’s so frightening when it is so close to you,” she says. “We don’t live very far from there. She was going home. My heart breaks for her family, it’s the worst story you can think of.”

I’m definitely a feminist. It’s so important as a woman to be a feminist, especially considering everything those before us fought for. Vogue Williams

The outpourings since Sarah’s death have opened up a national conversation about male violence and sexual harassment and the risk assessments women have to make every day as they go about their lives.

Vogue says it’s so ingrained as part and parcel of female life that it’s only the events of the last few weeks that have made her realise how limiting these constraints can be.

“It’s normal to be like that, it’s just part of life as a woman. I often wake up really early in the morning and I would love to just go for a run. But during the winter it’s quite dark and I would never in a million years go outside in the dark on my own, even before all of this happened.

“I wouldn’t feel comfortable out on the streets on my own, and I think most women feel the same. It shouldn’t be that way, but I can’t see how it will ever change either. I don’t think it will ever feel 100% safe and that’s really sad.”

Sparky and sharp as a tack, Vogue is always good to talk to. There’s rarely any waffle or spinning off on tangents, she sticks to the question in hand and answers it straight. This business-like approach to life must also work well managing a busy household as a family of four.

8 Vogue was worried about showing off her post-birth body Credit: Instagram

“It’s quite hectic – total mayhem – but it’s also amazing. Gigi is a brilliant little baby, so cute, it’s like she’s just so happy to be alive! And Theodore absolutely loves her so it’s all been going really well.

“I think this time around I’m more relaxed, so it just seems a lot easier I suppose. I put her down and she settles herself, but that’s probably down to the fact we couldn’t pander to her as much as we did Theodore, because we have less time now with two.”

Being born in the middle of the pandemic means Gigi hasn’t had the chance to meet many of her family. Vogue is careful not to moan, but concedes that this lockdown generation of babies and their extended families have really missed out.

“Obviously people are going through way worse than what we are, but it is really upsetting. One of my brothers has never met her and even my mum has only been able to see her once.

""I haven’t been able to get to Ireland because of the quarantine and travel rules so I’ve not been home in over a year. By the time people get to meet her, she’s going to be about a year old, so it’s a big part of her life to miss.

“Everyone has things going on that are upsetting during Covid, and when you put it into perspective with what other people are going through with illness and losing their jobs and their livelihoods, we’re getting off lightly I suppose. They will all meet her soon enough.”

8 Vogue says this third lockdown has been the toughest of all for her Credit: Mark Hayman

She won’t comment on the family’s controversial trip to St Barts in late December when London was in Tier 4 and everyone was instructed to stay at home, although she took to Instagram at the time insisting she’d been there working and hadn’t broken any rules.

Nevertheless, she does say this third lockdown has been the toughest of all for her. Vogue found the uncertainty was triggering the anxiety she’d been able to keep at bay over the last few years and so she turned to therapy to cope.

“I found the first month of this one particularly hard – it was so cold and dark and just not being able to see the end of it was tough. I felt nervous because it was like it was never going to end.

“I don’t have regular therapy, but I did recently go back. My anxiety was pretty bad. I take medication for it sometimes and it’s easier to try and figure things out in your mind if you’ve got someone else who is a professional and who can help you muddle through any stuff. He’s an amazing therapist and I’ll always go back and forth, I think. I’ll always have him in my back pocket.”

She adds: “You wouldn’t notice [my anxiety] for the most part, but out of nowhere it will come on. I’ve become good at managing it and when I find it a little too much I have beta blockers, which really help.

""I try to train every day, eat healthily and stay away from junk food because that’s a real trigger for me. If I’m not organised then I get stressed about the things I have to do so I try to have everything in order so I am less stressed and therefore less anxious. People have different coping mechanisms and, for me, watching what I eat, not drinking too much and training help the most.”

8 This month she launches a new podcast, My Therapist Ghosted Me, with comedian friend Joanne McNally Credit: Mark Hayman

Being able to work “the whole way through” has also helped. Vogue has a weekly Sunday breakfast show on Heart, presents regularly on Channel 4’s Steph’s Packed Lunch and hosts a successful podcast with Spencer, which is in its third series.

This month she launches a new podcast, My Therapist Ghosted Me, with comedian friend Joanne McNally. Each episode is an hour of completely unfiltered conversation between two best mates, and Vogue can’t wait to get it out there.

“I wanted to have a positive, fun podcast that you could imagine as sitting around with your mates and talking about what’s going on during the week. We want everyone to feel like they’re out having drinks with us – it’s literally just a chat so the whole thing rolls.

“Joanne and I have always been in the same friend group since we were 18, but we clicked as really close friends in the last two years. She’s just one of those people that if you’re feeling s**t you can ring her and she will automatically lift your mood.

“If this year has shown me anything, it’s how much I value my friendships. I love being around her, she’s brilliant.”

Given its free-flowing, stream of consciousness, no-holds-barred kind of vibe… should Spencer be worried?

If this year has shown me anything, it’s how much I value my friendships Vogue Williams

“He should be!” laughs Vogue. “But he loves being talked about so it’s all good.”

These days, Spencer works full-time on his Clean Co brand of low-alcohol spirits, and Vogue says he’s enjoying his new role as an entrepreneur after years of reality TV.

“He is loving it. That’s what he spends his nine-to-five doing now and it’s going really well, which is fantastic. I think this is more his vibe [than the celebrity world]. If the right TV project came along, I’m sure he’d do that, but this is his baby. He’s found something he really loves and he’s put so much of his focus and energy into it so it’s lovely to see how well he is doing.”

Spencer gave up alcohol three years ago and has said if he hadn’t, Vogue may well have left him. She plays this down today.

“I don’t necessarily prefer him sober because he wasn’t a messy drunk and he was never mean. But he is a million times more productive this way. He was drinking so regularly that he was never fully focused or motivated.”

They both hope there will be more kids in the future.

In the makeup chair with Vogue What’s your skincare routine? I change my products regularly so my skin doesn’t get used to the same thing. I use a liquid cleanser with a face cloth, then put a serum on and a night cream. I spray on Bare by Vogue Face Tanning Mist twice a week, and always use an SPF30+. What’s your luxury item? L’Occitane Almond Shower Oil – It smells amazing. Who’s your beauty icon? Kate Bosworth is gorgeous and classic. Best beauty bargain? You can get great false lashes in Primark. And I love Carmex for my lips. What’s your top beauty tip? I love an HD brow – it makes such a difference to your face and the way it’s framed. It can make you look younger. Describe your beauty evolution? I’ve had some horrific mishaps with my eyebrows in the past! And I take real care of my skin now as well.

“I wouldn’t say we were done yet. I would love to have more, if we are lucky enough. Spenny is the same, he’s up to five now. Seriously. I’ve told him that no one will invite us anywhere if we have five! But I think definitely four.”

While TV and radio will always be her first loves Vogue has built up a lucrative business as an influencer and collaborator, much of it via Instagram.

She has just launched a collection of pastel-coloured tracksuits with cashmere label Lucy Nagle and has teamed up with Fairy as the face of its new Non-bio Platinum Pods.

“Fairy is such an iconic brand and so when they came to me it was like: ‘Oh my god, I’m going to be a Fairy Mum!’ which was very exciting.

“For me my main base has always been TV and radio but then getting to work with brands I’ve loved for years is the icing on the cake.”

The misconduct allegations began when the stars’ former friend, Sabrina Peterson, claimed the abuse and “more than 100” other alleged victims reached out to Sabrina on social media.

Rapper T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, and his wife, Tameka “Tiny” Harris, denied Sabrina’s allegations last month after she accused the artist of putting a gun to her head.

The Sun revealed earlier on Friday that a group of women with claims against the couple will travel to New York next week to meet an attorney building a class action against the stars.

Amid the allegations, production on T.I. and Tiny: Friends and Family Hustle has been halted.

Filming for the fourth season of the VH1 reality series began in december.

An MTV Entertainment spokesperson said, according to Rolling Stone: “We are aware of the allegations, and while they are not connected to our show, we have reached out to T.I. and Tameka Harris, as well as local and state officials.

“Given the serious nature of the allegations, we have decided to suspend production in order to gather more information.”

Last week, aa spokesperson for T.I. and Tiny profusely denied the claims from Peterson.

The rep told Complex: ""Mr. and Mrs. Harris want to be on record and more importantly want the public to know they emphatically deny in the strongest way possible the egregiously appalling allegations being made against them by Sabrina Peterson.

""The Harrises have had difficulty with this woman for well over a decade. They are taking this matter very seriously.""

After making her own allegations against the duo, Peterson claimed more than 100 women contacted her with their own sexual misconduct accusations toward the couple.

She shared a few of those claims on her account, with some of them saying they'd been drugged, forced into sex, and/or trafficked by the Harrises.

Peterson told The Sun she was ""overwhelmed” with the response she has had since alleging T.I. threatened her with a gun in 2009 last week.

In the aftermath of the trial several GoFundMe pages were set up to help those who stood up in court to convict ex-cop Derek Chauvin, reports Mail Online.

One of the first witnesses to testify was Donald Winn Williams.

He told jurors how he stopped for a drink after returning from a fishing trip with his son when he witnessed 46-year-old Floyd's death beneath the former Minneapolis police officer's knee.

The MMA fighter described Chauvin’s ""blood"" or ""kill"" choke and recalled how the officer looked him straight in the eye and carried on.

He then said he watched Floyd ""fade like a fish in a bag"".

To help overcome the trauma of witnessing the killing and testifying under the spotlight of the court and the world, his cousin Shannon Davis set a GoFundme page to help him ""get his life back on track"".

The Official Trauma Healing Fund for Donald Williams II features a picture of Williams sporting the Northside Boxing Club hoodie he was wearing on March 25, 2020 and a courtroom sketch of him weeping during his testimony.

He is an amazing father, son, brother, and cousin... he has been dramatically changed by this incident Donald Williams' cousin

A note written by his cousin pleads: ""Now is the time to help uplift [Donald] and his needs. He is an amazing father, son, brother, and cousin. He has been dramatically changed by this incident.""

Since April 4 he has received $15,447 in donations with the stated target being $500,000.

He has posted a note of thanks ""to everyone for their kind words and generosity"".

He described the fund as, ""a big steppingstone,"" in moving forward with his life.

Another benefactor of public generosity has been Darnella Frazier.

She was the 17-year-old who stopped and filmed events on her cell phone in the now-infamous ""bystander video"" which captured the killing as it unfolded and was viewed across the world.

Tragically, she told the court of her guilt and how she apologized to Floyd every night for not stepping in to stop what was happening.

To help her as she came to terms with her ordeal, ""The OFFICIAL Peace and Healing for Darnella Fund"" up by strangers, Mica Cole Kamenski and Angela Shelby on her behalf has so far raised a staggering $692,820 with a fundraising goal of $1million.

She said: ""We just want to breathe as a family right now. We've been through so much.""

Then there is sixty-one-year-old Charles McMillians who was nicknamed ""the Mayor"" of the community by prosecutor Jerry Blackwell.

During the trial, he broke down and wept in the witness box as he recalled the events of May 25 last year.

In various video footage from that day, McMillians can be heard and seen urging Floyd to just get in the car.

He told the court he wanted to ""make it go easier"" for Floyd, so he tried to counsel Floyd but events began sliding towards a desperate outcome.

Court records filed Friday claims Pornhub’s parent company MindGeek profited from the videos while doing nothing to verify the ages or consent of those depicted.

The suit, which was filed in the Northern District of Alabama, centres on two victims, one woman who lives in the Southern state and another who now lives in California.

The suit claims in 2018 when ‘Jane Doe 1’ was just 16-years-old, she was drugged and raped by a man in Tuscaloosa, who filmed the attack and uploaded the footage to Modelhub, a subsidiary of MindGeek for “amateur” pornographers.

The complaint states: “MindGeek reviewed, categorized, tagged, and disseminated the images and videos depicting the rape and sexual exploitation of sixteen year old Jane Doe #1. One of the videos of Jane Doe #1 had been viewed over 2,400 times since MindGeek added it to its websites in early 2018.”

“At no time did MindGeek or PornHub attempt to verify Jane Doe #1’s identity, age, inquire about her status as a victim of trafficking, or otherwise protect or warn against her traffickers before or while the video of her being drugged and raped was sold, downloaded, viewed and otherwise advertised on PornHub.

The complaint also stated the video’s title included the word “lil” signifying it depicted a youngster.

According to the suit, Jane Doe 2 was 14 when she began being trafficked and was forced to appear in videos of adults raping her which were later uploaded to MindGeek’s websites, including Pornhub and Redtube.

The company never tried to verify Jane Doe 2’s age or consent, according to the suit.

At least four videos depicting the child have been identified, according to the New York Post.

Both survivors continued to be traumatized daily knowing their sexual abuse imagery is online and “permanent,” according to the records.

More than a dozen attorneys from various law firms – including the National Center on Sexual Exploitation – brought the suit which alleges MindGeek is ill-equipped to monitor the millions of new videos that are posted on the company’s many porn sites each year.

For Modelhub, amateur pornographers are only required to submit a picture ID saying the subjects are over the age of 18.

“Once a Modelhub account is created videos may be uploaded. If a video posted by an amateur pornographer includes other parties or individuals, MindGeek has no effective process to verify age,” the suit alleges.

“Essentially, ‘moderators’ hired by MindGeek eyeball the performers in the video to see if they look young. If the performer is a child under the age of 12, it may be more likely that a moderator would flag that video or image,” the suit states.

“However, if the performer is 15, 16, 17, the moderator may be less likely, and less inclined, to flag that video or image due to the ineffective system PornHub implemented.”

The suit contends the system used by MindGeeks to monitor content is woeful at best.

The company is said to have an “offshore moderation team” of around 10 people who are required to remove videos depicting child porn and other inappropriate content, the suit claims.

However, with sheer volume of content, it is impossible to view every video properly, the plaintiffs say.

3 The suit was filed in the Northern District of Alabama Credit: Getty Images

“The ten individuals on the ‘moderation team’ were each tasked by MindGeek to review approximately 800-900 pornographic videos per 8-hour shift, or about 100 videos per hour,” the suit alleges.

“According to PornHub, there are approximately 18,000 videos uploaded daily, with an average length of approximately 11 minutes per video. Hence, each moderator is tasked with reviewing approximately 1,100 minutes of video each hour. This is an impossible task, and MindGeek knows that.”

The suit also claims MindGeek “incentivizes” employees not to remove content due to its yearly bonus system which is based on the number of videos moderators approve.

“This results in individuals fast-forwarding to the end of videos (or not reviewing them at all) and approving them, even if they depict sexual trafficking of children,” the complaint states.

The primary way inappropriate content is spotted and flagged is through users of the websites, the suit says.

Pornhub claimed in December 2020 it had removed over 80 per cent of its videos from the site, including nearly nine million overnight.

The popular pornography site stripped its content down to just 2.9 million uploads in its latest crackdown to contain only legally-abiding videos.

The New York Times published allegations on December 4 that the site monetised from child rapes and revenge pornography among other unruly footage.

The report claims that the mother of a 15-year-old girl who went missing from Florida later found her daughter on Pornhub in 58 different sex videos.

The flagged content then needs to be removed by a team leader, a process that takes months, the suit says.

“There is an approximate backlog of five months between the time a video is reported by a user as ‘inappropriate’ and the time it is reviewed by a ‘team leader’ to determine whether it should be removed,” the complaint shows.

“Thus, for five months, such videos would sit on MindGeek’s sites, available for downloading and redistribution.”

Well-wishers donated £30,000 in just 24 hours after the verdict on the 19-year-old.

The GoFundMe boost came as the island’s government told Britain to “back off” over claims the UK was meddling in Cyprus’s affairs.

The girl, who we are not naming, vowed to fight to clear her name as she posed for an exclusive picture with her mum.

She said: “The generosity of complete strangers who have donated is overwhelming. I can’t thank them enough.

""We will continue to fight this even if it means going to the European Court of Human Rights.”

The girl, from Derbyshire, had claimed 12 Israelis aged 15 to 19 attacked her in Ayia Napa.

She retracted her statement under questioning. Police said she concocted the claim after learning video of her having consensual sex was posted online.

The twisted alcoholic, 36, had previously forced his wife, 30, to be raped in lieu of payment after racking up debts in India, allege police.

Her horrific ordeal was made public in Bhagalpur, with the Times of India reporting that on October 28 she was allegedly sexually assaulted by his pervert pals after he “lost her in a gambling bet”.

On Saturday, the woman’s husband lost yet another bout, and allegedly threw acid on her when she refused to be gang-raped yet again.

Fleeing their home in terror, she sought refuge at her parent’s home in a nearby village.

Local social activist Deepak Singh, who heard of her plight, took the alleged victim to the police station.

Cops from Mojahidpur police station arrested her husband late Sunday night.

Muzahidpur police official Rajesh Kumar Jha told the Independent that the couple had been married for about ten years.

He added: “Her husband was into gambling and he lost her in a bet in late October.

""After that, he would send her to the gamblers against her wishes, where the men would rape her.

“If she ever resisted the sexual exploitation, her husband would beat her and hold her hostage.”

10 He's been remanded in custody, with cops saying a trial should take place shortly

And when she recently rejected his demand to be gang-raped again by his pervert gambler mates, her husband became angry and tossed acid on her, the cop alleged.

He's since been arrested and charged with acid attack, gang rape, domestic violence and wrongful confinement.

The Times of India reports that the man allegedly ""physically tortured"" his wife as she struggled to become pregnant because of his booze addiction.

The man remains in custody. Neither he nor his wife have been publicly identified, in line with victim protection laws.

Police superintendent Ashish Bharti said that following a medical examination of the alleged victim, the case will go before court against her husband, and the accused rapists.

The wife's horrific experience adds to the spiralling number of assaults against females in India.

One female reported a rape every 15 minutes in India, shocking stats show.

The National Crime Records Bureau said there were 88 rape cases every day in 2019, with about 11 per cent of the victims from those in the lowest and poorest rank of society

The National Family Health Survey, conducted in 2015-16, revealed that 33 per cent of married women aged from 15-49 age experienced physical, sexual, or emotional spousal violence.

But, of these victims, only 14 per cent sought help and 77 per cent never spoke about it.

This year, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, a nationwide WhatsApp number was launched by the National Commission of Women to provide an alternate method for women to report domestic abuse.

In September, a woman from the lowest rung of India’s caste system died weeks after authorities said she was raped by a group of men.

She was left paralysed after four rapists assaulted her near her home in the city of Hathras, 60 miles south of Delhi.

Her tragic passing triggered protests in New Delhi with hundreds gathering at the hospital where her body lay.

Her case was the latest in a string of gruesome crimes against women in India that have given it the dismal reputation of being one of the worst places in the world to be female.

“There is next to no protection for women.

""Criminals are openly committing crimes,” Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, a leader of the opposition Congress party, said on Twitter.

Last December, a 23-year-old Dalit woman died after being set ablaze by a gang of men as she made her way to a court in Uttar Pradesh to press rape charges.

But horrifyingly a few weeks later, in March 2019, she says he followed her to a remote part of the Malawi plantation where he threw her to the ground and raped her.

7 Women on the Lejuri tea estates claim they are sexually assaulted by supervisors Credit: Alamy

The anguished cries of the mum-of-two went unheard by her fellow workers, who were too far away to help.

Tragically this alleged attack - which left her pregnant and infected with HIV - was one of many reported on the Lejuri Estates, which supplies UK brands including PG Tips and Yorkshire Tea.

PGI, the British owners of the Malawi estates, are now facing a law suit over the alleged sexual abuse of workers by a number of supervisors, who are accused of 31 different claims of sexual assault and harassment including ten cases of rape.

Marks & Spencer, Tesco, Co-op and Sainsbury’s have stopped using Lujeri to supply their own brand teas while the alleged abuses are investigated and Waitrose is seeking assurances from the company that immediate action is being taken.

But the horrific claims are just a tiny snapshot of the wider abuse behind Brits’ favourite drink - with unsanitary housing, human rights abuses and children being paid as little as 20p a day for hours of back-breaking work in terrible conditions.

Brits drink 165 million cups of tea a day, and the big six – PG Tips, Twinings, Tetley, Yorkshire, Typhoo, and Clipper – comprise about 70 per cent of the UK market with annual sales of around £500 million.

But the shocking truth behind our daily cuppa leaves a bitter taste.

Raped by managers and sacked for refusing sex

Tea pickers on the 8,000 acre Lejuri Estates, in Southern Malawi, are mostly female and are paid just £1 a day.

They are easy prey to the male supervisors - known as capitaos - with a 2016 Oxfam report claiming sexual exploitation was rife on Malawian plantations, saying “harsh treatment and harassment” was endemic.

The Lejuri workers bringing the lawsuit against PGI claim their wages were docked and contracts were not renewed after managers’ sexual advances were refused, with 18 saying they lost income as a direct result.

The capitaos, they claim, would mark them down as absent or having not reached targets, and any time taken off after an attack went unpaid. Six, including Grace, lost their job as a direct result of abuse.

The law suit, which names 36 alleged perpetrators highlights “a systemic problem of male workers at plantations abusing their positions of power” to rape, sexually assault, harass and coerce women they supervise into sex.

When Grace told her abuser she was pregnant with his child, “he just laughed”.

But the single mother, with two young children, lost her job at five months and tragically gave birth to a stillborn baby in December 2019.

Grace said: “People enjoying drinking tea in the UK should know that women working in the fields suffer.”

Tea giants respond to allegations Grant Bramsen, managing director of Lujeri Teas Estates said: “The entire management team at Lujeri has been deeply troubled by these allegations. Following the Oxfam report in 2016, we implemented processes that we judged would address the risks of abuse. Clearly, they did not go far enough. Our absolute priority is to ensure we implement Impactt’s recommendations to the letter and that the potential for any form of abuse is stamped out.” PGI said: “We have been shocked and deeply dismayed by details of the allegations made against Lujeri Tea Estates, relating to the conduct of certain male supervisors … Since learning of these allegations, we have been kept fully informed of the investigation, review and actions that the management team at Lujeri immediately undertook.” Unilever, which lists Lujeri as a supplier and has several tea brands including PG Tips and Lipton, said: “Any abuse of workers is unacceptable and we believe that the correct approach to tackling such deep-seated problems is for us to continue to work with industry groups and partners to help the Malawi tea industry improve the lives of tea workers and bring an end to sexual and gender based violence.” Tetley has suspended supply until further investigations were complete. Simon Hotchkin, head of sustainability at Bettys & Taylors of Harrogate, which owns Yorkshire Tea, said: “We’re in close contact with Lujeri to make sure swift action is being taken. What we’ve seen so far is encouraging, but there’s a lot more that needs to be done. If our suppliers aren’t able to improve this situation, we’d stop buying from them."" It’s not a decision we’d take lightly, because it’s hard to overstate the impact of suddenly cutting off some of the world’s poorest workers and smallholders from their source of income.”

Children as young as 10 earn 20p a day

Despite efforts to eliminate child labour, it remains a huge problem on estates across Africa, India and Bangladesh.

Over half of children aged aged 5 to 14 work in agriculture in India and, in Western Uganda, studies have shown that about 40,000 children work as tea pickers earning 30 US cents, or 20p, a day.

Despite efforts by the government to supply universal education, Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) claims 45 per cent of poorer children between five and 17 are forced out of school to work.

Many are orphans or work to supplement the income of a sick parent.

A recent BBC investigation found children as young as ten performing back-breaking work on tea plantations, digging canals and carrying heavy sacks of leaves up steep hills in burning sun.

Sheuly Munda, from Bangladesh, had to leave school and pick tea at 12 alongside her grandmother, Belmoni, after her mum died.

“I wanted to continue my study, but my grandmother said she could not bear my education expenses,"" she says.

""Instead, it would be better for the family if I could earn something.”

Sakhina Munda started plucking leaves on the same estate in Moulvibazar at 14, working eight hours a day to pick a daily target of 25kg.

“My mother has tuberculosis and my father died a few years ago,"" she says. ""I have to work here to feed our family of four.”

Worm-infested food and open toilets

India’s tea industry, the world’s second largest, employs 3.5 million workers and produces 900,000 tons a year.

Tea grown in the subtropical state of Assam, prized for a rich malty flavour, is found in the majority of UK brands and owners of tea estates have a legal duty to provide benefits such as housing, schools and health facilities.

But research, carried out by Brit charity Traidcraft Exchange in 2019, found wages are pitifully low, workers – more than half, women – live in decrepit homes, are malnourished and many have no toilets.

Dad-of-three Rajesh Tirkey has only been able to enrol two of his children at school.

Living in substandard huts, he says they are forced to live on rations which are often ""contaminated"".

“The wheat flour tastes bitter and forms lumps and is infested with germs and worms,” he says.

For another father, Thomas, his biggest concern is the lack of toilets.

He adds that when his kids are struck down with diarrhoea at night, they have to go outside the house.

For workers, there’s often nowhere to go when nature calls on the job.

“There is no toilet anywhere in the place of work… so we have to urinate or defecate in the plantation,” says worker Maloti Karmakar.

She adds: “People collapse from pressure stroke, especially during scorching heat. Patients are taken to the hospital, where treatment takes time and patients at times die.

""Overheated workers have collapsed and died and there’s no doctor to help them.""

Pregnant women in labour have had to walk miles to get to hospital – statistics show a shocking 404 women die for every 100,000 live births in Assam tea estate areas, compared to 10 in the UK.

Unable to afford ‘life-saving’ medication

Sheila Hassan, a tea picker in Assam, slaves away in oppressive heat and bullying supervisors weigh their pickings twice a day.

“If we’re not able to give enough tea leaves, the supervisors yell at us. They keep on saying, ‘we need leaves, we need leaves,” she says.

Paid just £1.50 a day, she was unable to afford the £23 anti-rabies shot she needed when her son was bitten by a dog and was forced to rely on cheaper herbal medicine.

“With these medicines, there’s no guarantee whether he will heal or die,” she tells us.

Another tea plantation worker, Chanda Orang, describes how a child with severe vomiting and diarrhoea ended up dead because he didn’t get treatment in time.

“If you ask for ambulance in the morning, it arrives in the evening,” she says.

Forced into slavery and sexually abused at 14

The grinding poverty of Assam tea families has also left young girls vulnerable to trafficking, with a growing number of teens being trafficked as modern slaves.

Manju Gaur was 14 when a local man told her he could get her a job as a domestic servant in Delhi, on a much higher wage than her tea-picking salary.

""I was easily convinced"" she says. ""We're poor and live in a broken house without a rooftop. I thought I could earn and help my parents, and my sisters, so that we could study.""

But in Delhi, she was put up in a filthy house with other girls her age, where they were beaten if they objected and sexually abused, often after being given spiked drinks.

7 Tea picker Manju Gaur was trafficked at 14 Credit: CNN

Manju pleaded with the men to let her go home.

“[The agent] said that they had already spent a lot of money on me, and that my family had to repay all of it before they could let me go,”she says. “And so, I had to stay.""

Eventually, she was placed with a family and, although not abused, she was never saw a single rupee of the money offered, with her employers saying the cash went straight to the agency.

By the time a neighbour took pity on her, and gave her the rail fare home, her younger sister had also been trafficked by the agency.

With the help of a charity, Manju tracked her down, rescuing her and several other trafficked teenagers.

Indian police say hundreds of girls in tea districts fall victim to traffickers every year and often end up in the sex industry. In some cases, fathers sell their own daughters as a way to escape poverty.

Lifting the lid on “secretive” tea-buying

After Traidcraft's ‘Who picked my tea?’ campaign, in 2018, the ‘Big Six’ agreed to name their suppliers to help lift the lid on the notoriously secretive world of tea-buying.

Information, seen by Sun Online in 2019, confirmed the investigated estates supply some of these major brands.

“We are delighted that the six largest UK tea brands have published the list of tea estates in Assam that they purchase from,” Fiona Gooch, senior policy adviser at Traidcraft Exchange, tells us.

“Putting this information in the public domain can help both workers and the organisations that work with them in Assam in their struggle for better pay and conditions.”

The Ethical Trading Initative (ETI), an alliance which promotes respect for workers’ rights, also welcomed the “long-awaited” move.

But while abuse like that alleged in the Lejuri case continues, and workers still earn as little as £1, our morning cuppa continues to come at a high price.

Flanked by 100 gunmen, he stopped and announced he intended to marry the 17-year-old, the daughter of one of his most trusted henchmen.

A few months later, on her 18th birthday, Emma became the fourth wife of the infamous drug lord, who at 50 was 32 years her senior.

Despite the 'arranged marriage', she has remained loyal to the powerful drug boss throughout his arrest and lengthy trial for a catalogue of crime - including murder and drug trafficking - in 2016.

Now Emma, 31, has been arrested in the US for her alleged involvement in international drug trafficking and plotting her husband's escape from jail.

She faces charges of participating in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and marijuana for importation into the US.

She is also accused of conspiring with others to help El Chapo - real name Guzman Loera - escape from Altiplano prison in Almoloya de Juarez in July 2015.

The Cartel boss - who had been on the run for 14 years before he was finally captured in 2014 - told police: ""I killed two or three thousand. I’m a drug trafficker. I don’t kidnap or steal or extort or anything like that.”

The American-born beauty queen was a fixture at the trial of the century, hearing damning testimony from his mistresses, harrowing evidence he had drugged and raped underage girls and stories of torture and murder.

Some claimed the presence of the of the elegantly turned out Emma, in pencil skirts, stiletto heels and a cloud of perfume, was for the benefit of the judges and jury in the New York courtroom.

But her support – demonstrated by the matching burgundy jackets the couple wore in the New York courtroom – appeared unshakeable.

She told the New York Times: ""I don't know my husband as the person they are trying to show him as but rather I admire him as the human being that I met, and the one that I married.""

An arranged marriage after meeting at 17

The daughter of Ines Coronel Barreras, a medium-ranking lieutenant in the Sinaloa cartel that El Chapo ran, Emma Coronel grew up in the world of drug deals and murder.

20 The stunning American met the drug cartel boss when she was 17

Despite her unflinching loyalty, hers was no fairy tale wedding but what many have called an “arranged marriage” - one which she had little choice but to accept.

In the run up to the pageant, it is reported that El Chapo bribed the judges to let Emma win - for a very good reason.

A Mafia tradition - which dates back to 1958 when Sam Giancana married the then Miss Sinaloa - dictates that mob bosses should marry beauty queens, and Emma was the prize El Chapo wanted for himself.

Born in Santa Clara, California, she grew up in Sierra Madre, Mexico’s biggest drug-producing region.

At 17, she met El Chapo at a dance and a few months later she entered the beauty pageant in her village of Canelas, which she won.

As she celebrated her win, El Chapo, who was surrounded by 100s of henchmen with guns on show, announced he would marry her.

After tying the knot, the newlyweds made an early exit and police, who had wind of the wedding, arrived too late to catch the elusive quarry.

Gun promise to six-month-old baby

For the next few years, Emma moved from place to place with her husband, staying away from the eyes of the law.

In 2011, heavily pregnant with twins, Emma drove to California to ensure her children – Emalí Guadalupe and Maria Joaquína – had US citizenship.

Seizing the chance, the police turned up at the hospital to question her but she refused to give away her husband's whereabouts and they left frustrated.

El Chappo, now 61, was far from the conventional father.

When the twins were six months old, he sent Emma a text saying “Our Kiki (Maria) is fearless. I’m going to give her an AK-47, so she can hang with me.”

The drug lord – who has 19 children by various wives and mistresses – also kept numerous lovers after the couple wed.

The trial heard that El Chapo - said to be worth £10 billion - paid for liposuction for one of his female drug runners, who then became his mistress.

Whether she knew about is many affairs is not known, but she was said to have “cackled” in the public gallery when one his lovers was reduced to tears in the witness box.

Other than that, the stoical wife showed no signs of emotion, smiling and waving at her husband in the dock.

In court, he was delighted to see his loyal wife, greeting her every morning with a wave or blowing her a kiss.

Emma kept a low profile in the early years of the marriage but, after El Chappo’s arrest in 2016, she gave a fiercely defensive interview to the LA Times, refuting allegations he drugged and raped women and girls.

She said: ""He would be incapable of touching a woman with bad intentions, of trying to make her do something she didn't want to do.”

Flaunting her wealth

Around the same time, she took to Twitter to voice her feelings.

On 30 January 2017, as El Chapo was being extradited to the USA, she tweeted in Spanish: ""We both knew that to make us a reality we would have to pay a huge price: distance, time, challenges and sacrifices. It was worth it.""

She has since switched to Instagram, posting bikini selfies and pictures of her glamorous life to 42,000 followers.

Among the posts were pictures of her daughters’ Barbie-themed seventh birthday.

She posed in front of a life-sized Barbie-themed palace that she had constructed for the events and was pictured with her daughters, dressed in identical pink dresses and clutching Louis Vuitton handbags worth £1,700 each.

She has also been seen with a £2000 Prada handbag, one of many designer bags she owns.

A retired Drug Enforcement Administration agent told the New York Post: “The whole story with her is so surreal.

""She goes around and flaunts her wealth and lifestyle in front of everyone’s face.”

Other pictures on her Instagram include a firing range shot, with her shooting a semi-automatic weapon.

There are also numerous images of her in designer clothing, including a floorlength gold evening gown.

As the trial ended, in February 2019, she posted a photo of the courthouse and wrote: ""Everything that was discussed in the trial about Joaquín, good and bad, does not change in any way the way I think about him"".

After her husband was found guilty of 10 federal crimes, they gave each other the thumb up then she smiled, waved and touched her heart in a gesture of affection.

On Instagram she wrote: “God gave me your love, your smile and your kisses so that I never forget what it is to be happy.”

El Chapo was jailed for life plus 30 years and is serving his sentence at the US' most secure prison, ADX Florence in Colorado.

Putting on a show

But the outpouring of love and loyalty from El Chappo’s beautiful wife didn't convinced everyone – with many believing it’s all for show.

“Do these people covering the trial really believe in the beautiful love story between El Chapo and Emma?” says Anabel Hernández, the journalist who first interviewed Emma in 2016.

“Oh come on. She’s a distraction, and that in itself is important to El Chapo and the lawyers”.

Growing up in the heart of gangland Mexico, Emma was schooled in the strict code of conduct that rules the criminal gangs from a young age.

She is used to staying silent and steadfast as loved ones go down for their crimes - her father and older brother Ines were arrested and jailed in 2013 and Emma’s younger brother Edgar was arrested for helping El Chapo escape from his shower at Altiplano jail in 2015, the crime for which she is now in the frame.

Cops launched a frantic investigation for the 33-year-old after she vanished while walking home from Clapham last week - arresting officer Wayne Couzens on Tuesday night on suspicion of kidnap and murder.

🔵 Follow our live blog for the latest developments on the case of missing Sarah Everard

Sarah Everard, 33, vanished as she walked home from Clapham last week

Cop Wayne Couzens, 48, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and kidnap while his wife Elena has been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender

The heartbreaking discovery of human remains were made yesterday near Ashford in Kent.

Officers are working to confirm the identity of the remains and have warned it may take 'significant time'.

Met PC Wayne Couzens was today found collapsed in his cell after suffering serious head wounds.

The 48-year-old was taken to hospital with a police guard mounted at the hospital following the shocking incident at Wandsworth police station, South West London.

In a statement, Sarah's family said: ""Our beautiful daughter Sarah was taken from us and we are appealing for any information that will help to solve this terrible crime.

""Sarah was bright and beautiful - a wonderful daughter and sister. She was kind and thoughtful, caring and dependable. She always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour.

""She was strong and principled and a shining example to us all. We are very proud of her and she brought so much joy to our lives.

""We would like to thank our friends and family for all their support during this awful time and we would especially like to thank Sarah’s friends who are working tirelessly to help.

It comes as...

""We are so grateful to the police and would like to thank them for all they are doing. We are now pleading for additional help from the public.

""Please come forward and speak to the police if you have any information. No piece of information is too insignificant. Thank you.""

The Telegraph today reported that it was CCTV footage from buses that could have led to a development in the case.

Sarah Everard had been spotted by a doorbell camera on the A205 Poynders Road in Clapham as she walked home - which is a busy bus route.

And in a tragic development in the case, Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick last night said human remains had been found in woods — but did not confirm that they belonged to marketing executive Sarah, 33.

It comes after detectives this week arrested Couzens, 48, on suspicion of kidnap and murder.

Cops swooped on Couzens' home in Deal, Kent, on Tuesday night - a week after Sarah disappeared - bundling the diplomatic protection officer into a car.

Cops moved in on married dad-of-two PC Couzens after a car linked to him was allegedly spotted on a motorist’s dashcam near to where Sarah was last seen on the night of Wednesday, March 3.

But police do not believe PC Couzens had ever met Sarah previously.

Sources told The Times that while detectives were searching social media messages, they had so far not found a link between Couzens and Everard.

The source said there was ""so far there is no evidence"" of a link but added: ""You can’t be 100 per cent certain at this stage but so far it is a leading line of inquiry that Sarah didn’t know whoever attacked her.”

Last night Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said she was ""utterly appalled"" that an officer had been arrested over Sarah's disappearance as she confirmed human remains had been found in woodlands in Ashford, Kent.

The site where officers found the remains is 30 miles from the Deal home where Couzens was arrested.

The marksman, whose role involves guarding politicians and protecting events attended by senior royals, is believed to have worked a shift in South London that day.

His Ukraine-born wife Elena, 38, who works as a laboratory manager, has also been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.

A source said last night: “The working hypothesis is that he saw Sarah on the street for the first time and kidnapped her.

“At this stage it is thought the officer used his warrant card to entice Sarah towards his car.

“One theory is that he may have used the Covid lockdown as a pretext to engage with her and then snatched her.”

PC Couzens is attached to the Met’s Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection (PaDP) unit normally based at the Palace of Westminster.

Detectives probing Sarah’s ­suspected murder searched his locker yesterday.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was “shocked and deeply saddened by the developments in the Sarah Everard investigation”, adding “we must work fast to find all the answers to this horrifying crime”.

Home Secretary Priti Patel added: ""I am deeply saddened by the developments in the Sarah Everard investigation. My heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with Sarah, her family and friends at this unbearable time.

""Many women have shared their stories and concerns online since Sarah’s disappearance last week. These are so powerful because each and every woman can relate.

""Every woman should feel safe to walk on our streets without fear of harassment or violence.

""At this deeply sad and tragic time as we think and pray for Sarah and her family, I will continue through my role to do all I can to protect women and girls from violence and harassment.""

Sarah had been walking from a friend's house on Wednesday last week - heading back to her Brixton home.

However, she vanished that night - with police launching a desperate hunt for the 33-year-old.

Following the arrest of the police officer, the Metropolitan Police has made a referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.

Phoebe took the stage to perform twice during last night's episode of SNL, which was hosted by Schitt's Creek star Dan Levy.

While she first performed Kyoto, the singer's most memorable performance of the night was of her song I Know the End.

Phoebe concluded the performance by smashing her guitar to pieces.

The move was met with mixed emotions from fans, as many took to Twitter to bash the singer.

One person wrote: ""Phoebe Bridgers kind of failed at destroying that guitar, I'm sorry, the neck seems to stay on, it probably just needs retuning. She dinged it.""

https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14466280/russias-disturbing-trash-streaming-trend/,2021-03-30 08:47:56+00:00,"Inside horrific ‘death-streaming’ craze where viewers pay to watch torture, humiliation and death live on YouTube","A DARK and sinister new trend has emerged in live streaming as sick YouTubers inflict torture, bury people alive and even kill for cash.

Known as ""trash-streaming"", the disturbing yet lucrative subculture - which is rife in Russia - sees video content creators broadcast their dangerous and sometimes bizarre or chaotic actions live via a webcam or smartphone.

But what sets these apart from the average streamed video is the depraved nature of stunts and the fact warped viewers send donations along with requests for what the vlogger should do next.

It has become so extreme that in recent months a pregnant woman has been killed and a mum-of-three allegedly raped live on camera.

The twisted side of the trend often attracts those who - incentivised to make quick cash - are willing to push the boundaries to stand out, gain more viewers and draw in more money.

Streamers are often seen drinking on camera as they seemingly commit physical and emotional abuse - sometimes forcing people to commit grotesque acts such as eating maggots or fish guts.

And while the participants often assure they are willing volunteers, in some videos they are seen begging their tormenters to stop as they scream for help.

Groups get together and proceed to simply torture and abuse each other on camera - with the vulnerable often exploited as they urge viewers to fork over cash.

YouTubers and other streamers make money by appealing to their fans for donations or ""tips"" through third party money transfer platforms - with some even offering a price list for certain actions to be committed on camera.

CRACKDOWN HOPES

In December, Russian YouTuber Stas Reeflay - real name Stanialav Reshetnikov - allegedly killed his girlfriend during one such stream after locking her on a balcony in freezing temperatures while on live stream.

In another trash-stream, a homeless man was distressingly buried alive while in another woman's head was repeatedly slammed against a table.

And just this month, a vile broadcast reportedly showed a mum-of-three drugged and raped as vloggers trashed her apartment.

While YouTube and Twitch, the two most common platforms used by trash-streamers, do block creators who show such vile content, sometimes livestreams go ahead unrestricted.

And if removed, vloggers are adept at simply moving to back-up channels and fans often upload videos after to YouTube or messaging app Telegram.

Russian legislators are desperately trying to curb the practice and are looking to ban them, and the streamers, altogether.

Russia is even considering forcing live streamers to register as individual entrepreneurs, making them to pay taxes on donations, but also allowing police to track them.

But the lucrative side to the trend also sees others, desperate for cash, allow themselves to part with their dignity for easy money.

For one participant, Valentin Ganichev, it has seen him pelted with eggs, forced to eat maggots and fish guts, doused in alcohol and even buried alive.

In return for food and a roof over his head, homeless Ganichev has tolerated repeated humiliation and unthinkable abuse as vloggers cash in on his suffering.

Often appearing to be intoxicated during broadcasts, Ganichev has been heard crying for help as he is subjected to vile stunts.

But after police investigated on request of distressed viewers, Ganichev reportedly said he was a willing volunteer.

The coronavirus pandemic has only acted as a catalyst for the heinous trend, with the combination of boredom and the need to make cash accelerating the pace of its popularity.

18 Reshetnikov appeared to pepper spray Grigoryeva as she lay screaming on the sofa during a livestream

During the summer lockdown, Aleksandr Timartsev - the YouTuber behind channel Versus Battle - launched reality show Sosed.Tv in a spin-off of the craze.

A group of strangers moved into a house with cameras in every room, with money taken from viewers to do whatever is asked of them and some areas, such as bedrooms, behind paywalls.

The concept never took off, but further thrust the trash-streaming trend into a negative spotlight when a woman reported she was raped while at the house.

Last December, YouTuber Stanialav Reshetnikov was arrested after he was paid a reported $1,000 (£750) by a viewer to inflict abuse on Valentina Grigoryeva, 28, during a live stream from his home near Moscow.

Footage showed him pushing Grigoryeva - who was in the early stages of pregnancy - onto the balcony of his flat wearing only her underwear.

He then told viewers that she was suffering from an intestinal condition and that he had forced her outside “so that she would not stink”.

Reshetnikov was later seen on the livestream bringing her back inside unconscious, saying “Valya, are you alive?”, before telling those watching “Guys.. no pulse.. She’s pale. She is not breathing.”

He continued the chilling broadcast to tens of thousands of followers - even after calling for an ambulance.

The camera was still live when paramedics pronounced Grigoryeva dead, and Reshetnikov was later arrested and charged with grievous bodily harm resulting in death.

YouTube said the original stream did not take place on the site - but numerous versions of the video were reuploaded, some still live for more than week.

Russian law enforcement said Grigoryeva died from appalling head injuries after Reshetnikov reportedly admitted to hitting her on the day of her death.

It was not the first time he had been seen abusing his girlfriend live on camera for kicks, with previous videos showing him pepper-spraying her and smashing plates over her head.

Some, like Grigoryeva, are innocent victims at the hands of those blindly spurred on by financial reward.

HOW YOU CAN GET HELP: Women's Aid has this advice for victims and their families: Always keep your phone nearby.

Get in touch with charities for help, including the Women’s Aid live chat helpline and services such as SupportLine.

If you are in danger, call 999.

Familiarise yourself with the Silent Solution, reporting abuse without speaking down the phone, instead dialing “55”.

Always keep some money on you, including change for a pay phone or bus fare.

If you suspect your partner is about to attack you, try to go to a lower-risk area of the house – for example, where there is a way out and access to a telephone.

Avoid the kitchen and garage, where there are likely to be knives or other weapons. Avoid rooms where you might become trapped, such as the bathroom, or where you might be shut into a cupboard or other small space. If you are a ­victim of domestic abuse, SupportLine is open Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 6pm to 8pm on 01708 765200. The charity’s email support ­service is open weekdays and weekends during the crisis – messageinfo@supportline.org.uk. Women’s Aid provides a live chat service available. from 10am to noon. You can also call the freephone 24-hour ­National Domestic Abuse Helpline on 0808 2000 247.

Meanwhile another trash-streamer, Andrei Yashin, known as Gobsavr online, broadcasts live with his mum Lyudmila from Chelyabinsk for 20,000 rubles (£190) a time.

During one video, he kissed her on the lips, and another time punched her in the face.

The demise of one trash-streamer has already come about.

Andrey Burim, better known as Mellstroy, started off cashing in on the trend by convincing girls on chat roulettes to strip, broadcasting interactions YouTube.

This spiralled into the vlogger, whose YouTube channel boasted more than half a million followers, holding alcohol and allegedly drug fuelled parties at his Moscow apartment, which he streamed.

As thousands watched on Mellstroy would collect donations from viewers to get women naked, get two revellers to fight and even douse someone in urine.

But last October his lewd broadcasts, which often were viewed by up to 1.5million, came to an abrupt end when he was arrested for allegedly beating a 21-year-old model live on air.

Mellstroy repeatedly smashed her head against a table after she made a joke about his body, and he was subsequently banned from YouTube and other streaming platforms.

Despite such horrific accounts and arrests, still the trend goes on.

Just last week we reported how a horror livestream reportedly showed men rape a mum-of-three and trash her apartment as viewers paid them to abuse her.

The victim, 30, was allegedly drugged to fall unconscious before she was sexually attacked at her home in Yaroslavl.

Several men could be seen on the video destroying her flat as they sought donations from watchers for each act of wanton destruction, with the livestream not stopped by YouTube.

The distressing footage of the alleged rape that was allowed to be livestreamed on the platform has been deleted according to reports, but the trashing of the flat remains.

It has led to further public outcry of demands for changes in the law to counter the sinister trend.

Speaking after the death of Grigoryeva, feminist activist Liza Lazerson hit out at YouTube for banning bare breasts but showing scenes of violence and cruelty against women “without problems”.

She said: “The woman dies on air - and the audience sends donations to the killer. This must stop.

“Such videos are calmly broadcast to the whole world, meaning something is broken. Until this is fixed, censorship is necessary.”

Highlighting the state’s limited power to control internet activity, Russia was forced to lift a ban on Telegram last summer after a failed effort to block it.

New laws, however, may soon be established that penalise streams which contain violence or threats to health under Article 282 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.

Punishments may include fines, community services and jail terms ranging from three to six years - with the potential of harsher sentences for murder.

But a question mark hangs over how successful such legislation would be, dependent on how lawmakers define the activity and the potential grey area of victims who consent to participation.

YouTube has previously said ""graphic content"" like many of the trash streams is banned on their platform - and has taken action to terminate accounts of streamers like Reeflay.

However, many of the videos can be still found on the site as fans or ghouls repeatedly reupload the clips to beat the YouTube censors.

TIPS TO KEEP KIDS SAFE ONLINE Here's some measures parents/guardians can take... The Sun previously spoke to online safety expert Claire Stead, who shared her top tips for parents who want to make sure their kids aren't getting access to any dodgy material online.

1. Teach yourself: If you familiarise yourself with popular apps like Instagram and Snapchat then you'll have a better idea of the risks your kids face, and how to prevent them.

Check privacy settings: Major apps and services – like Facebook or your Sky TV box – have ways of restricting access for young people, so check through the settings thoroughly before letting your child onto a device.

Here's everything you need to know about the 68-year-old, who had hoped to make his TV comeback in 2020.

Who is Michael Barrymore?

Michael Ciaran Parker, known by his stage name Michael Barrymore, is a comedian from Bermondsey, London.

Barrymore is a comedian and TV presenter who hosted shows in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.

One of Britain's favourite entertainers, he became a regular on Saturday night TV in the nineties.

The TV star was best known as the presenter of game show Strike It Lucky at the peak of his career.

Barrymore was known for his quips with the contestants and his exuberant personality.

The show ran from 1986 until 1999.

The comedian landed his own sketch show, The Michael Barrymore Show, in 1983, but after just one series he decided to walk out of his contract.

Michael presented BBC game show Get Set Go! in 1983 while also making a number of appearances in multiple Royal Variety Performances, the first one also being in 1983.

The BBC cancelled the game series shortly after its first run, which led Michael to find a new home with TV programme Barrymore from 1991 until 2000.

Michael also helmed Michael Barrymore's Saturday Night Out between 1988 and 1989, making him one of the most popular television personalities in the UK.

To date, he has also worked on shows including Kids Say The Funniest Things, Animals Do the Funniest Things and My Kind Of People.

He also took part in Celebrity Big Brother in 2006, where he was runner up to Chantelle Houghton.



Where is Michael Barrymore now?

Michael was due to make his TV comeback in 2020 by taking part in popular series Dancing On Ice.

On December 18, 2019, it was revealed that Michael was forced to pull out due to a broken hand.

The injury happened when he fell in training, shattering a bone in his hand.

A source said: ""It's a real shame for Michael as he was hoping this would be his big comeback, but after his injury there is no way he could continue.""

The funnyman was replaced by Radzi Chinyanganya.

What happened to Stuart Lubbock at Michael Barrymore's pool?

The Strike It Lucky frontman was axed by ITV after the tragic death of Stuart Lubbock in the swimming pool of the star's Essex home.

The body of Lubbock, 31, was found face-down in the swimming pool on March 31, 2001.

A post-mortem found he had suffered severe internal injuries that suggested he was sexually assaulted.

Lubbock, a dad-of-two from Harlow, and others had been enjoying an all-night party at the star's then mansion in Roydon, Essex.

Barrymore had invited the meat factory supervisor back to his home for a private party after meeting him at the Millennium Nightclub.

Seven people, including Lubbock, joined Barrymore at his five-bedroom home.

Three witnesses, including Barrymore, claimed Lubbock was found motionless in the swimming pool hours later.

Lubbock's death is still an unsolved murder investigation.

A £20,000 reward was put up for information, ahead of a Channel 4 documentary, Barrymore: The Body In The Pool, which aired on Thursday, February 6, 2020.

The Sun doubled the reward to £40,000 in a bid to ""get to the truth"".

Senior Investigating Officer DCI Stephen Jennings, leading the Essex Police investigation, said he took part in the programme ""to find out the truth about what happened to Stuart and bring someone to justice for his rape and murder"".

What's Michael Barrymore's net worth?

It's not clear what the presenter's net worth is, but NetWorthPost estimated it to be $15million (£11million).

It is reported that he earned up to £2million-per-year from ITV during the peak of his career.

But some other websites claim Barrymore's net worth is ""under review"".

Who was Michael Barrymore's wife Cheryl?

Cheryl Cocklin, known as Cheryl Barrymore, married Michael in 1976.

The pair met two years earlier, during her time in West End theatre shows.

Cheryl and Michael divorced in 1997, after becoming estranged, with Michael coming out as gay in 1995.

After this her health began to deteriorate. In 2003, she suffered a burst ulcer.

On April 1, 2005, Cheryl died aged 55, after being diagnosed with lung cancer six weeks earlier.","['Ellie Cambridge', 'Debbie White']","MICHAEL BARRYMORE was once one of the top entertainers in the UK.

At least 11 women have come forward with allegations against the goth rocker, 52, since Westworld star Wood accused him of ""horrific abuse"" - which he denies.

Wood, now 33, has alleged she was tied up, tortured and raped by Manson after she fell under his spell aged 18.

Last night she added allegations of shocking racist behavior in a series of Instagram posts.

""I was called a 'jew' in a derogatory manner,"" she wrote in one post.

""He would draw swastikas over my bedside table when he was mad at me.

""I heard the 'n' word over and over. Everyone around him was expected to laugh and join in.

""If you did not or (god forbid) called him out, you were singled out and abused more.

""I've never been more scared in my life.""

She added: ""My mother is Jewish and I was raised with the religion.

""Because she converted and wasn't of Jewish descent he would say things like, 'that's better' because I wasn't 'blood Jewish'.""

Wood also shared photos of three of Manson's tattoos that she said are Nazi symbols.

On his right arm is a allegedly a ""Totenkopf"" or ""death head"" skull and crossbones, which was adopted by Hitler's SS concentration camp guards.

His left arm has a windmill shape made of four rectangles which overlap to form a swastika in the middle.

And above his heart is an arrangement of four letter Ms which is allegedly also designed to resemble a swastika.

""He did not have these tattoos when we started dating,"" she said.

She also shared posts from Manson's other alleged victims and news stories documenting the claims.

And she hit back at suggestions the torture she has described was simply ""kinky"" bondage sex between consenting adults.

Wood said: ""Brian and I never had a 'BDSM' relationship'. We didn't even have 'kinky' sex.

""We didn't have sexual intercourse when I was being tortured, before or after.

""I thought I was going to die the whole time.""

Wood, who was with Manson from 2007 to 2010, went public with her allegations on Monday.

She alleged the rocker, real name Brian Warner, had groomed her as a teenager and ""horrifically abused"" her for years.

She has previously told a House committee hearing how an unnamed partner had beaten and raped her as a teenager.

Previous comments by Manson resurfaced in which he spoke of ""fantasizing every day"" of smashing Wood's skull in with a sledgehammer.

And in his autobiography he confessed he once thought he had killed a woman when her faced ""turned purple"" during a bondage stunt.

At least 11 more women have come forward this week with a string of allegations of abuse at Manson's hands.

One accuser, model Ashley Lindsay Morgan, claimed he had asked her to buy Nazi memorabilia for him in Asia and bring it to the US.

Stylist Love Bailey claims he held a gun to her head during a photoshoot.

And singer Phoebe Bridgers said Manson boasted of having a ""rape room"" when she visited his home as a teenager.

She dismissed it at the time as his ""horrible sense of frat boy humor"".

Manson was ditched by his record label and also dropped by his manager of 25 years in the wake of the allegations.

He has called the allegations ""horrible distortions of reality"" and insisted all his relationships were consensual.

On Wednesday night police swarmed on his LA mansion for a welfare check after someone inside was reportedly heard screaming.

He has a way with words, does Boris. Despite being “posh”, he appeals to the masses because, rather than woodenly churning out the “stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives” mantra he cuts through the white noise with relatable aplomb.

“If this virus were a physical assailant — an unexpected and invisible mugger — which I can tell you from personal experience it is, then this is the moment we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor,” he says.

A layman’s terms analogy which explains perfectly that it’s not yet in handcuffs and being hauled in to the back of a police van so, if we relax our lockdown techniques just now, the virus will wrestle free and wreak havoc again.

Understood. But one hopes that the PM has used his convalescence time to study the bigger picture and assess the vital tweaks that need to be made if he’s to keep the British public on side. Harsh lockdown measures made perfect sense in the first couple of weeks when this unprecedented situation took everyone by surprise.

But this is now week six, and there are some damaging mixed messages that need to be addressed if, as last weekend’s increased traffic and crowds proved, people aren’t going to quietly return to normal behaviour.

Where to start? The crowd on London’s Westminster bridge, perhaps, doing the right thing by showing their support during the Thursday night #clapforcarers but unwittingly damaging the social distancing measures imposed on everyone else by not practising it themselves.

“Why am I risking the loss of my business by staying home, when all those people can gather in one place?” asked a baffled friend. Quite. Particularly as he then saw the photographs of customers queuing round the block at the newly re-opened B&Q stores.

'COLLATERAL DAMAGE'

If they and other non-essential stores can trade while maintaining distancing measures, why can’t the thousands of small businesses facing ruin?

Or how about the traveller who flew from Manila in the Philippines — where his temperature was taken three times, his luggage sprayed with disinfectant and his address taken for contact tracing — to Heathrow where he just walked through unchallenged and went home? It defies belief.

Next is the mixed message that we are staying home to protect the NHS from becoming overwhelmed, yet many of the Nightingale hospitals set up around the country are virtually empty, as are the private beds seconded to help out during the crisis.

Meanwhile, cancer patients are having their chemotherapy sessions postponed and vital screening for breast, cervical and bowel cancer has been suspended because “normal” hospitals are struggling to cope with saving the lives of those with Covid.

As top cancer specialist Professor Karl Sikora says: “All of these individuals are collateral damage in the war against coronavirus.”

But surely they don’t have to be if Boris looks at the bigger picture and instructs that all new coronavirus admissions are taken to the Nightingale and other repurposed facilities so that, sooner rather than later, existing hospitals can return to treating serious, non-Covid patients?

The British public is keen and willing to do the right thing, but if we really are “all in this together”, as Boris keeps saying, then he needs to clear up the mixed messages that make it seem like there’s one rule for some, and another for others.

INTERESTING that all the former Dr Who stars appeared on the BBC’s Big Night In except for one – Christopher Eccleston. One of my favourite actors ever, he famously quit the iconic role after just one series.

Christopher reportedly felt the channel – rather than the show itself – handled his exit badly and blacklisted him afterwards, so perhaps that residual acrimony lives on.

Surely lockdown is the perfect climate in which to mend fences because you don’t have to actually be in the same room as potential irritants.

Perhaps, given it’s all for a good cause, Liam singing in his house while Noel plays the guitar in his would be the perfect first step towards an Oasis reunion?

GLEE creator Ryan Murphy is behind new Netflix show Hollywood, which looks at the murky post-War goings-on behind the glitter.

Sounds good. Though anyone in possession of Kenneth Anger’s Holly- wood Babylon books – detailing Fatty Arbuckle’s alleged rape and murder of actress Virginia Rappe or Charlie Chaplin impregnating a 16-year-old – will already be well versed in the movie industry’s less appealing side.

Perhaps, given Harvey Weinstein’s monstrous behaviour, it’s time for a modern-day version?

A CHIEF executive who told a female employee she has “got balls” was not being sexist, an employment tribunal has ruled. We needed a tribunal to tell us this? In the newspaper industry, it’s a compliment (whatever your gender) that leads to promotion.

RUMOURS abound that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has died after botched heart surgery. And that, even if he’s still alive, he’s in a “vegetative state”.

If dead, continuing to run the country may well present a problem. But the latter scenario isn’t necessarily an issue.

After all, someone in a vegetative state is currently running America.

LOCKDOWN CRIME DECREASE IT was a record year for knife crime in 2019, soaring by seven per cent to 125 offences a day. One of the positives of lockdown has been a marked decrease in gang warfare – not least, one suspects, because there are far more police out and about telling sun-bathers etc to move on.

Perhaps, when all this over, they could apply the same tactics to street gangs and make 2020 a record low for knife crime?

He said: “Some times words don’t matter, sometimes it’s the feeling or the impression you get from another person . . . some times something is stronger without saying it.”

In the video, the 62-year-old Riley is seen sat at his desk with his arms crossed and listening to music as an officer explains why he is being arrested.

The carer was jailed at Bristol Crown Court on Thursday for the attempted murder of Ms Skelton in a bid to attempt to cover up the fact that he had stolen more than £100,000 from her.

During the attack, Ms Skelton managed to press her buzzer to alert other care staff, who arrived to find her slumped over the side of her bed.

The incident took place at her home in Westbury-on-Trym in Bristol on March 10, 2018.

Riley, of East Morton in West Yorkshire, provided care for the victim, who had a degenerative physical condition, and he had Power of Attorney over her finances.

Ms Skelton, who was unable to talk due to her condition and used a keyboard to communicate, died in hospital a few months after this incident.

A forensic post-mortem examination was carried out but found no link between the incident and the cause of death.

Investigating officer Det Sgt Craig Basil said: ""Barry Riley claimed he was carrying out a mercy killing because of Ms Skelton's condition and he said she'd asked him to help end her life.

""Following a court hearing, his fabricated story was dismissed by the judge, who ruled that he'd gone to her room that night to kill her, and that his actions were at least partly to hide the fact he'd defrauded her.

""This was a cold and calculating attack on a woman unable to defend herself.

""The depths of his criminality knew no bounds and even on the day of the failed attempt to kill Ann Skelton, Riley went to the cashpoint to withdraw more of her money.

Sgt Basil went on to thank Ms Skelton's family for providing support during the investigation which had clearly been a ""distressing ordeal"".

The 35-year-old was sentenced to six years and two months in jail today after being convicted of having sex with the pupil in a field and sending him sordid topless pictures on Snapchat.

The married mum-of-three will now spend six years and two months behind bars.

Jailing Barber at Aylesbury crown court today, Recorder Dhaliwal said: “It matters not that you are female and the victim male.

""You also sent images, including a topless image of yourself, and a live video in which you were masturbating.

""All of these acts are tantamount to you grooming him and pulling him in, and with significant planning on your part.""

The judge continued: ""There is no doubt in my mind that you acted in gross breach of trust.

""You took advantage of a child in your care and groomed him for your own sexual gratification.

""You already had authority over him by the nature of your position, and to use threats to bring him down so he would comply with your demands to remain quiet, which is what I find that you did, is in my view beyond despicable.""

'DESPICABLE'

The court heard Barber added the teenager on Snapchat at a school football awards ceremony in September 2018 and started messaging him - and ""within a week"" the texts became sexual.

In a victim impact statement read to the court, the pupil said that he didn't do as well in his exams as a result of the ordeal.

It read: ""He was at school and it was through his presence at school that he came into contact with this defendant who was working there in a position of trust.

""He described how he has been caused stress and anxiety having to go through two trials and expressed concern that his family and friends who also were witnesses had suffered.

""He says that his GCSE’s were not as good as they should have been in part as a result of this incident.

“As a result of his poorer than expected results he had to leave the good school he was attending and go to a sixth form college leaving his friends behind.

""His family have since moved to another country hoping for a fresh start, but he had to inform his new school of the retrial.

“The defendant was supposed to help him make good decisions but she helped him make all the wrong decisions.""

As well as the sentence, she is barred from working with children and vulnerable adults and is now subject to a lifelong sexual harm prevention order.

Barber, 35, was convicted of one count of causing/inciting a child to engage in sexual activity after a retrial at Amersham Law Courts in January.

The guilty verdict, which took jurors ten hours and 39 minutes to reach in, related to having sex with the boy in a field.

Barber was cleared of two other counts of causing/inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.

Jurors heard how the teacher began messaging the pupil in 2018 after taking his phone number at a school sports day prize-giving event.

Their texts soon turned ""sexual"" and Barber later picked him up in her 4x4 car before driving to a field.

Barber then had sex with the boy in the secluded area.

The teacher continued to send the boy sordid texts - even while teaching him in class.

One message read: ""You cannot make me blush when I am teaching now, poker face.""

A schoolboy also claimed he saw messages from Barber, asking: ""Do you prefer boobs or bum?”

The disgraced teacher was convicted in January at Amersham Law Courts

The boy also showed a pal a shower selfie showing Barber's face and a picture of the supply teacher bending over a bed.

She also encouraged him to delete messages she had sent although the pupil kept photographs of some of the more explicit texts.

Barber then ""threatened"" to bring the lad down if he reported her and falsely accused him of rape.

At the same time, Barber searched ""what is the name of someone you are having an affair with?"" and the word ""alibi"" on Google.

The mum-of-three also typed in ""a lie of where you have been"" before later looking up ""good secluded areas,"" and ""Holiday Inn, Wycombe.""

During the trial, the court heard Barber kept a secret stash of sexy snaps on her phone in a file called ""for my eyes only"".

Barber was eventually arrested in March last year - four months after the headmaster saw an X-rated picture of her sweeping through the school.

SEX MISS CAGED

Her husband Daniel defended his wife in court - telling jurors their marriage is as ""strong"" as ever.

The delivery driver, who previously referred to his wife as his ""rock"", said he was unaffected by his wife's conviction for sending X-rated pictures.

Barber's ex described her as a ""wonderful girl"" and ""great mother"" who usually follows the line of the law.

But he added he had to call time on their relationship due to her insatiable sex demands, saying: ""When it came to sex, she was just incredibly frisky and that's what got her into all this trouble.""

And he revealed their relationship was dominated by her ""huge sex drive"" with romps up to six times a day - including in unusual places.

The ex, who hasn't been named, said: ""She liked doing it outside, sometimes in the car, the garden or in woods.

""We'd be driving somewhere, and she'd say, 'pull over, I'm feeling horny.' It just got too much for me.

""Everyone has got their personal needs and that sort of stuff got her excited but by the end of it I couldn't be bothered, I'd just had enough. It was too excessive.""

Under current laws, if women are too scared to fight back — or are physically incapable of it — during a sex attack it is not considered rape.

A new bill proposes to merge the crimes of sexual abuse and sexual assault into the same category of crimes qualified as rape.

Rape cases will be decided by the question of consent — strengthening laws in defence of women's rights.

The draft law, which faces months of debate in parliament, seeks to establish specialised courts for dealing with sexual offences and round-the-clock recovery centres for victims.

It would increase jail penalties for work-related sexual harassment to up to two years and make catcalling a criminal offence.

Combating gender violence has been high on Spain's political agenda since its women's rights movement was galvanised by the 2016 ""Wolf Pack"" trial, in which five men — referring to themselves by that name — were jailed for sexual abuse after gang-raping a young woman at the Pamplona bull-running festival.

They were cleared of more serious charges because there was no evidence violence was used.

Mass protests against that conviction, which attracted international attention in the wake of the global #MeToo movement, led to an appeal in 2019 in which the Supreme Court ruled the men had committed rape.

Equaliy Minister Irene Montero, told a news briefing: ""Spain will be a safer country for women with the approval of this law.

""Women's rights and sexual freedoms will never again be stranded down a blind alley.""

The Socialist-led coalition government announced the bill's approval in the run-up to Sunday's International Women's Day, and rallies in Spain this weekend to mark it.

Maria Solanas, director at the Elcano Royal Institute think-tank, said the proposed legislation would make Spain the first country to implement in a single bill all the recommendations of the 2014 Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women.

Moore said two of her former foster children had come to their Columbus, Ohio home to celebrate Moore's birthday when they began arguing with Bryant.

Police body cam during Tuesday's shooting showed Bryant lunge at another woman with a knife outside the home. The department has since urged people to await judgment pending the investigation.

""You're not the guardian of me,"" Bryant apparently told one of the girls, Moore said when recounting the story.

""They argue all the time,"" Moore recalled, ""but I never thought it would escalate like that.""

The foster mom said she got a frantic call from one of her former foster kids, seen on body cam video wearing pink and jumping out of the way as Bryant brandished a knife at her.

""Mom, get home. Where are you? They're going crazy,"" Moore said her former foster child said. ""She said they shot Ma'Kiah and I said, 'Huh?' It was just crazy.""

When Moore got the call, she started praying immediately, just before receiving messages from people saying ""I'm sorry.""

Rajinder Kalia, 65, allegedly groomed worshippers as young as four for three decades at a temple in Bell Green, Coventry.

It is claimed his loyal fans saw him as “all-powerful, all-seeing and all-knowing” after he claimed to have a “direct link to and regularly speak with God”.

Followers were also allegedly indoctrinated to believe he is an “incarnation of God and or the divine”, reports The Times.

The claims were made in a multimillion-pound civil case filed at the High Court last month after West Midlands Police investigated allegations of sexual abuse.

Four women are seeking damages.

HIGH COURT CASE

They have been joined by a man and a woman, who worked as unpaid servants to Kalia, who claim they lost £1.1million which was handed over to him.

Another woman is seeking £520,000 over similar claims, reports the newspaper.

It is claimed he instructed his followers, who came from as far as Glasgow each week, to use threats of violence against people who spoke out.

One complainant alleged her tyres were slashed while another woman was allegedly threatened with acid attacks and had her “family turned against her”.

'GOD ON EARTH'

He is accused of telling them that people “in the outside world are evil and to be avoided”, adding his followers must “only trust him”.

Worshippers were allegedly persuaded that he is a “healer and miracle worker” with fees costing up to £12,000 per person.

It comes after claims of rape were dropped in 2017 following insufficient evidence and Kalia, a former draper and clerk from India, returned to the temple.

But the new High Court claim, brought by solicitor Clare Kirby from Peacock Law, alleges that sexual abuse amounted to “trespass to the person”.

Edward Berger directs the six hour-long episodes which are to begin filming in Europe in early 2022.

The historic story, dating back to 1915, is rewritten by the same writer as blockbuster The Revenant - Mark L. Smith - for a modern audience.

Alfred Hitchcock famously adapted The 39 Steps for film back in 1953.

The 39 Steps has remained popular for over a century and has secured status as both a literary and cinematic classic.

Orson Welles famously exclaimed “Oh my God, what a masterpiece” about the film and even adapted it to his own radio show in 1939.

Through multiple twists and turns the plot follows Canadian Richard Hannay in London, who tries to help a counter-espionage agent.

When the agent is killed, Hannay is accused of his murder and must go on the run to stop a spy ring from stealing top secret information.

5 The 39 Steps is a century old classic so Cumberbatch has to do it justice

He finds himself handcuffed to a blonde woman and they both must work their way out of their mess.

Netflix's interpretation is sure to be a spy epic, but who will play the female lead?

The likes of TV series Showtime and Patrick Melrose have been previous offerings from Cumberbatch and Bergers' collaborations.

Elizabeth, 38, broke her silence for the first time since her estranged husband has been accused of sending alarming sexual messages to his alleged ex's.

On Monday, the mother of Armie’s two children posted a picture of a sunset on the beach to her Instagram.

She reflected in the caption: ""For weeks, I’ve been trying to process everything that has transpired. I am shocked, heartbroken, and devastated.

""Heartbreak aside, I am listening, and will continue to listen and educate myself on these delicate matters. I didn’t realize how much I didn’t know.""

The Texas native - who was married to Armie for a decade from 2010 until their split last year - then said she ""supports any victim of assault or abuse.""

Elizabeth went on to say that she ""urges anyone who has experienced this pain to seek the help she or he needs to heal.""

She concluded her emotional statement: “At this time, I will not be commenting further on this matter.

“My sole focus and attention will continue to be on our children, on my work and on healing during this incredibly difficult time.

""Thank you for all of the love and support, and thank you in advance for your continued kindness, respect, and consideration for our children and me as we find ways to move forward.”

After being introduced to each other by a mutual friend, Elizabeth and Armie married in May 2010.

They share daughter Harper Grace, 6, and son Ford Armand, 4, together.

In July 2020 - months before the shocking allegations would become public - the couple announced on Instagram they had separated.

Mrs Wright was heard ""screaming for her dear life"" before leaping out of the window while her son Andrew, 52, was rescued by firefighters.

She was rushed to hospital on Sunday but died from her injuries. Her son suffered severe burns and is in a stable condition.

It is alleged that a firebomb was pushed through the letterbox of her home in Lapworth Grove - sparking the blaze.

'MUCH-LOVED'

In a tribute to Mrs Wright, her family said in a statement: ""Peggy was a much-loved and respected member of her local community over a period of many years.

""A mother, sister, grandmother and great-grandmother, she was devoted to her family but always had time to show compassion and understanding to others.

""Her loss following the sudden and devastating events of the weekend has left her loved ones and many friends beyond grief, in a state of bewilderment and has created a void in her family that can never be filled.

""The family would like to express sincere thanks and appreciation for the many good wishes and messages of support, but would respectfully request some privacy at this sad and most difficult time.""

Roslin Henry, 89, said Mrs Wright had lived opposite her home for four decades.

She said: “All I can say is she was always a really nice woman to me.

“Both of us used to help each other out. We would meet at the wall for a chat. She just lived with her son, Andrew. He’s in hospital with very bad burns.

“I just can’t understand how this could happen. I just feel so much pain in my heart. She was such a nice woman.”

'FULL OF LIFE'

Another neighbour said: “She didn’t deserve this at all. She was like Peggy from EastEnders - full of life and always there for everyone.""

Mrs Wright, who had breathing difficulties, had lived in Lapworth Grove for more than four decades after moving from London.

Neighbour Liz, 54, said: ""She had a husky voice and you would hear her laugh a mile off. I’ve known her for 40 years - I’m gutted. We’ve all grown up with her. It’s heartbreaking.""

A 46-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder has since been detained under the mental health act.

Cops have described the incident as a ""really tragic case"".

The short horror film premieres on streaming service Alter today and follows two women,one of whom murders men with a snake hidden in her pants, on a road trip.

6 Snake D*** is a new short horror film streaming on Alter

""Snake D*** is one of those ideas that seems exciting at first but then people soon talk you out of it, like you’re crazy,"" filmmaker David Mahmoudieh told Dread Central.

Mahmoudieh was inspired ""to show my support of empowered women"" and began “thinking about ways to represent that metaphorical manifestation of male fear towards female empowerment"".

Set against the backdrop of the 2020 US presidential campaign, Snake D*** follows two women - Jill and Julia - on a Californian road trip.

Poppy Drayton (Charmed, The Shannara Chronicles) plays Jill and Sierra Pond (The Wrong Daughter, Throw Like A Girl) plays Julia in the short film which, serves as an allegory of the political divide created over the past four years.

6 It follows Jill and Julia on a Californian road trip

6 But things get dicey when they run into two rednecks from the opposite side of the political divide

6 The film is an allegory for toxic masculinity and how men feel threatened by female empowerment

They come face to face with two hillbilly rednecks at a remote petrol station and it's this interaction that dominates the narrative of Snake D***.

The men threaten to hurt the women, who they keep referring to as ""b****s.""

Tired of the rednecks threats, Julia pulls out a secret weapon - an ancient wood musical instrument.

6 Jill brings out a secret weapon, an ancient instrument that can summon a murderous snake

As she begins to play it, the camera pans to just under Jill's skirt in anticipation of the murderous snake which will inevitable strike out to kill the hillbillies who look on in fear, not knowing what is about to happen.

“This is only a glimpse into a much broader, stranger world I want to explore. The feature is set against the backdrop of the 2020 election — sort of a ‘How The Election Was Really Won or Lost’ kind of thing — so the outcome of that will certainly influence my ending. Hopefully, it’s the one where you-know-who loses,” Mahmoudieh explained.

YouTube star Jeff Wittek has released a video of himself being swung around on a rope attached to an excavator in a bid to explain his injuries.

Last month the YouTuber shared images of himself with a black eye leaving his followers wondering what happened to him.

The shocking video shows him screaming while he is swung around before hitting his head on the excavator.

He can be seen falling into the ocean as a group of people who were watching quickly run towards him.

Initially the vlogger did not reveal the reason behind his injuries and just said it happened while shooting a vlog.

He said he has had ""a couple of eye surgeries"" but ""wanted to keep that part of my life private"".

He said his eye had looked ""pretty gnarly"" so he didn't want to appear publicly.

Last week the star uploaded a YouTube clip called How I Broke My Face where he explained how his injuries stemmed from falling from an excavator driven by Dobrik.

And yesterday he shared another video called After the accident detailing his injuries and how he is focused on getting better.

""When I woke up in the hospital I was in shock, I was in a lot of pain, ""he said.

""I tore some ligaments in my leg, I broke my foot, I broke my hip, I shattered my skull in nine places, I shattered my eye socket, I almost lost my eye and I almost died.

""The only thing you want to do when you wake up in pain is just heal.""

The video continues by showing him in a hospital bed as his friend exclaims:"" Holy s*** Jeff I thought you were dead.""

Alyssa Broderick, her mother Amanda, and her boyfriend Willie Simmons were identified as the victims of a triple shooting in Austin on Sunday.

Her father Stephen Nicholas Broderick, 41, was named as the suspect and arrested on Monday morning after a police hunt.

Broderick had been hit with child sexual assault charges last year and his wife had reportedly taken out a restraining order against him after his arrest.

The victim was allegedly a family member, court records say.

According to the Austin-American Statesman, Broderick allegedly carried out the murders yesterday just months after a woman had asserted in a sworn affidavit that she and her child feared he would hurt them.

The woman filed for a protective order after Broderick was arrested last June and said she was worried about her own safety and that of her children.

""I'm afraid he will try to hurt me or [the] children, because these allegations have come out and he may lose his career,"" she stated.

""Stephen has prior military experience and is SWAT trained. If he wanted to hurt someone, he would know how.""

The woman was identified by the New York Post as Broderick's estranged wife Amanda.

It added that she also filed for divorce after his arrest.

Court records show that Broderick spent 16 days in jail last summer after being charged with sexually assaulting a child.

According to an arrest affidavit seen by the Austin American-Statesman, the assault happened at a home in the town of Elgin.

The 16-year-old victim told her mother, who took her to an exam, the outlet reported.

Doctors then confirmed the abuse, the affidavit said.

Broderick was released on June 22 after posting $50,000 bail and was ordered not to go within 200ft of the child.

He was also fitted with a GPS tracking device.

The judge allowed the device to be removed in November, however, after Broderick's lawyer argued that he had not violated his condition over 142 days.

State District Judge Karen Sage agreed to remove the device, The Statesman reports, even after the woman said she feared for her family's safety with Broderick out of prison.

She left in place the no-contact and distancing stipulations.

""He had been on GPS for (five) months with no violations,"" Sage told the Statesman on Monday.

""It's a pretty common thing for me to do, frankly.""

Her decision came after a previous allegation from Travis County prosecutors that Broderick had violated the terms of an emergency protective order in the child sexual assault case.

The Statesman reports that Broderick had allegedly emailed the woman involved in the case and accused her of a ""cash grab.""

Prosecutors alleged that he also attached images of her undressed and engaged in sexual acts in the email.

At the time, Sage had increased Broderick's bond to $75,000.

Broderick's bail conditions had also required him to hand over all firearms and not purchase any others.

Police described Sunday's shooting as a ""domestic incident"" as they waited to formally identify the victims.

They said that the victims were ""known to this suspect.""

It took place just before noon in an apartment complex in Austin.

When officers arrived at the scene, ""they located three people who were injured and ultimately have been pronounced deceased.""

""All three are adults, we have two Hispanic females and one Black male,"" Austin Police Department Chief Joseph Chacon said.

He said that a child related to the case is in police custody and safe.

A manhunt was launched as cops warned that Broderick could be ""dangerous.""

He was arrested without incident on Monday after cops allegedly received a 911 call about a man walking along a highway.

Broderick was a former detective with the Travis County Sheriff's Office, according to KEYE TV.

Levi Earnest-Morrison was knifed just yards from his home in Sydenham, South East London, on Saturday night.

3 Levi's mum has paid tribute Credit: Facebook

A 36-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of murdering the teen, who suffered from autism and nerve damage.

Levi's devastated mum Bonnie believes her son's disability, which caused him to walk with a crutch, meant he couldn't run away and made him a ""target"".

She claims Levi was run over by a woman then stabbed to death by a second suspect as he waited for his friends.

Bonnie added: ""He couldn’t go too far hence why he got into a situation.

“We know that my son was disabled and he was like a target.""

'BEAUTIFUL BOY'

The mum says Levi was a ""kind"" boy who helped his neighbours and one day dreamed of building a family a home in the Caribbean.

But she said he was ""conscious"" about his looks due to his alopecia, which meant he didn't often go out.

He also suffered from a foot drop due to nerve damage and attended a local support group.

Paying tribute, she added: ""He was a beautiful boy with a beautiful heart.

“We are very much grieving at the moment. I am in shock, but I have to be strong for my younger ones.

“He was a beautiful person. You can ask anyone from his key worker to his school to the children to my neighbours.

“I am his mother. He was a special case and he was a very special boy.

“He was not a loudmouth boy, he wasn’t a nasty boy. He was very well mannered.

“My son was not in a gang and he didn’t even like drill music. My son was not like that.”

A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family with funeral costs - with 20 per cent of the money raised given to the Lives Not Knives charity.

TRAGIC END

Emergency crews were scrambled to Hazel Grove at around 7.30pm on Saturday.

They discovered Levi suffering from a stab wound and he was declared dead at the scene shortly after.

A post-mortem gave a cause of death as a stab wound leading to catastrophic bleed.

The film touches on William Sotelo’s role in the death of Theobald and how a surprising discovery led to his arrest.

Where is William Sotelo now?

William Sotelo, 32, has been sitting in prison after being convicted of voluntary manslaughter for the death of Crystal Theobald in 2006.

He was sentenced to 22 years for driving the car the night of her death.

Sotelo was initially facing first-degree murder charges but reached a deal with prosecution before the trial began.

What role did William Sotelo have in Crystal Theobald's death?

Sotelo was a member of a California gang who had been shot at by another gang on February 24, 2006.

The gang was seeking to retaliate for the shooting that night and drove up to Theobald’s car thinking it was the rival gang’s vehicle.

Sotelo’s pal Julio Heredia shot Theobald in the head and she died two days later at the hospital.

Her boyfriend was also in the vehicle but he survived.

Neither of them had any ties to a gang, according to police.

Heredia was arrested in 2011 and sentenced to life in prison without parole.

10 other defendants had also pleaded guilty to a slew of charges, from witness intimidation to attempted murder to gun and gang charges

When was William Sotelo arrested?

After the crime, Sotelo was flagged by police as a potential suspect but was not arrested.

Theobald’s mother, Belinda Lane went undercover on MySpace and catfished Sotelo with a fake profile.

She enlisted the help of her niece and created a profile page for a woman named Angel and used Theobald’s pictures to lure Sotelo in.

As Sotelo began falling for Angel, he disclosed more information about him and his life thinking he was building a connection with her.

However, Lane and her niece were just playing detective and trying to gather a case against Sotelo to solve the mystery of her daughter’s death.

Together they discovered which cars the gang members drove and where they lived, and even drove past their houses to take pictures of the vehicles.

Lane ended up revealing her identity on MySpace to Sotelo and he immediately went off the grid.

A Facebook tip given to Lane claimed that Sotelo had fled the US.

He was found in Mexico, living with a wife and four children and was arrested by police in 2016.

Sotelo was sentenced in 2020 for the death of Theobald.

Brave Katie Walsh, now 22, waived her anonymity and spoke out after Lesley Moore, 58, was jailed for nine years.

Katie, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, said: “Lesley told me he was my father figure and he groomed me with cash and presents.

“He bought a puppy because he knew I was an animal-lover and he promised me Justin Bieber tickets.

“He even offered to pay for cosmetic genital surgery because he knew I was unhappy with aspects of my body,"" she continued.

“But all the time, he was buying my silence.""

“When I turned 16, he told me it would no longer be fun and I saw him for what he was: a sick paedophile.”

Katie first met Moore at the age of 13 when her family moved into a house near him.

Katie says: “He seemed like a helpful neighbour and offered to give us a hand. He said he was good with computers and came round to help set ours up.

“Over time, he visited more often. I actually thought he fancied my mum, Linda.”

Katie began confiding in Moore about problems at school, where she was badly bullied.

She says: “Lesley was really easy to talk to. Me and mum argued a lot, as teenagers do, so I relied on him.

“Lesley would tell me I was intelligent and beautiful. He told me he saw himself as my father figure.”

But when she was 14, Moore began touching Katie whilst her mum was out of the room.

It marked the start of two years of sexual abuse, during which Moore showered her with gifts of clothes, make up and Justin Bieber tickets.

Katie said: “In return for the presents, Moore abused me and made me touch him. I had to make sure we had the house to ourselves. He would wait for my mum to go to work.

“He knew mum struggled for money so he bought me expensive treats. I tried to impress the school bullies with the Justin Bieber tickets, although they never actually materialised so it back-fired.

“He even bought a puppy, knowing how much I loved animals, so I’d go round to see him. It was all grooming, but I didn’t realise.""

I was just a child; very confused and scared and the longer it went on, the harder it got to speak out. Katie Walsh

She continued: “Lesley told me he had underworld connections all over the world, and that worried me in case I ever upset him.

“Looking back, I blame myself; I feel I should have known better. But I couldn’t speak out, he totally had me under his control. I was just a child; very confused and scared and the longer it went on, the harder it got to speak out.

“He made me visit his house and perform oral sex on him and I was so disgusted I threw up in the sink.”

Moore also offered to fund a labiaplasty for Katie, after she became unhappy with aspects of her body.

Traumatised, she began self-harming and developed an eating disorder, going from nine to six stones. Her periods stopped and her family became concerned.

Before Katie’s 16th birthday, Moore gave her £800 in cash.

She said: “I had never seen so much money, but my heart just sank. I knew I’d be required to do something in return.

“He told me that I belonged to him. I didn’t know what to do.

“We went out shopping and afterwards, he said to me: ‘This won’t be so much fun when you’re legal.’

“I was filled with anger and I was sickened. I saw him for what he was and realised I had been abused. I felt so dirty and cheap.”

The abuse stopped just before Katie’s 16th birthday.

In return for the presents, Moore abused me and made me touch him. Katie Walsh

Katie joined the army – her dream career – but was medically discharged in March 2018 after suffering depression.

She said: “My superiors realised I had problems and I broke down and confided in them. The police got involved and I received a lot of support.”

Moore was arrested and charged with one count of sexual assault, six counts of sexual activity with a girl under 16, four counts of penetrative sexual activity with a girl under 16, two counts of causing/inciting a girl under 13 to 15 to engage in a penetrative sexual activity and two counts of taking an indecent photograph/pseudo-photograph of a child.

Moore denied the offences and Katie had to give evidence from behind a screen.

Katie says: “He kept speaking over me when I was giving my evidence and it was the first time I'd heard his voice since it all stopped.""

She finished: ""I ended up breaking down and having a panic attack, but I managed it. I stood up to him.”

A jury took just two hours to find Moore guilty on all 15 counts.

In February this year, Moore, 58, was jailed for nine years at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court.

Katie says: ""I am relieved it is all over but for me, the sentence will last forever.

“I have lost the career I loved in the army. I suffer with anxiety and I have dreadful nightmares.

“I can't have people touch my hair because he used to put my hair behind my ears. I can't have people say I'm beautiful because that sets me off.

""He took every bit of weakness I had and he used it against me.

“I will never get back to the girl I was, but I am trying my best to look to the future now.”

He also admitted killing 31-year-old Nichola McGregor, whose body was found in woodland near Leamington Spa in Warwickshire on October 29.

But he denied murder and a further charge of rape.

The 38-year-old was arrested in a stolen car in Staffordshire village Rolleston-on-Dove on October 30 after a five-day manhunt.

Russell, of no fixed address, was remanded into custody ahead of his trial at Warwick Crown Court on August 2.

The family of Ms McGregor, who was known by friends as Nicole, 31, released a statement after the death of the mum-of-three.

They said: “We wish to thank people for their well wishes.

""Nicole will be greatly missed.

""We request to be left alone to grieve at this difficult time.”

Officials have docked payments to 32 survivors in the past year because they were convicted of offences involving drink, drugs or theft.

Some have had their awards more than halved because statutory guidance forces criminal injuries chiefs to reduce compo for those who break the law.

But a furious MP called on ministers to scrap the “unfair” rule which he claims is punishing abuse victims twice.

Campaigners estimate that hundreds of people who were sexually abused as children have had their government-funded payments reduced in the past decade.

Some lost more than £4,000 but in some cases it is claimed the victims had been coerced into committing crimes by grooming gangs who were molesting them.

Others are more prone to act unlawfully - especially with drink or drugs - after being left mentally scarred by their experience, it is argued.

Last year there were at least two cases where victims were in line for a £22,000 payment because of the serious sexual abuse they suffered, according to Ministry of Justice figures.

But in both cases the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board took away £4,400 because by time they lodged their claim they had chalked up a criminal conviction.

'UNFAIR'

Another claimant who was due an £11,000 payout after being left with a permanent sexually transmitted disease saw £1,100 taken off their cheque.

Offences committed by the victims included drink-driving, shoplifting, drug possession and taking a car without consent.

Labour MP Andrew Gwynne, who sits on the Commons home affairs committee, said: “This highlights a real unfairness at the heart of the criminal compensation system and ministers should step in urgently to stop this from happening.

“These people are victims of very serious and disgusting sexual crimes perpetrated against them in childhood and no matter what else has happened in their lives they should get the full compensation to which they’re entitled for these horrific crimes against them.

“Any criminal records they’ve subsequently got themselves are separate matters for the criminal justice system entirely.”

Figures obtained under Freedom of Information laws show at least two cases last year where people who suffered repeated sexual abuse for up to three years had £3,300 trimmed from their £16,500 compensation cheque.

There was also a case where a child sex abuse victim due to receive £3,300 for a sexual assault saw almost half their payout disappear as administrators docked £1,320 from their cheques.

In one of the least severe cases a cheque for £1,000 which should have gone to a child who suffered a relatively minor sexual assault had £100 taken off because of their own criminal record.

In a joint statement, Victim Support, Rape Crisis England and Wales, Barnardo’s and NWG said: “It is outrageous that so many survivors of child sexual abuse are being denied the compensation and recognition that they deserve.

“Victims and survivors are often targeted because they are vulnerable and lack support.

""In many cases, their convictions may be committed as part of the sexual abuse or as a result of it.

The 19-year-old could face a year behind bars after a Cypriot judge found her guilty of making up claims she was raped by 12 young Israelis at a hotel in July last year.

The teen, who has vowed to clear her name, is worried the conviction will block her dream of becoming a police officer and is haunted by tweets naming her online.

Dr Marios Matsakis, 65, a forensic pathologist, claims the lines of inquiry into the case were not properly investigated, the Mirror reports.

He said: “It’s a possibility she had been drugged. It is another aspect which was not fully explored.”

The woman, from Derbyshire, who we are not naming, wanted to be a police officer and had offers from five universities to study criminology and policing.

Her mother told The Times: ""She had in mind to be a police officer but she would not be accepted as she wouldn’t have ‘good faith’ if she had to give evidence in court. ""

She said her daughter was initially named on Twitter and fears she will never be able to escape the ordeal.

She added: “She sees it as a life sentence — it will always be online. She feels powerless, it is like she is being made to go through everything again.”

The teen has faced a traumatic ordeal since first reporting the alleged gang rape.

After telling police of the incident she later retracted her statement under questioning, with cops then claiming she concocted the story after learning video of her having consensual sex was posted online.

The Brit faces up to a year’s jail for public mischief when sentenced tomorrow.

Cypriot doctor Sergios Sergiou treated the woman hours after the alleged sex attack and said he believed her story.

The body of 53-year-old Julia James was discovered in Akholt Wood in hamlet Snowdown on Tuesday. Her Jack Russell was by her side.

Cops have warned women and children living nearby to keep away from the woods as they probe claims tragic Julia was attacked by a stranger on the edge of a field.

And Julia's son Patrick Davis, 23, has taken to Facebook to say a heartbreaking goodbye to his beloved mum.

He wrote: “Mum, I cannot believe I’m even writing this.

""I love you to the moon and back.

""I’m in complete shock and I still don’t even think this is real, but I just hope wherever you may be that you’re happy and comfy because that’s all you deserve.

“You were the most amazing, loving, caring, mother anyone could ever ask for and the circumstances that surround this just don’t make sense.

“I appreciate everyone’s messaging and stuff but I’ve got to ask for people to let me and my family have some space at the moment.

“Fly high mum, I love you so much.”

It was accompanied by photos of them together and a photo of Julia on her wedding day.

12 It's feared the mum-of-two and grandmother-of-one was murdered by someone she didn't know

12 Julia was happily married to husband Paul. Patrick broke the news of her death to the family

Patrick's dad and Julia's ex Wayne Davis said the popular PCSO was the love of his life.

The couple had been separated for years, and Julia was married to husband Paul at the time of her death.

Wayne told The Sun he'd asked Patrick if he knew what was happening in Snowdown after they heard reports of police activity there on Tuesday.

""He said to begin with he didn’t, but there were police everywhere. I said I’d heard a woman has lost her life,"" he said.

“Then a bit later, the phone rang and he said, 'Dad, it’s Mum’. He was crying and crying.

“He was devastated. Julia was the love of my life, but we separated, as couples sometimes do.

“She was a lovely woman. She was walking her dog a lot.

“What she did as a PCSO was not just a job - it was a way of life.""

And he said her death bears eerie similarities to the horrific 1996 Chillenden murders just two-and-a-half miles away.

“What I personally find odd, is it’s happened in the middle of nowhere,"" he said.

“It’s a mystery. The police know more than what they’re saying - they want to catch who has done it.

“For something like that to happen, in the middle of nowhere - you don’t know whether it’s just random.""

Mum and daughter Lin and Megan Russell, as well as dog Lucy, were murdered in Chillenden 1996.

Lin's older daughter Josie, then nine, suffered horrific injuries but survived the attack.

Michael Stone was jailed for the horrifying murders. His earliest chance of release will be in 2023, when he will be 63.

Julia worked for Kent Police's domestic violence unit, where she is said to have been a ""devoted"" advocate for victims.

Cops from the force's serious crime directorate are examining whether her killer was in the area the previous day.

No arrests have been made.

Police have not confirmed reports that Julia suffered head injuries.

One neighbour, who asked to remain anonymous, told The Times: “It’s just too close to home.

""You associate it with what happened in Chillenden. It makes you think, have we got someone going around killing people in the woods?""

Meanwhile, The Sun exclusively reported that a terrified female dog walker was accosted by a man in a van - just a mile from where Julia was murdered.

Locals say two weeks ago a woman walking her dog was approached by a man in a white transit van in Nonington - about a mile from the murder scene - two weeks ago.

He was distracted and the woman managed to flee in panic and called out for help.

Atlanta’s richest neighborhood of Buckhead is determined to take action to ensure residents’ safety as the city has been hit by a surge in crime with murders up 80 percent so far this year.

The Buckhead Exploratory Committee want to break away from the city in the wake of a tsunami of violent crime that has left people “genuinely concerned for their safety”.

In one shocking incident, a woman was thrown to the ground on her driveway and had a gun held to her head before robbers made off with her purse and cellphone.

Home surveillance footage captured another terrifying scene as a man sprinted to reach the safety of his home as a car pulled up with a man brandishing a rifle.

The violence claimed the life of the area's youngest victims back in December when seven-year-old Kennedy Maxie was shot in the head and killed during a Christmas shopping trip with her family.

The Buckhead Exploratory Committee told The Wall Street Journal residents want to create their own police force because they no longer feel protected in their daily lives.

He had no regard for my life Lauren Lenoir

Lauren Lenoir, a 43-year-old restaurant general manager, was left fearing for her life after having a gun pulled on her in a robbery as she returned home from work one evening, reported the WSJ.

“He had no regard for my life. They've stolen something that I cannot get back, and that is my sense of security,” she said.

Another resident, who has lived in the neighborhood since 2002, said several of his neighbors are also considering moving after he was followed home after buying takeout pizza for his family last summer.

Shocking surveillance footage captured the moment he arrived home as a man following him pulls up and takes out a rifle.

The victim is seen running into his home where he calls 911, causing the attacker to flee.

“You kind of are hopeful that this is a near-term trend,” he told the WSJ.

“At first it's just a one-off, but then it keeps happening and you wonder, are we just stupid for staying here?”

The neighborhood is a historically wealthy district and was once ranked the ninth richest zip code in the country with a median price of homes of $1,460,595, according to Forbes.

In the police zone that includes Buckhead, robberies were up 40 per cent from the same period last year and aggravated assaults rose 35 per cent.

The crime spree in Buckhead is part of a wider surge across the city in the last year after around 200 officers left the force following the fatal shooting of black man Rayshard Brooks by a white cop in June.

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms admitted in December she doesn't know how to stop the alarming wave of violence and is “open to suggestions”.

There are now just 1,700 cops serving the force, compared to the possible 2,046 it is authorized to have at one time.

Crime data shows homicides up 80 percent across Atlanta in the period running January 1 to February 20 compared to the same period last year.

Shooting incidents also rose 32 percent, robberies 17 percent and aggravated assaults and auto thefts were both up 47 percent.

“Our residents are genuinely concerned for their safety and the safety of their family members,” said the Buckhead Exploratory Committee.

Former football hero Ian, 57, sobs as he returns to his single-room childhood home in South London for the first time in almost 50 years in a bid to heal the lasting scars which saw him and his mother suffer horrendous violence at the hands of his twisted and cruel stepfather.

Tearfully, he adds, “He grabbed my mum by the neck and she was so small. It just made me feel so helpless. She was trying to say sorry while he had his hand around her throat.

""When I was going to bed I just could not get the memory (out) of how helpless, she was.”

Fifty years on and Ian still frequently has “vivid” flashbacks to the violence that left him “anxious and scared” every day of his childhood.

But it wasn’t his stepdad’s brutality that cut the deepest – Ian’s mum abused him in turn, physically hitting him before cruelly telling him she hated him and wished she’d had him terminated.

New documentary Ian Wright: Home Truths sees married dad-of-eight Ian admit that his can’t stop getting “dragged back to some very negative and horrible feelings” which often ruins family occasions for everyone because he can’t stop worrying his now “perfect and wonderful” life is about to crumble.

In the BBC One documentary he visits his old home, opens up to a psychologist and talks about the abuse with his older brother, Maurice, for the first time since they've grown up, in a bid to finally forgive his mum and move on for the sake of his own kids.

Tragic memories

Returning to Merritt Road in Brockley, South London, for the first time since 1973, Ian is overwhelmed by memories.

He tells the cameras: “We shared a house with another family and me, Maurice, my mum and stepdad, all lived together in one room.”

Ian describes the room’s layout but can’t stop fixating on the wallpaper.

He explains: “There was this orangey wallpaper with funny kind of patterns on it. All I remember is being afraid to turn around, you know, a lot of shouting.

""I mean, a lot of thuddy noise, a lot of grabby stuff going on here. I literally can't see past the wallpaper. Can’t see past it.”

There was mental cruelty too.

Ian’s stepdad knew he liked Match Of The Day but would make him face the wall when it came on.

Ian said: “To listen to the music and hear Match Of The Day is on - it's torture. Just cruel.”

However, it was the abuse meted out by Ian’s own mother that left the deepest scars.

He said: “She regularly beat me but it was the thing she said, that really hurt. It was at this house when my mum told me about termination.

""She didn't just say the word. She said: ‘I wish I had terminated you.’ She said it a few times to me. I knew what it meant.

""When you're hearing that at eight/nine years old that's going to cause you a problem when you get older.”

Sitting against the wall where he used to sleep, he says: “This wall doesn't realise what it's done in my life.

""I'm actually making sure my back's towards it, because there's no love here, that's for sure.”

Ian even fantasised that his real parents would rescue him one day.

He revealed: “When I was young I used to think, Am I with the wrong parents?’

""Because my mum always spoke about how much she disliked me, I genuinely used to think one day someone's going to knock the door and say, ‘Can we have our son back please?’""

Brotherly love

Ian’s elder brother escaped most of his stepfather’s wrath and did what he could to protect his young sibling.

""Despite remaining close they have never talked about the abuse since and for the first time Maurice confirms Ian’s recollection of his stepdad was “giving her a hiding” while he covered his brother’s ears as they tried to sleep.

Maurice is shocked by how much Ian saw, but Ian dreads to think how he would have survived without his big brother.

He tells Maurice: “What you meant to me at that time, I can't even put into words. You did it bro. Love you man.”

Shocking statistics reveal that one in five children will have witnessed domestic abuse by the age of 16.

In the UK last year 1.6 million women were victims of domestic abuse and in 90 per cent of cases a child was present.

Ian meets others who have witnessed and suffered through domestic abuse in their childhood and finds some comfort that he’s not alone.

He says: “I'm totally knocked sideways to find out it's not our fault. You know, we are victims.”

He also makes a big revelation that he still loves his mum and struggles with internal conflict raging within him.

He says: “I absolutely adore and love her. And then there's times when I totally hated her. It's so complex.”

'I am slowly forgiving her'

Finally, a psychologist helps Ian make a breakthrough.

Dr Nuria Gene-Cos, Consultant, psychiatrist and trauma specialist for adults at Maudsley Hospital in London, listens to Ian’s story before telling him “that’s the trauma reaction"".

She adds: ""The worst betrayal in your life is your mother and your parents”.

When Ian describes the words his mother said to him, Dr Nuria defines it as “severe emotional abuse” but tells him he’s not trapped any longer.

When he confesses that the anger inside of him comes from when he was nine and just wanted a hug or “tactile love” she tells him “you can’t let a child run your life” and that he is no longer trapped.

Afterwards, visibly lighter and on the road to forgiveness, Ian says: “That's going to be a massive breakthrough for me.”

Ian’s stepfather left home when he was a teenager but maintains a relationship with his mum who has been “too ill” to take part in his film.

To understand why his mum turned her pain onto him, Ian meets Naomi who admits that she used to hit her own daughter after being a victim of domestic abuse herself.

Listening to her story, Ian’s compassion for her and his mum is evident.

As a father-of-eight, Ian knows he needs to make peace with his mum for the sake of his own family.

Ian says: “There were times when she would just start crying when we were younger and there is obviously some pain in there.

""I'm slowly and surely forgiving her, simply because I have to accept that whatever her journey was, she hasn't been able to deal with that like I've been able to deal with it but now it's getting easier.

“I can forgive, because I have to move on for my own kids. I've got to try and make sure they are OK”.

Ian might be able to forgive his mum now but it’s taken almost half a century and ruined his happiness and, that of others around him.

Wife Nancy tells him honestly that he is impacting Christmases and birthdays saying: “You’ve got to somehow make things not go well because you can’t always be happy. Because you’re used to things not being happy.”

But it’s not just Ian’s kids that he wants to shine a light on domestic abuse for – it’s for the one million kids living with domestic abuse in the UK.

He says: “One million kids, that has to change.

""If I could talk to that 9-year-old me, the one what was scared and lonely, I would say you can get through this, you are strong and you are worth something.

“Abuse creates a vicious cycle and it's up to all of us to stop it.”

In an unusual departure from normal protocol, the Crown Prosecution Service announced the charges instead of police.

Rosemary Ainslie, head of special crime at the CPS, said yesterday: ""Following a referral of evidence by the Metropolitan Police related to the death of Sarah Everard, the CPS has authorised the police to charge Wayne Couzens with murder and kidnapping.

""He will appear at Westminster magistrates' court tomorrow for his first hearing.”

Last night it emerged that Couzens was taken to hospital again for a second time with head injuries.

He went back to St George's Hospital, where he was taken for the first time in the early hours of Thursday morning.

Following the second incident, Couzens was taken back to Wandsworth police station and charged last night with the kidnap and murder of Sarah.

Couzens, attached to the Met’s Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection branch, is alleged to have abducted 33-year-old marketing executive Sarah last Wednesday.

He is thought to have been a late entrant to the police, joining around 10 years ago after previously working at a family garage repairs business in Dover.

She was last seen alive on a doorbell camera at 9.30pm in Clapham, South West London, walking home alone from a friend’s house back to her home in Brixton.

Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave today said his thoughts and prayers were with the family and friends of Sarah after her body was found.

The family of Sarah Everard later paid tribute to their ""bright and beautiful daughter and sister"".

In a statement, Sarah's family said: “Sarah was bright and beautiful - a wonderful daughter and sister.

“She was kind and thoughtful, caring and dependable. She always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour.

“She was strong and principled and a shining example to us all.

“We are very proud of her and she brought so much joy to our lives.”

https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13514706/what-its-like-being-a-female-police-officer/,2020-12-22 12:16:19+00:00,We take down terrorists and fight off sexual assault,"THEY patrol the streets to keep you safe - but female officers in the UK face violence and sexual assaults on a near daily basis.

We recently published pictures of the horrific wounds inflicted on a female officer after a teenage thug attacked her in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leics, in September.

The anonymous officer needed 17 stitches on her nose after the savage attack while cuffing a suspect.

It’s a scene ex-Police officer Alice Vinten, 39, from Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, is only too familiar with after spending 11 years with the Met.

In her memoir On The Line, Alice recounts a warts and all diary of her ten years working for the Met police. She left the service in 2015 but will never forget the action she saw on the thin blue line.

From domestic violence to terror attacks, Alice shares a day in the life of a female copper.

9 Alice Vinten, 39, from Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, retired in 2015 after spending 11 years with the Met.

10am - pinned to the floor by violent suspect

We arrive at a bail hostel - there’s been a report of a disturbance between two men on the top floor.

As another officer checks one suspect, I knock up his neighbour and notice a smear of blood. The unlocked door swings open slowly.

It can be daunting going it alone - sadly underfunding means this can happen often to female officers.

It’s a serious safety concern. Gang initiations can involve calling the police and assaulting a female officer when her guard is down.

Some would never hit a woman but there are many violent people out there that just see the uniform.

Today I’m lucky my colleague is just a room away.

I struggle to see through a haze of cigarette smoke as I walk into the centre of the room.

""Hello?"" I say - and then the door swings shut behind me.

As I turn, a face appears and I recognise it. Mr Dixon* - I’m immediately on alert.

This man has been in and out our custody suite and is known to be violent - specifically against female officers.

9 Alice says many criminals just see a uniform and attack

I rest my hand on my CS spray.

He looks me up and down and revulsion shudders through every part of my body.

A confident smirk cracks across his face and everything I’ve learnt as a copper tells me he wants to hurt me… badly.

He steps towards me and I consider calling for help. But I don’t want to show weakness.

As a female officer you are constantly trying to prove yourself.

I know I can handle myself fine but it still stings when male officers think you aren’t up to the job.

""Take one more step and I’ll gas you,"" I say pointing the canister towards his face.

He backs up and holds his open palms towards me.

I reach for my personal radio and before I know it Dixon has slammed his body against mine.

""I’m not going back inside"" he says.

Sexual assault is a serious threat towards women officers - I’ve had rape threats and sexual comments from suspects in my career. Alice Vinten

He’s now on top of me - pinning my whole body to the floor. He’s going to kill me - or worse.

Sexual assault is a serious threat towards women officers - I’ve had rape threats and sexual comments from suspects in my career.

One colleague of mine was sexually assaulted by a suspect in front of other officers. It was humiliating for her.

That’s in the back of my mind as I try to shout for help but all that comes out is a choked wheeze.

A surge of strength I didn’t know I had rips through me and I shove Dixon upwards.

I push the emergency button on my radio and it immediately lets out a series of high-pitched beeps.

My colleague comes barrelling in through the door and wrestles Dixon’s arms behind his chest to cuff him.

I nick him for one count of assault against his neighbour and one count of assault against police.

In the end, he wasn't tried for these charges - but he was recalled to prison outstanding warrants.

1pm - stop and search with rogue cop

I’m on patrol with the new guy Nick*. He has recently moved boroughs and rumours about his departure are rife.

I try to judge people for myself - but this guy is coming off as lazy, rude and a bit of a fantasist.

While on patrol, we keep our eyes open for the telltale twitch of suspicion. I spot the quick slip of a green hoody being pulled over a face.

Nick is out of the car before I cut the engine. Maybe he’s not so lazy after all.

""Can I ask why you stopped me?"" Green Hood asks Nick, who has ordered him against the wall.

9 On patrol, Alice would look for signs of suspicion Credit: Getty Images - Getty

""No you f*****g can’t,"" Nick barks back.

I’m open-mouthed at Nick’s behaviour and calmly explain to Green Hood that he turned course after spotting a police car.

Nick grabs Green Hood’s wrist. Green Hood ducks down pulling Nick towards him and they fall against the wall.

""You’re under arrest for public order offences,"" Nick announces triumphantly.

He tightens the cuffs and Green Hood screams in pain. He looks over to me smirking and gives a wink.

Does he think he’s in an American cop movie?

Sadly the force can attract bullies and racists - and frustratingly it drags the reputation of good coppers down with them.

Stop and search means we are often accused of being racist - especially towards the black community.

I can sympathise with that frustration. There are old school bobbies who think that if you’ve got nothing to hide you shouldn’t mind being searched.

But being stopped day in and day out for going about your business is just simply not OK.

There needs to be better training, better communication and we need to report and root out racists.

When I get back to the station I vow to never work with this clown again.

3pm - schizophrenic with knife obsession

""Officers to respond to an I graded call in Brinkley Villas*, informant stating she has a knife and is going to kill herself"" crackles out on the radio.

'I grade' means immediate. We reach the address in three minutes.

It’s a familiar call to police - Mrs Mowbray, 54*, an obese schizophrenic with an obsession with knives. Brilliant.

We deal with serious mental health patients on a day to day basis and often groan at doing so.

No one deserves to be dealt with by officers when they are having a breakdown.

Either mental health needs more funding or we need better training in dealing with these scenarios.

We get an update that Mrs Mowbray is now threatening to stab any police officers who try to stop her killing herself.

We rap on the door calling her name - no answer so we step into her hallway and edge downstairs.

Stepping into dark buildings usually spooks me but this visit is something else.

I can hear the creepy tinkle of Jeepers Creepers playing from a radio behind a closed door.

This is how horror films start.

""Who dat?"" Mrs Mowbray shouts from the other side.

We explain and she tells us to go away.

But she’s called us and it’s our duty to make sure she’s ok before we leave. I force the door.

""I wouldn’t do that if I were you,"" she says in a playful sing-song voice.

""I’ve got a mighty big knife in here and if you open that door, I’m going to cut you into teen tiny pieces.""

I shudder but we burst through the door and Mrs Mowbray is sat on a single bed with a pink frilled valance.

Her grey hair is set in rollers and her pink nightdress is pressed and clean. She’s as wide as the bed.

She waves the bluntest, rustiest and oldest machete ever over her head while struggling to sit up.

""I’ll cut you!"" she shouts.

She would have to bash us with the machete for about half an hour to even bruise us.

My partner marches up to her and swiftly grabs the knife.

I step into the hallway and run a damp hand over my sweaty forehead. This so easily could have gone another way.

5pm - suspected terror attack

Control tells us they’ve had multiple calls about a man outside the local station, chanting in Arabic and wearing a wire-laden rucksack.

This is the kind of call you constantly dread.

Three of us arrive at the station - witnesses tell us he’s just headed down the escalators. Other units will arrive in 15 minutes. We’re on our own.

9 A terror alert is the call all police dread, says Alice Credit: Getty Images - Getty

We race down the metal steps and check the platforms. A train whizzes away. We’ve just missed him.

He’s on his way to the next station. We call it in as we head there in our car.

At the scene, we spot him on the station’s concourse.

A thin weedy guy, with a thick beard and a red wire running from his rucksack, over his shoulder and tucked into his collar.

As we slowly approach, he raises his arms - I see the red wire snakes up his arm and into his clenched fist.

This is it. He’s going to press the button.

My partner Trevor* looks calm: ""I don’t think you have a bomb at all, do you?""

The suspect’s shoulders sag and Trevor tugs at the red wire which unfurls with no resistance.

It’s connected to nothing. There is no bomb.

I feel like laughing. I feel like screaming. I want to punch the suspect in the face.

I ask the man to put his arms down - if armed response arrive they will shoot him.

My partner laughs: ""That’s what he wants. Suicide by Police, Coward.""

The suspect turns out to be a schizophrenic drug addict - off his meds.

9pm - jeered at in broken down van

I’m in the driver’s seat of the prisoner van. I love driving the van - it feels great being a woman in charge of a hulking great machine.

Just as I’m feeling incredibly pleased with myself I head on to a roundabout - and stall.

The engine splutters as I try to restart the engine.

We couldn’t have broken down in a worse spot. A pub full of drinkers have spotted me struggling at the wheel and are now jeering.

Luckily they agree to give us a push and we’re off when the motor jumps back into action.

My colleague is in hysterics - I’ll never live this down.

10pm - broken nose and ribs in domestic attack

When you get a call for a domestic my experience tells me you get there as soon as you can.

I’ve seen too many battered women to take domestic violence lightly. I put the blue lights on and grip the wheel.

Rarely a shift goes by without a DV call - and that increases towards Christmas or any boozy holiday.

The radio tells me there’s a history of violence, weapons and mental health issues at this address.

9 Alice - who now works for a domestic abuse charity - told how police get daily call outs for assault in the home Credit: JOHN McLELLAN

We arrive at the scene and the splintered door tells me we - the police - have been here before.

""Police!"" I shout. I hear a door slam and muffled crying.

We run upstairs to the kitchen and one look at the woman tells me we need an ambulance. Fast.

Joanne’s* about forty, her fingernails are torn, her nose broken, one eye is swollen shut and from her breathing I’m guessing she may have fractured ribs.

While my partner hunts down the suspect, I sit with her and ask if he hit her with anything.

""Just his fists as usual"" she tells me.

Just 17 herself, the teenager had been lodging with serial killers Fred and Rose West for 10 months and unwittingly babysat their children while they picked up girls to rape, torture and murder.

But in a new Channel 5 documentary, Rose West: Making a Monster, she reveals it was the vile abuse of their daughter that led to her fleeing the house of horrors.

“Something disturbed me and I couldn’t work out what it was,” she says.

“Then I realised it was in the cellar. I could hear Heather screaming ‘Stop it Daddy’.""

After a few nights Heather asked to speak to Jayne, who had become a trusted ally.

“It was shocking,” she says. “She told me Fred was ‘breaking his young daughter in as all good dads should do.’ Then she told me ‘get out of here while you can’. Thankfully she saved my life.”

Years later, Heather became the last of nine girls murdered by the evil couple between 1973 and 1987 and, like many of the victims, her remains were buried in the garden of the Gloucester home.

The shocking documentary, which airs tonight, examines the abusive childhood of Rose West and argues that her sick upbringing put her on the path to evil.

Rose was convicted of ten counts of murder, in 1992, and is currently serving a life sentence. Fred took his own life before the trial.

Raised by a violent father, who regularly beat his children and raped her from a young age, Rose was just 16 when she met Fred, then 28, on a bus.

Criminologist and author Dr Jane Carter Woodrow says the chance meeting with Fred - who also came from an abusive and incestuous background - was a tragic fluke.

“They both came from toxic households and very violent fathers, had both been sexually abused, and Rose was quite vulnerable,” she told the Sun.

“She had recently moved to the area so it’s unlucky that two people as extreme as that should meet. It was the perfect storm.”

Electric shock in womb 'retarded development'

The fifth of seven children, Rose Letts was given the worst start in life when she was born in North Devon, in 1953.

Mum Daisy, suffering from deep depression during pregnancy, was given Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) - electric shocks applied to the skull.

The treatment induced seizures so severe that patients broke teeth, bit through tongues and even broke bones.

Daisy’s final treatment was just days before Rose was born and criminal psychologist Dr David Holmes believes her neurological development ""will have been retarded.""

“This (stage) is often the most sophisticated part of the brain development - the parts that give us a conscience, that give us empathy - that stop us from doing heinous acts.”

Dad Bill, who was forced to retire from the Navy because of his wife’s illness, had psychotic episodes and constantly beat his children and his wife.

Obsessed with cleanliness, he ran his home like a military bootcamp and made his children scrub the carpet with toothbrushes.

They were not allowed to play with others on the estate, and Daisy would be beaten for chatting to neighbours.

Neighbour Gill Job tells the programme: “You could hear the screams and the banging and shouting. It was awful to hear.""

Raped by violent dad

At school, Rose was put in the corner wearing a dunce’s cap.

But Jane says she found a way to manipulate her father and escape beatings.

“She was nicknamed Dozy Rosie because was behind at school and behind her brothers and sisters,” she says.

“But her ways were quite winsome, and she made her father laugh so he let her off the beatings.

“But Bill began grooming her from a young age. Rosie was the vulnerable one who wasn’t going to say anything when he began to sexually abuse her.”

After puberty hit, Rose began to use violence to get her own way at school, lashing out at smaller children.

“She had always felt out of control but now she had control over others,” says Jane.

“She suddenly felt empowered. She got more and more aggressive and violent.”

Raped by mum at 12 and introduced to sex with sheep

Rose’s sickening childhood was matched by that of Fred, who grew up in rural Herefordshire with seven siblings and a volatile, abusive father.

He later claimed that his mum, Daisy, instigated sex with him at the age of 12.

He also claimed dad, Walter, introduced him to sex with animals, particularly sheep, and that he watched his dad abuse young girls.

When they met at a bus stop in Cheltenham, 16-year-old Rose had recently moved from North Devon to live with her dad, but had already gained a reputation for sleeping with older men.

Fred, 13 years her senior, sat next to her and they soon found they had a lot in common, not least their abusive background. Even when Fred revealed his love of bondage and sadomasochism, Rose wasn’t fazed.

“Any other girl would have run off,” says Jane. “But Rose didn’t, because it was a normal thing to her.”

At the time, Fred was already a killer - having murdered his 18-year-old mistress, Anna McFall, and their unborn baby three years before.

“Rose and Fred were the worst possible combination. Fred was obsessed with sex and death and would have continued to kill, I have no doubt,” says Jane.

“Rose had the potential to be violent but I don't know if she would have become a serial killer if she hadn't met him.""

Children whipped and beaten with rolling pins

Within months, the pair had moved into 25 Cromwell Road, Gloucester with Fred’s stepdaughter Charmaine and daughter Anne Marie.

But two months after the birth of their first child Heather, in 1970, Fred was jailed for petty theft, leaving 17-year-old Rose to look after three children - using the violent rule she learned from her father.

The girls were tied to the bed and whipped. On one occasion, a neighbour came into the house to see Charmaine standing on a chair, naked, with her arms tied with a belt, and Rose attacking her with a rolling pin.

Shortly before Fred's release, in June 1971, Rose murdered Charmaine. Fred later buried her remains under the kitchen floor.

When his first wife Rena Costello began asking questions about her daughter, Fred strangled her and buried her in a nearby field

Prostitution and sick sex tape

The couple went on to have daughters Mae June and Louise, with two sons, Stephen and Barry.

But they were becoming increasingly depraved, with Rose having sex with numerous men in the house, for money, while Fred watched through peepholes indoors and walls.

Fred often taped her sex sessions with clients - which included her own dad - and three more children, Tara, Rosemary Junior and Lucyanna, were fathered by other men.

Fred West’s biographer, Geoffrey Wansell, tells the documentary he is one of the few people who has seen the tapes of Rose performing “extraordinary sexual acts.”

“They’re absolutely revolting,” he says. “She was performing for Fred, inserting things into herself, showing used knickers she kept in jars on the mantelpiece, showing how enthusiastic it was.”

Sick killing spree ends with daughter Heather

At eight, Anne Marie was taken to the cellar, forced to strip by Rose and then raped by her father and she grew up being sexually abused by both her parents. Mae was raped from the age of five.

Rose also forced the boys to watch violent porn, hitting them with a glass ashtray if they turned away.

Not satisfied with abusing their own kids, the couple picked up Caroline Owens, in 1972, drugged her, tied her up and subjected her to a prolonged sexual attack before she escaped.

Incredibly, the pair were convicted of sexual assault and were fined just £50.

Over the next few years, the pair murdered eight more vulnerable girls, often cruising around with babies in the car to offer them a job as a nanny.

Their final victim was daughter Heather, beaten and strangled at 16 in front of brother Barry, and buried under a fresh patio built in the garden.

The monstrous pair would even tell their other children to behave or they’d “end up under the patio like Heather.”

The couple were arrested in 1992 after 13-year-old daughter Louise told police she had been raped by her father.

Police searching the house uncovered he remains of mutilated female bodies in the garden and cellar of their Gloucestershire home.

Tragic victims of Fred and Rose West Anna McFall The nanny of Fred and his first wife Rena West’s children, McFall was believed to have been murdered in 1967. She was pregnant when she died, with West believed to have been the father. Her body was found in June 1994 in a shallow grave. Charmaine West Fred West’s stepdaughter from his previous marriage, murdered at eight by Rose Rena West Rena is believed to have been murdered by strangulation. Rose was not charged for this murder. Lynda Gough Lynda Gough was the first sexually motivated killing conducted by the Wests, after she moved into Cromwell Street in April 1973. Strangulation and suffocation were the likely causes of death. Carol Ann Cooper Cooper was murdered in November 1973, aged just 15. On the night of November 9, she was allowed to spend the night at her grandmother’s house before a doctor’s appointment the next morning. She attended the appointment and then met her boyfriend, before somehow ending up on Cromwell Street. Her body was found more than twenty years later. Lucy Partington A 21-year-old medieval English student at Exeter University, she returned home for Christmas in December 1973. She left a friend’s house in a rush to get the last bus from Cheltenham to Gretton on 27 December, with it believed she was abducted from this bus stop. She was found more twenty years later, her dismembered body in the cellar of Cromwell Street. Therese Siegenthaler A 21-year-old Swiss sociology student at Woolwich Polytechnic. She had planned to hitch-hike to Ireland in Easter 1974. Her family reported her missing having not heard from her for some time. Prosecution believe she was abducted before being killed, with Fred West later building a fake chimney over her grave. Shirley Hubbard Just 15 at the time of her death, Hubbard is believed to have been abducted by the Wests. Her body was found following an excavation in the concrete and plastic membrane of the cellar floor. Juanita Mott In the summer of 1974, Mott moved into 25 Cromwell Street but later went missing when she was living in Newent. Her body was found in March 1994, 19 years later, with West having concreted over the floor of the cellar. Shirley Robinson The first victim buried outside the house, Robinson had an affair with Fred West, and by autumn 1977, she was pregnant with West’s child. It was initially claimed she had moved to Scotland but her body was later found. Alison Chambers The last murder with a sexual motive established. She disappeared just before her 17th birthday, having been seen at 25 Cromwell Street throughout the summer. Her body was buried underneath the patio. Heather West Sexually abused by her parents, she suddenly went missing in 1987, with Rosemary claiming she had gone to Wales to be with a lesbian partner. The couple would joke to their other children that they would “end up under the patio like Heather” if they misbehaved. This, and their changing stories, led to the search warrants for the property and later their arrests.

In 1995 Rose was convicted of 10 murders, while Fred, who admitted 12 murders, hanged himself while on remand.

He had confessed to killing up to 30 victims.

Although Rose has never admitted the crimes, the documentary hears that she became the dominant one in the relationship, and that she encouraged her husband to kidnap and murder for her own sexual pleasure.

“The women that gave evidence at her trial described worse treatment at her hands than at his,” says Jane.

“She learned violence and sexual violence from her father, then from Fred and in my opinion, she outdid him on that.

“He encouraged her to practice sadomasichism on the kids and she didn’t hold back. She was cold, callous and violent.

“These were very young girls and it was almost as if she’d had this rotten childhood so she was punishing them as a younger version of herself.”

Josh and Jill, unfortunately, have a dark past as she – along with sister Jessa – revealed in a 2015 interview with Megyn Kelly that they had been two of five female minors he had allegedly molested in the early 2000s.

Jill, 29, and her husband Derick, 32, have said they ""hope justice is done"" after her brother Josh was arrested on two counts of child pornography.

The couple exclusively told The Sun that they were ""very sad"" following the news that the soon-to-be father of seven had been indicted.

The former Counting On star is currently estranged from her conservative Christian family as her husband and her father, Jim Bob, feud.

Speaking for the first time since Josh’s arrest, Jill said: ""We’re very sad about the whole thing, it’s horrible. It’s all very sad.

""I don’t think anybody supports child pornography.

""We’re sad for Anna, put yourself in her situation and imagine how you would feel if that happened with your family member.

""I imagine it would be really hard.""

Jill and Derick – who left Counting On in 2017 – were spotted earlier on Saturday exercising near their home in Lowell, Arkansas, with their six-year-old son Israel and three-year-old son Samuel.

Derick jogged while Jill rode a bike with Samuel on a seat behind her and Israel pedaled his own.

Josh, 33, was arrested on Thursday and arraigned on Friday over allegations that he downloaded material that depicted the sexual abuse of children under the age of 12, the US Attorney’s Office in the Western District of Arkansas said.

Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar’s oldest son pleaded not guilty to one count of receipt of child pornography and one of possession of child pornography.

He faces 20 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000 if convicted.

Josh is currently being held in the Fayetteville detention center pending a detention hearing on Wednesday.

His attorney Justin Gelfand has said he intends to defend the case ""aggressively and thoroughly.""

19 Kids and Counting was canceled in 2015 after it was claimed that Josh had abused five young girls – four of his sisters and a family friend – while he was a teen.

He was never charged over those allegations.

On Saturday, Derick appeared to like a tweet calling for the cancellation of Counting On.

Counting On – which began in 2016 after 19 Kids and Counting had been terminated and was meant to focus on the older Duggar kids – never featured Josh.

When asked by The Sun about the tweet, Derick said he was not backing the call to can the show but wanted to see more honesty about it.

He told The Sun: ""People assume that Counting On is a different show from 19 Kids and Counting but it’s not, it’s the same show.

""I’m just frustrated that it’s deceptive to the public to say ‘we’re going to change this or change that’ and it’s the exact same.""

Derick also said that he and his wife are planning on writing a book about their experiences, adding: ""I’m in law school right now so my time is limited but I’ve said for a long time that we are planning on writing a book.

""We’re making notes as we think of things and we want to write something that is tasteful but honest.""

Derick and Jill speaking out comes a few days after Josh was charged with two counts of child pornography on Friday.

According to the indictment, Josh “knowingly received child pornography” between or about May 14, 2019 and on or about May 16, 2019.

For the second count, Josh “knowingly possessed material that contained images of child pornography,” including “images of minors under the age of 12.”

Josh has been ordered to forfeit all visual images and property, including video equipment, related to the case.

The Sun previously broke Josh was arrested for the federal charges in Washington County at 1.15 pm on Thursday afternoon.

An insider claimed Josh ""turned himself in"" without incident.

The head-turning revelation is related to the 2019 Homeland Security raid on Josh's now-shuttered used car dealership in Springdale, Arkansas, another source told The Sun.

In November 2019, Homeland Security conducted an “ongoing federal investigation” at the lot, but no charges were filed against Josh - until now.

A source exclusively told The Sun of the Duggar family: ""The family has known that this has been coming for weeks, and Josh has been preparing himself.

""They are praying together for Josh and Anna, who is standing by her husband as she always has.

""Family members are extremely concerned by what is happening and they just want to find out the truth.

""They know that this will put them in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons, and are stunned they are having to go through this again.""

The insider added: ""The family will be speaking out shortly and hope this in many ways will bring them closer together and even closer to God.""

The arrest comes six years after In Touch Weekly uncovered a 33-page Arkansas police report claiming Jim Bob confessed to local authorities that his eldest son fondled the breasts and genitals of young girls while they were asleep in the Duggar family home back in 2002.

Following the allegations against him, Josh addressed the claim: ""Twelve years ago, as a young teenager, I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret.

""I hurt others, including my family and close friends.""

More allegations followed for Josh, as another report just three months later claimed the former TLC star was using adultery dating service Ashley Madison.

He said: ""I have been the biggest hypocrite ever. While espousing faith and family values, I have secretly over the last several years been viewing pornography on the Internet and this has become a secret addiction and I became unfaithful to my wife.""

Soon after, porn star Danica Dillon, whose real name is Ashley Johnston, claimed he assaulted her during a sexual encounter.

Sir Richard Lexington Sutton, worth £300million, was fatally attacked while his wife Anne Schreiber, 65, also suffered knife wounds and was left in a “critical” condition in hospital.

18

Three hours after the shocking killing in Dorset, police dramatically stopped a Range Rover in Hammersmith, west London, after tracking it across five counties.

They used a ""hard stop"" technique and swung in front of the vehicle - forcing it to brake immediately.

A 34-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and police later confirmed he was known to the victim.

The Sun understands he was living with the couple.

And according to The Times, the suspect had visited the grave of his dad earlier in the day and detectives are considering whether this promoted a breakdown.

The suspect was later taken to hospital with ""self-inflicted"" injuries which were not believed to be life-threatening. He remains in hospital today.

DRAMATIC ARREST

Sir Richard, a baronet described as “a charming country gentleman”, owned a huge portfolio of property across the country, including two Park Lane hotels.

He was so badly wounded that police officers attending the scene initially thought that they were dealing with a gunshot wound, it is understood.

A woman who worked for Sir Richard Sutton Limited told The Sun: “What’s happened is worse than anything on Midsomer Murders. It’s an absolute tragedy.”

On Wednesday evening police dashed to their estate in the tiny hamlet of Higher Langham, near Gillingham, Dorset, after a call from a concerned member of the public.

They found Sir Richard with fatal knife wounds and he was later pronounced dead at the scene.

The hotelier's Danish second wife Anne, a physiotherapist, was airlifted to the Southmead Hospital in Bristol.

Meanwhile, the suspect had fled in a Range Rover, triggering a police operation involving six forces.

The car was tracked after it left Dorset then sped across Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire and Surrey.

Helicopters were also scrambled as the car made its way at high speed towards London.

A team of crack SCO19 firearms officers in an armed response vehicle then moved in on it at 10.30pm in Hammersmith.

Officers ripped open the driver’s door and pulled him from the vehicle.

They then had to carry out immediate first-aid on him as an ambulance was called.

'SELF-INFLICTED INJURIES'

Dramatic pictures also showed serious damage to vehicles and a knife on the ground next to a pair of boots and jeans.

An eyewitness, Maureen Kane, 50, who was at home when the incident occurred, claims up to 40 ""armed"" police officers swarmed the area.

Maureen said: ""I just heard a loud screech of cars swerving and then crash sounds.

""Then I looked out of my window and saw lots of armed police jumping on top of a car and aiming guns at a man and all around his car.

""He was a white male in his 30s and seemed to be injured – it looked pretty bad – but I'm not sure if he was injured in a crash.

""He was naked as they ripped his clothes off and pulled him out of the car.

""I was scared as I thought it was a terrorist and there were so many police officer with guns.”

Sir Richard, 9th Baronet, was head of the Sutton family, owning around 7,000 acres of land in Dorset, Berkshire, London, Lincolnshire and Aberdeenshire.

He inherited his title and estate in 1981 and was 435th on the Sunday Times’ Rich List.

Sir Richard married his first wife Fiamma Sutton in 1959 before they divorced. They had two children, David, 61, and Caroline, 55, and five grandchildren.

Sir Richard was a caring, generous and warm family man, who genuinely regarded those who worked for him as part of his extended family.” Sir Richard Sutton Limited

He later married Anne who has three children from a previous relationship - daughters Louisa, 39, Rose, 35, and son Thomas, 34.

Sir Richard had bought his Moorhill country estate in Dorset in 2014 for £1.4million.

He has owned a huge portfolio of property, farms and hotels across the country, including the five-star Sheraton Grand on London's swanky Park Lane and the Athenaeum in Mayfair.

The millionaire had a sprawling property empire and 7,000 acres of land, is said to be more than the amount owned by the Ministry of Defence.

A spokesman for Sir Richard Sutton Limited said: ""Sir Richard was a caring, generous and warm family man, who genuinely regarded those who worked for him as part of his extended family.”

The local MP Simon Hoare, who knew Sir Richard well, paid tribute to the landowner who he said was a ""country gentleman"".

Sir Richard was landed gentry SIR Richard Lexington Sutton owned a huge swathe of land across the country as well as a hotel empire. He and his family boasted close to 7,000 acres — more than double that owned by the Ministry of Defence. His flagship hotels were the Sheraton Grand and the Athenaeum, both on London’s prestigious Piccadilly. His Settled Estates bought the leasehold on the five-star Sheraton in 2014. The following year it was given a multi-million-pound refit. Suites at the art deco hotel cost up to £1,500 a night. Sir Richard — number 435 on the Sunday Times Rich List — also owned three high-end MGallery hotels in Bath, Cheltenham and Windsor. Another of his firms owns a large farming estate in the Lincolnshire Wolds and 1,800 acres with livestock and arable crops around Stockcross, Berks. One of the village’s pubs, The Lord Lyon, was named after a Sutton family horse that in 1866 won racing’s Triple Crown — the Derby, St Leger and 2,000 Guineas. He bought his home — the Moorhill country estate near Gillingham, Dorset — in 2014 for £1.4million. The baronet’s family title dates back to the time of King James I.

Lisa Montgomery murdered pregnant Bobbie Jo Stinnett in December 2004 and is set to be the first woman to be executed by the federal government in almost 70 years.

Her family are desperate for a reprieve from the lethal injection that she is due to receive in three weeks time.

They claim the jury were told little of her vast mental health problems - caused by rape, trafficking and torture, The Mirror reports.

Montgomery's sister Diane Mattingly said: ""My heart goes out to the family of Bobbie Jo Stinnett and the loss they have felt.

""But my hope is President Trump will stop Lisa’s execution and commute her sentence to life in prison.

""My sister does not deserve to die. She is not the worst of the worst for whom the death penalty was intended. She is the most broken of the broken,"" Diane said.

Trump has been widely slammed for becoming the first president in 130 years to order executions while waiting for president-elect Joe Biden to take office.

Until this year, no one has been killed by the federal government since 2003.

Trump has rubber-stamped ten executions before he leaves office on January 20, and it comes despite president-elect Biden's plans to abolish the federal death penalty.

Montgomery, 52, is due to die on January 12 but her lawyers claim she was suffering from psychosis when she went to Bobbie Jo's home in Skidmore, Missouri 16 years ago.

She strangled the 23-year-old who was eight months pregnant, then cut into her stomach with her kitchen knife and removed the baby from her womb.

The baby, later named as Victoria Jo, survived and celebrated her 16th birthday this week.

Experts believe that Montgomery was ""completely detached"" from reality when she carried out the murder, according to legal documents seen by the Sunday People.

When describing how she felt, she said: ""I'm not in my body, I'm not real.""

It's claimed that the 52-year-old suffers from bipolar disorder and complex post traumatic stress disorder.

Scans reportedly show she has suffered brain damage because her mom allegedly drank during pregnancy.

'INCREDIBLY REMORSEFUL'

One neurologist compared her brain to a ""city hit by a bomb"".

Her lawyer Kelley Henry says her mental health has worsened now she has to live with the “overwhelming pain” of what she did to Bobbie Jo.

She said: ""Lisa is incredibly remorseful. She was spiralling out of control when it happened.""

""She was tortured from birth and repeatedly gang-raped. That causes your mind to detach from reality,"" Ms Henry claimed.

""All we can do is present the facts to President Trump and ask him to exercise mercy.""

It's claimed that Montgomery was forced to marry her stepbrother Carl Boman when she was 18.

Court documents allege that he raped her and poured hot wax on her.

But, Boman was never convicted of raping Lisa.

Bobbie Jo's body was discovered after an hour she was killed on December 16 2004.

In 2007, Montgomery was found guilty of kidnapping resulting in death, by a jury who recommended the death penalty.

Ms Henry claims lawyers who represented Lisa ""bungled"" the evidence.

She said: ""All the evidence of her brain damage was excluded.

Why is Stop Asian Hate trending?

""Stop Asian Hate"" began trending on social media following the bloody attack on Asian spa in Atlanta on March 16 carried out by Aaron Long, 21.

Long was arrested on the night of March 16 after leading cops on a three hour car chase, Cherokee County Sheriff's spokesperson Howard J Baker said.

The Cherokee County reportedly revealed that interviews with Long did not indicate that the shooting was racially motivated or related to hate crimes.

Long did not target the victims due to their ethnicity, rather that he chose locations that he ""knew specifically"", according to Channel 2.

The FBI are now assisting the investigation into the shooting spree, that saw six Asian women shot dead.

Of the eight dead, seven were women and one a man, according to officials.

South Korea has since confirmed that four of the victims were of Korean descent.

Further details have not yet been released on the victims, but Atlanta Police Chief Rodney N. Bryant confirmed the majority were female and Asian.

The rape had left her suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

In the years after, she suffered three miscarriages, leaving her with ""traumatic flashbacks.""

Before her body was discovered, Rachael claimed she had been receiving death threats which made her spiral into a state of anxiety, a coroner heard.

A police constable told an inquest that on the night before Rachael's death she had an argument with her parents Peter and Jackie but it had been resolved.

""Her parents believed everything was okay and Rachael had told them she was going to stay at a friend's house,"" the officer said.

""They last saw her at 10pm. However, at 5.45am her mother went downstairs and found Rachael.""

Emergency service crews rushed to the home in Luton, Beds.

Despite their best efforts, Rachael died from hanging at 6.03am.

Her dad Peter Gallagher - who attended the inquest virtually - raised more than £4,000 on a GoFundMe page for charity on Rachael's behalf.

You're Not Alone EVERY 90 minutes in the UK a life is lost to suicide. It doesn't discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society - from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers. It's the biggest killer of people under the age of 35, more deadly than cancer and car crashes. And men are three times more likely to take their own life than women. Yet it's rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now. That is why The Sun launched the You're Not Alone campaign. The aim is that by sharing practical advice, raising awareness and breaking down the barriers people face when talking about their mental health, we can all do our bit to help save lives.

What happened to Jeff Wittek's eye?

In a video titled My Truth, Jeff Wittek addresses serious claims made against members of the YouTube group Vlog Squad.

But he starts the video by speaking about his eye after a period off camera.

He said he has had ""a couple of eye surgeries"" but ""wanted to keep that part of my life private"".

Jeff said his eye had looked ""pretty gnarly"" so he didn't want to appear publicly.

But he did share a photo of him with a bruised, purple eye and another while in hospital.

The internet personality did not elaborate further on what caused the injury, but it is understood it stemmed from an accident in the summer of 2020.

He shared no further details of the incident, aside from that it was caused while shooting a vlog.

What has Jeff Wittek said about the Vlog Squad?

The Vlog Squad is facing serious allegations of sexual assault.

An explosive article published by Business Insider in March 2020 reported that a woman featured on the channel was raped by member Durte Dom in 2018.

Jeff was dragged into the controversy after it was alleged he bought alcohol for underage girls the same night of the reported sexual assault.

He denies the allegations, but photos show he was there while the victim was carried out of the apartment.

And her friend told Insider she recalls Jeff going out to buy drinks that same night.

In the My Truth video, Jeff claims the only person who accused him of buying alcohol for minors was Trisha Paytas - whom he has a ongoing feud with following her messy breakup with his friend Jason Nash.

He added: ""It just makes me angry because it is so not true.""

6 Jeff has said he had 'absolutely nothing to do with' the events on the night of the alleged rape

He concluded by accusing both Trisha and Insider of spreading fake news.

But Jeff has said what Dom did was ""horrible and disgusting"" and he has donated money to a charity which helps victims of sexual assault.

He has also reiterated that he had ""absolutely nothing to do"" with the events that night.

Jeff tweeted this week: ""My heart goes out entirely to the victim. I am truly sorry you were in that situation, which I was not aware of at the time.

""The disgusting actions Dom had committed to you, I absolutely do not condone.

""I've done a lot of dumb s**t in my life but if I was in the room where a girl was potentially going to get assaulted, I would absolutely never ever sit there and let that happen.

Nicola Holton, 36, told the teenager ""she could not wait until 2023 when he would be 18"" and preyed on him on two occasions, a court heard.

The mother contacted her 15-year-old victim saying she needed help with an online game her son was playing.

She lured him to her home by inviting him to watch a film then made him kiss her and put her hand down his trousers.

The sick mum gave him oral sex and also used her hands to perform a sexual act on another occasion.

Holton, of Worcester, Worcs., was jailed for four years at Worcester Crown Court yesterday.

She admitted two counts of sexual activity with a child and one of sexual communication with a child between August 31 and October 10 last year.

Prosecutor Caroline Harris told the court the boy had said he ""wanted it to stop and then he would just be a normal child"".

JAILED FOR ABUSE

Mrs Harris said Holton ""put her hand inside his trousers"" and performed two sex acts on him with her hand and her mouth.

Holton also later sent him messages ""suggesting she was pleasuring herself"". The victim said he removed those messages because he did not want to see them.

On another occasion she again kissed him and used her hands to perform a sexual act.

Mrs Harris said: ""He felt he could not say anything about what happened because he was afraid he would get into trouble.

""He was asking the officer what his punishment might be for what had happened.

""It was noted by the officer that he was in tears at various stages, showing the distress that has been caused.""

BOY FELT HE WOULD BE 'JUDGED'

Holton even told the boy ""she could not wait until 2023 when he would be 18"" and that she had to keep on reminding herself ""he was only 15"".

The prosecutor said: ""He does recall feeling pressured to do as he did.""

In a statement from the boy's mother she described how her son had struggled to sleep and had become reluctant to be seen out of the house following the incidents.

She said he felt he would be looked at, questioned and “judged” over what happened.

His mother said: ""I noticed a real change in him. He was coming in from school and becoming immediately angry. He had turned into someone I did not recognise at all.""

Fiona Elder, defending, said Holton had ""an inability to cope on her own"" after a controlling relationship with her ex-husband.

VICTIM BLAMING

Judge Nicolas Cartwright said: ""You seduced him, kissing him, taking him into your bedroom in your flat then performing oral sex upon him.""

He told her that she then went on to ""repeat the behaviour"", that the boy had been ""conflicted"" after the first occasion and ""sent messages initially saying he did not want your sexual attention"".

The judge said: ""You should have known a good deal better in any event given that you were working in childcare and have obtained a diploma. You were very well aware of how serious this offending was.""

He also noted ""you have two boys of your own and you could have been under no illusions just how serious your actions were.""

Judge Cartwright also said she had not expressed ""significant remorse"".

He added: ""Your sorrow was only for the fact you had found yourself remanded in custody. There was a good deal of victim blaming going on during the course of that interview.""

Holton can expect to serve half of the custodial sentence in custody and half on licence in the community.

An indefinite restraining order and a sexual harm prevention order were also made.

Cops in Washington State have issued a warrant for the 19-year-old's arrest on Thursday after he failed to attend a preliminary court hearing regarding the allegations.

6 Rapper Lil Mosey has been charged with rape, according to reports Credit: Getty

Lil Mosey, real name Lathan M. Echols, was charged with second-degree rape two weeks ago.

Adel ""Ace"" Sadik, one of Mosey's former managers, said he did not know why the rapper did not appear in court this week.

Asked how Mosey responds to the allegations, Sadik told the Seattle Times: ""That’s all on him and the courts to figure out. I can’t really speak on that on his behalf.""

Sadik told the outlet that he does not represent Lil Mosey and is ""not involved in his career.""

Court documents claim Echols ""engaged in sexual intercourse with another person"" on January 6, 2020 in Washington's Lewis County.

The person he was with ""was incapable of consent by reason of being physically helpless or mentally incapacitated,"" the documents read, detailing a shocking story of how the rapper had himself onto an unconscious woman.

On that January morning, Detective Michael Mohr contacted the friend of the woman Echols is accused of raping ""and learned that she had received a text from her friend about going to a party at a cabin in Randle.""

When they arrived, there were several people already there the two girls said they ""did not know and kept to themselves most of the night.""

“At one point, someone brought White Claws and champagne and they had some to drink.""

The friend said “she does not remember much after drinking the champagne but remembered waking up in an upstairs bedroom in her bra and underwear and someone said there was video of her having sex.""

She added “there were a lot of boys in the room and that she grabbed” the woman Echols is accused of raping “and they left the area in their vehicle.”

When Mohr contacted the victim and her mother to investigate, “it was learned at that point that [the woman] had no specific memory of a rape taking place.”

“She remembered people saying she had sex, but could not recall who said that and did not remember engaging in sexual intercourse.”

When she and her friend went to their vehicle, “Echols got in the car and pulled his pants down.”

That’s when the woman said “this is where her memory gets fuzzy. She said the next thing she remembered is being in the cabin with guys on her, and ‘Cisco,’ later identified was Francisco Prater, saying ‘Wake up, wake up, suck this dick, b***h.’”

The woman admitted to “having consensual sex with Echols while he was in the car,” but not with Prater, saying “she remembered Prater being on her and her eyesight being ‘weird.’”

“She said he had his ‘dick’ out and she remembered pulling it out because it ‘hurt.’ She said that Prater was on top of her between her legs and said that the next say her hips hurt.”

“She added that at one point she opened her eyes and saw ‘two dicks’ and said that she ‘watched it come out of me, like I was pulling it out.’”

“She said that she remembered one of them trying to force a dick inside her mouth.”

The woman said she “received a message from one of the people at the party that said the guys were talking about ‘training two girls.'""

She also had injuries she could not explain, including bruising on her arm, neck, and inner knees.

About a month later, the woman contacted Mohr saying she remembered parts of that night.

The woman ""remembered being carried by Prater at the top of the stairs in the cabin and hitting her head on something. She was then laid down on a bed and blacked out.""

""When she woke up she said that Echols was already in the room and he got on top of her and was pushing her legs up and apart while he was having sex with her.""

""She said she recalled having pain in her leg muscles while Echols was pushing her legs. She said she blacked out again and woke up to Prater ‘forcing his dick in her.’ It was during that when Echols left the room to go downstairs.""

The woman claims a short time later, Mosey got on top of her and pushed her legs up and apart.

She alleges that she remembers having pain in her legs as he was doing this.

Dobrik's YouTube channel has more than 18.7million subscribers.

Who is David Dobrik?

Dobrik rose to popularity on the popular video-sharing platform and is popular with Generation Z, according to Business Insider.

He first began uploading videos on video-sharing app Vine before focusing on YouTube.

The 24-year-old was born in Slovakia before his family immigrated to a Chicago suburb when he was six-years-old.

In 2013, he and some friends moved to Los Angeles and started gaining popularity from Vine videos. He started with sports highlights before doing more comedic videos.

His videos include his group of friends dubbed the Vlog Squad. The squad includes other well-known YouTube stars including Toddy Smith and Scotty Sire.

After Vine shuttered, Dobrik started his channel on YouTube. He now has two channels, David Dobrik and David Dobrik Too. Both channels combined have almost 30 million subscribers and billions of views.

He also has a YouTube channel, Views, with Jason Nash.

Why is David Dobrik trending?

An anonymous woman said she appeared in a Vlog Squad video in late 2018, Business Insider reported on March 16.

The woman said Dobrik filmed her having a threesome with former Vlog Squad member Dom Zeglatis aka Durete Dom. She said she was too drunk to give consent and Zeglaitis raped her.

The accuser, who was 20 at the time of the incident, alleged members of the Vlog Squad supplied alcohol to her and her friends, although it is unclear whether Dobrik was one such member.

The accuser and her friends went and met with the Vlog Squad to shoot a video.

Shortly after the Business Insider interview was published, Dobrik posted a video responding to the allegations. His video was trending on YouTube and social media.

Several companies have cut ties with the YouTuber and the Vlog Squad following the allegations.

On Sunday, Dobrik announced that he would be stepping down from the board of Dispo — the photo-sharing app he co-founder — hours after Spark Capital, a major investor in the company, said it had decided to “sever all ties with the company”.

Dispo, in a statement to TechCrunch, said: ""David has chosen to step down from the board and leave the company to not distract from the company’s growth.

""Dispo’s team, product, and most importantly our community, stand for building a diverse, inclusive, and empowering world.""

In February, Dobrik and Nash were accused of sexual assault by Seth Francois, a former Vlog Squad member.

In a YouTube video posted in 2017, Francois was made to believe he was going to kiss a female Vlog Squad member while being blindfolded. He instead kissed Nash.

""I honestly didn't realize how much that situation affected me until the beginning of last year when COVID happened,"" Francois told BuzzFeed News.

""I remember sitting in my room in Atlanta and I was thinking to myself, That video was wrong,"" he said.

""I just felt like that shouldn't have happened to me.""

Francois told BuzzFeed News he didn't give Nash consent to kiss him and he called a sexual assualt hotline to discuss the incident.

""They (the hotline) said it directly to me. They said, 'I'm sorry you were sexually assaulted.' And I broke down,"" Francois said.

""I called my mother and some of my close friends and I said, 'I can't believe that happened to me,"" he continued.

What did David Dobrik say?

In the video, which responds to both sets of allegations, Dobrik begins by saying making videos and making people happy is all he wants to do.

""Consent is something that's super, super important to me.

""Whether I am shooting with a friend, or I am shooting with a stranger, I make sure whatever video I am putting out I have the approval from that person,"" he said.

Dobrik said he has distanced himself from people he doesn't film with anymore like Dom.

""I've been really disappointed by some of my friends."" he said.

He apologized directly to Francois.

""With the Seth situation, I am sorry to Seth,"" he said.

The unnamed 19-year-old was found guilty by a Cypriot judge of making up claims she was attacked by 12 Israelis.

But many have raised doubts over the case, with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab saying he had “very serious concerns” about her treatment.

And Brit cops have now said she will be offered family liaison and victim support services when she returns home, The Times reports.

Anyone convicted of lying about rape by a British court would be denied these, reflecting doubts over the fairness of the girl’s trial.

Derbyshire constabulary said: “We will be providing support to the family and to the teenage girl and that will take various forms, one of which will be signposting and support around her as a victim of rape because she maintains that she is a victim.”

The woman boarded a flight back to the UK on Tuesday after a judge gave her a suspended jail term for “public mischief”.

But despite being given a suspended sentence, the teen has vowed to clear her name with the help of a team of legal experts.

Lawyers now have just ten days to submit an appeal to the Supreme Court of Cyprus and will then wait to see if it has been accepted by a tribunal.

'MY FIGHT GOES ON'

A specialist in human rights and part of the teen's defence, Nicoletta Charalambidou, told Sun Online: ""We are preparing to submit an expedited appeal request so that it can be heard within six months.

""We have ten days from the day of sentencing, but will likely use all of them to prepare the ground properly.""

After landing back in the UK the young woman was overcome with emotion and told The Sun how she was desperate to enjoy England’s “cold weather”, tuck into a “cheeky Nando’s” and go for walks with her pet dog again.

The woman, who insists she is innocent, vowed: “My fight goes on”.

She and her mother boarded a BA jet from Larnaca to London after two passengers gave up their seats for 550 euros, following an appeal for volunteers by airline staff.

In an exclusive interview, she said: “I really thought it would be a custodial sentence when I arrived at court. When the translator said four months, I thought I was going to jail.

“It was only when she said suspended that I realised I was actually finally going home. I looked at my mum and we both had tears in our eyes. I’m so delighted to be going home.”

The teen voiced appreciation to hundreds of donors to her legal fund — many of them loyal Sun readers.

She added: “I want to thank everyone who has supported me. I am innocent and the fight will go on to clear my name.

'A NIGHTMARE'

“It’s been a nightmare for me, mum and everyone. Now I just want to be with my friends and family.

“What kept me going was my family and the amazing support of my friends and all other people who got in contact to say they believed me.

“Now, at last, I can go home to my own bed. I’m even looking forward to the cold weather back in England!

“I can’t wait to have a cheeky Nando’s and to take my dog for a long walk through the countryside.”

The teenager, who has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, was forced to spend nearly five weeks in prison on remand in a cell with up to nine other women.

Even after being granted bail in August, she was kept under virtual house arrest in a villa in the holiday resort of Ayia Napa and had her passport seized.

Her lawyers have already begun work on the appeal. Judge Michalis Papathanasiou suspended her jail term for three years, and ordered her to pay £125 court fees.

He told her he was giving her a “second chance” after last week convicting her despite huge holes in the prosecution’s case.

'VERY AGGRESSIVE'

The judge sparked fury by insisting “all the evidence shows that she had lied”. He dismissed expert defence witnesses as “unreliable” while ruling all prosecution ones “credible”.

Prosecutors also tried to pass off injuries to the woman — said to have been caused when she was held down by her attackers — as “jellyfish stings”.

She told The Sun: “I felt the judge was very aggressive towards me and vindictive. He was misogynistic towards me and my female defence team. They were barely allowed to ask questions and yet the prosecutor had me on the stand for six hours.”

Well-wishers chanted outside the court yesterday and held signs saying, “We Believe You”.

Her ordeal began last summer after she flew to Ayia Napa for a working holiday before university. On July 17 — in floods of tears — she and a pal rushed to tell cops she had been gang-raped by a group of Israelis. Police arrested the 12 suspects aged 16 to 19, but later released them.

Cops then accused her of making up the claims. She was quizzed for eight hours without a lawyer before being ordered to sign a dictated statement retracting her allegations.

Last night the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “The Foreign Office will be working with Cyprus and other countries on how we can avoid cases like this happening again.

“We have had numerous concerns about the judicial process in this case.

Cyprus rape case – Brit teen free to fly home after being spared jail over Ayia Napa gang rape claim","['Tom Michael', 'Rebecca Husselbee', 'Nick Pisa', 'Tom Wells']","A BRIT teen convicted of lying about being raped in Ayia Napa will be treated as a sex attack victim in the UK, police said today.
The unnamed 19-year-old was found guilty by a Cypriot judge of making up claims she was attacked by 12 Israelis.
And Brit cops have now said she will be offered family liaison and victim support services when she returns home, The Times reports.
Anyone convicted of lying about rape by a British court would be denied these, reflecting doubts over the fairness of the girl’s trial.
