A group of moms who lost their children to gun violence - from activist group Moms Demand Action - spoke at the vigil to reflect and pray together.

Deandra Dycus, whose 13-year-old son was injured after being hit by a stray bullet, led the vigil.

Addressing the crowd, she said: ""It is okay not to be okay and feel free to reach out to any of us in those moments when you are not okay.""

The mom and activist added: ""To those who haven't been impacted by gun violence directly as we have, I salute you for being here and wanted to stand up to this cause, this monster, this beast, this demon that is terrorising us.

""So I thank you and I appreciate you for joining us in this fight.

""We are doing this in the hope that you will never have to walk in our shoes.

""My heart just goes out to the mums and the families because when we see it, we hurt all over again.""

Other vigils are set to take place to honor the victims of the shooting, including one at 7pm.

It comes as photographs of some of the eight victims were revealed.

In a post by police on Friday evening, the victims were named by Marion County Coroner’s Office (MCCC) as: Matthew R Alexander, 32; Samaria Blackwell, 19; Amarjeet Johal, 66; Jasvinder Kaur, 64; Jaswinder Singh, 68; Amarjit Skhon, 48; Karlie Smith, 19; and John Weisert, 74.

The 19-year-old gunman had been interviewed by agents last year, when his mom expressed concerns and a shotgun was seized from the teenager's home.

Indy Genesis, a homeschool athletic association based in the city, released images of one of its athletes, 19-year-old victim Samaria Blackwell.

According to one of her teammates, “Samaria was always smiling and cracking jokes. She was so loving, goofy, encouraging, and supportive.”

A GoFundMe campaign has now been set up to raise money for the Blackwell family.

At least seven other people were injured during the rampage on Thursday night, which ended with the shooter turning the gun on himself.

It marks the latest in a string of mass shootings across America in recent weeks, also becoming the third mass shooting in Indianapolis this year.

On Friday, the FBI confirmed that it had interviewed Hole last year, after his mother called police to say that her son might commit ""suicide by cop.""

The call was made in March 2020, and a shotgun was later seized from Hole's residence, the FBI said in a statement.

VICTIMS NAMED

The suspected shooter had purchased the shotgun just 24 hours before he was arrested, according to reports.

Hole was then interviewed in April, when it was deemed that no racially motivated violent extremism (RMVE) ideology had been identified during the assessment.

When he was released, Hole was reportedly deemed no further threat to the community.

According to police, a gunman identified as Hole opened fire at a FexEx facility in Indianapolis on Tuesday night, killing eight people before turning the gun on himself.

According to Indianapolis Deputy Chief Craig McCartt, Hole was a former FedEx employee, having last worked for the company in 2020.

McCartt said he did not know why Hole left the job, but family members told FOX59 he was fired.

Authorities said in a press conference on Friday that Hole was also arrested in 2013 – though it was not made clear for what reason.

McCartt said that investigators do not know the motive of the shooting, adding that the gunman carried out the shooting rampage with a rifle, which they do no know if he purchased legally.

Following the shooting, family and friends said they struggled to reach loved ones at the facility who were not able to have their phones on them at work.

KNOWN TO AUTHORITIES

Throughout Friday morning, some expressed relief as they managed to contact loved ones, while others struggled to reach works, questioning FedEx's policies.

Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said the community must guard against resignation and “the assumption that this is simply how it must be and we might as well get used to it.”

President Joe Biden said he had been briefed on the shooting and called gun violence “an epidemic” in the U.S.

Elsewhere, eight people were fatally shot in massage businesses across Atlanta last month, and 10 people were shot in a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado.","['Chiara Fiorillo', 'Jack Williams']","A VIGIL for the innocent victims of the FedEx shooting has taken place in Indianapolis.

The rape survivor named six people who attacked her in the hotel near India Gate in Delhi on Friday.

A man from the Sheikh Sarai area of Delhi has been arrested in connection with the brutal attack.

Police said the tour guide made a distressed call the day after the incident, which happened in a five-star central Delhi hotel room.

The room had been booked under the names of two businessmen, according to reports.

The survivor said the accused called her to the hotel under the pretext of granting her a loan at low rates because she was in ""dire need of money.""

Deputy Commissioner of Police, New Delhi, Eish Singhal told NDTV: ""On the victim's complaint, a case was registered against 6 accused persons including one woman.

""The victim was lured to the hotel room on the pretext of providing a loan at subsidized rates by the accused persons.

""The victim worked as a tourist guide-cum-ticket booking agent and she was in dire need of money.

""The room was booked under the name of two business persons.""

RAPE HORROR

Police are further investigating the other people accused.

Earlier this month, a teenage girl claimed she was raped by an ambulance driver as she was taken to hospital for coronavirus treatment in India.

The 29-year-old is said to have launched the sex attack on the 19-year-old as she was driven to a treatment centre.

And in August, another horrific sex attack was reported after a teenager was raped and murdered before her ""mutilated"" body was found dumped in a sugarcane field.

The 13-year-old girl's father claims her tongue had been cut and her eyes gouged out - although police have disputed this, according to reports.

The alleged incident took place in Pakaria village close to the Nepal border in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri district.

Nearly 34,000 rapes are reported in India each year despite the introduction of tougher laws in recent years.

Rape and sexual violence has been under the spotlight in India since the 2012 gang rape and murder of a young woman in the capital Delhi, which prompted thousands demanding stricter laws.

Prison sentences for rapists were doubled to 20 years as well as well as criminalising voyeurism, stalking and trafficking of women.

Indian MPs also voted to lower the age at which a person can be tried as an adult for heinous crimes to 16 from 18.

Paul Flores was detained for the murder of Smart on Tuesday, but the Los Angeles Police Department has since confirmed that it's also investigating three separate sexual assault allegations against the 44-year-old.

Detectives with the LAPD told FOX11 that three sexual assault cases against Flores have been presented to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office for filing.

The cases reportedly involve three separate victims on three separate dates. The department offered no further information.

The local DA's office will now decide if there's sufficient evidence to pursue charges in relation to each of the allegations.

In a press conference on Wednesday, San Luis Obispo District Attorney Dan Dow asked the public to come forward with any information they may have about Flores committing additional crimes, including ""assaults or other acts.""

Dow said investigators believe Flores may be responsible for another sexual assaults in the Los Angeles area, adding he often frequented bars near his home in San Pedro from 2005 up until his arrest.

“Evidence of other sexual crimes may be used,” Dow said. “We intend to use evidence of other sexual crimes to prove the [Smart case].

""If you've been a victim in another location, perhaps in San Pedro, we want you to come forward to law enforcement so that you can get assistance that you need and it may help us in this particular case as well.""

As reported by The Sun on Wednesday, Flores has previously been accused of rape and of sexual assault - with some of those allegations pre-dating the disappearance of Smart.

Its' unclear if any of those prior allegations are among the three cases of sexual assault currently being investigated by the LAPD.

One of those accusers was even a student at California Polytechnic State University when she claims Flores assaulted her - months before Smart disappeared from the campus on May 25, 1996, having last been seen alive with Flores.

The first of those accusations allegedly took place in 1994, when a woman, identified only as Jane, claims Flores roofied, raped and discarded her when she was a 15-year-old sophomore in high school.

She claims Flores handed her a drink and she passed out. She claims she later came to, to find Flores ""on top of me. I know I didn’t have any pants on and he was in me and I could feel him,” she told The Daily Beast.

""He was staring at my face looking at me and he was enjoying himself.”

After that, Jane says she blacked out. The next thing she remembers, she claims, was being dragged down a dimly lit street, with Flores pulling her by one of her arms, and his friend pulling her by the other.

“They took off running,” Jane said. “I remember thinking: ‘If my mom’s not home I’m going to die right here.’”

Jane's mother reportedly rushed her to hospital, and her father called police.

According to Jane, however, Arroyo Grande cops sided with Flores, favoring with his story that she willingly drank and had sex that night.

""We can’t do anything because [Paul] and his friend are saying she was drunk and it was consensual,"" Jane claimed police told her.

“I was like ‘It wasn’t. I blacked out and didn’t consent to anything.’”

When contacted by the Daily Beast, the Arroyo Grande Police Department initially said they couldn't find any records relating to the case. Another spokesperson said the case fell under a ""non-disclosure category"" and therefore they wouldn’t be providing any specific information about it.

The Sun has reached out to AGPD for further clarity.

Later, in 1995 - just months before Smart vanished - a Cal Poly student, who identified herself as Sarah, told The Beast Flores used to ""stalk"" her.

At a Halloween party that year, Sarah claims Flores grabbed her crotch on the dance floor.

“He grabbed me down there and while I’m yelling at him my girlfriend threw a piece of gum at his face and he pushes her down.”

Responding to the fracas, a group of male attendees reportedly chased Flores out of the function.

Later the same year, she claims Flores once again pursued her at another party, when she sat down to go to the bathroom and he ""kicked the door open.""

""He slammed me and then pushed me up against the inside wall by the toilet, his hands were on my upper arms and he started telling me all these sick things he was going to do to me,"" Sarah claimed.

After Flores allegedly told her he was going to ""rape"" her, she says she kneed him in the groin and kicked him the shin, before alerting others.

Sarah's ex-boyfriend says he was among those that raced to confront Flores.

Corroborating Sarah's story, he told the Beast: ""I got in his face. I told him, ‘You never do this again! You never look at her again! If you come near her again I will kill you!’”

One of his friends reportedly pushed Flores through a table and he allegedly fled.

Before Flores was suspected in Smart’s disappearance, he was accused of stalking another female on campus.

A police report dated March 27, 1996, said an intoxicated Flores was accused ""around Christmas"" of attempting to break into a Cal Poly coed’s apartment.

Flores allegedly “climbed up her balcony and she suspected he attempted to break into her apartment,"" the police reported stated.

The identity of the female student in that incident remains unclear, though no claims of sexual assault were made.

She also refused to press charges, but said she had received countless anonymous phone calls across a period of six weeks that she believed Flores was responsible for.

A third woman, one of Flores' cousins, told the Beast she watched him pin down another of their female cousin's and fondle her beneath her bathing suit during a family vacation in the 1990s.

A fourth accuser, a former girlfriend of Flores', described him to the outlet as sexually aggressive, and recounted how he allegedly held a knife to her face during a sexual encounter in 2002, ignoring her cries of ""Stop!"" until their roommate burst in to intervene.

Paul Flores was arrested for Smart's murder at his San Pedro home on Tuesday.

A former classmate of Smart's at California Polytechnic State University, he was the last person to see her alive, having offered to walk her back to her dorm after an off-campus frat party on Memorial Day weekend, 1996.

Smart never made it home that night was reported missing three days later.

Four different cadaver dogs would later alert to the mattress in Flores' dorm room, signalling for the scent of death.

But numerous falterings in the investigation would follow - including lost evidence and missed leads - leaving Smart's family without answers for 25 years.

However, finally on Wednesday, Dow revealed that prosecutors believe Flores murdered Smart during an attempted rape.

When questioned as to how they believe Flores carried out the killing, Dow refused to divulge details, insisting that information will be shared in court.

He also didn't specify where prosecutors believe the alleged murder took place, but said Flores' dorm room ""was a crime scene"".

Also detained on Tuesday was Flores' father, 80-year-old Ruben Flores, who police believe helped his son to dispose of Smart's remains.

The arrests came just one month after the younger Flores was identified as the ""prime suspect"" in Smart's killing, and after cadaver dogs were seen searching Ruben Flores' home in Arroyo Grande.

While immediately considered a person of interest in the case, San Luis Obispo Sheriff Ian Parkinson said Paul Flores officially became a suspect in 2016 after unspecified evidence came to light.

His arrest, alongside his father, followed new evidence investigators acquired in the last two years, Parkinson told the media on Tuesday.

Parkinson said thanks to new witnesses coming forward, and numerous searches of several properties belonging to the Flores' family, investigators were able to uncover forensic and physical evidence tying the father-son duo to Smart's murder.

The Sheriff's office have also been surveying Paul Flores' phone calls and text messages for the last two years, which Parkinson said helped uncover some ""helpful"" evidence.

The major developments in the case over the last two years were partially credited to a podcast, called Your Own Backyard, which renewed interest in the case upon its release in 2019.

The podcast outlined dozens of accusations of groping, stalking, and sexual assault against Flores from a myriad of former classmates, colleagues and acquaintances.

During the investigation into Smart's disappearance, other students at Cal Poly described Flores as a loner, an outsider, and in some cases predatory.

As pointed out by the LA Times in 2006, one friend of Smart's told investigators that she and her friends would refer to Flores as ""Chester the Molestor"" because he was allegedly renowned for groping girls at parties.

In a police report filed by a campus patrol officer a week after Kristin's disappearance, it was claimed: ""Smart does not have any close friends at Cal Poly.""

Other students told CBS News that Flores was known as a ""creeper"", ""scary Paul"" and said 'You wouldn't want to be alone in a room with him.""

The 24-year old alleged in a YouTube video that Paul, also 24, assaulted her at the Team 10 house, where he lives with several friends.

The US Sun reached out to Paul's representation for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication.

The pair met through a mutual friend, and when they first encountered one another, Paradise believed they were going to a “studio” to hang out, which turned out to be the Team 10 residence.

Paradise said in the video that she was aware of Paul, but hadn’t watched his videos and did not know she would be meeting him.

Right away, she said, Paul asked for her phone number, and they began a series of text exchanges starting in June 2019. The alleged assault happened in July during one of the few times they were alone together at the house.

She claimed the YouTube star would invite her over, but then not interact with her in person while she was there, calling him “awkward.” She added that girls would come over and “basically throw themselves at him,"" and, “He would go to his room with a different girl, multiple different girls every day.""

Paradise noted that Paul was “nice” to her until the day of the incident, when he kissed her and she got the sense that he was doing it in front of his friends to “show off” before inviting her to his room.

The TikTok star claimed Paul seemed impressed when she was asking about his past, but she wasn’t sure if that was “just a card he plays.”

After they talked a bit, Paradise claimed, “We were dancing in his room, like ballroom dancing,” before Paul led her to his bed, where they kissed and she said she would move his hands if she wasn’t comfortable with where he was placing them.

Paradise said in the video that “Sex is very special and very important to me,"" and that, “Normally, everybody respects me when I don't want to do sexual things, so I thought that it was fine if I went in his room and I thought it would be fine to kiss him, because I thought he would stop if I didn't want to do anything else.""

But Paradise alleged that instead of just continuing to make out or asking her to leave, Paul then “undid his pants and grabbed my face and started f**king my face.”

The TikTok content creator claimed “I couldn't tell him to stop,"" and that Paul “just shoved himself in me, he didn't ask for consent or anything. That's not OK. On no level at all is that OK.""

“He knew I didn’t want to do anything with him,” she said in the nearly 21-minute video.

Paradise said that after the alleged assault, Paul didn’t even want to let her clean herself up before they went back downstairs.

“Why would you sexually assault me and then not even let me fix my hair and makeup?” she questioned in the YouTube upload.

The 24-year-old woman said he was “straight-up rude” after the incident and did a “complete 180.” Before, she said, “He had been nice to me, he had been sweet to me.”

Paradise noted she tried to get in touch with Paul after because “I wanted to talk to him about how that made me feel,” but that he stopped responding to her after that date.

“I never got an apology,” she said. “Just because I let you kiss me and I let you hold my hand and I let you dance with me in your room, that doesn’t give you the right…”

Paradise said one of the reasons she waited to speak out was because she signed a nondisclosure agreement, and that ""I thought that if you sign an NDA, you're signing away your rights to talk about anything basically.”

The TikTok star said she ultimately decided to say something because “The more and more I think about it, the more I realize no one could be doing that and think that it’s something right to do.”

“I think about it every single day,” she said.

Paradise also thought calling Paul out publicly might make him address it, or at least be a warning to other girls who could find themselves in a similar situation.

“Even if you don't believe me, at least it will be in the back of your mind when you're with him,” she said.

https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14362955/ti-tiny-first-photos-since-sex-assault-accusations/,2021-03-16 21:23:31+00:00,TI & Tiny look tense as they’re seen out in public for first time since claims they drugged and forced victims into sex,"TI and his wife Tameka “Tiny” Harris are seen out in public for the first time since being accused of multiple sex assaults against at least 11 women.

The Atlanta-based stars and their children were spotted enjoying a night out at the famous BOA Steakhouse in West Hollywood.

TI, wearing a white hoodie with “Cookies” written on the front and Tiny, 45, in a gray hoodie, stood maskless as they posed for photographers outside the celebrity hotspot.

Father-of-six TI, whose real name is Clifford Harris, 40, refused to discuss the sex assault allegations when asked to comment by the photographers.

But his Atlanta-based lawyer, Steve Sadow, has vehemently denied all the allegations made against the Grammy-winning star and his wife which according to victims’ attorney Tyrone A. Blackburn include ""eerily similar"" alleged instances of rape, drugging and kidnap over several years.

No criminal charges have been brought against the couple and Mr Sadow told The Sun on behalf of his clients after the restaurant visit: “The Harrisses continue to absolutely deny these scurrilous and unsubstantiated accusations made by attorney Blackburn’s clients.

“We await Blackburn exposing his anonymous accusers to the light of day by revealing their names.

“Only then will we be in a position to confront their allegations with true facts.

“By the lawyer choosing instead to misuse the media for his own publicity and hiding the identities of his clients from the public and us, he makes it impossible for us to comment further now.

“We remain confident that if the claims are thoroughly and fairly investigated, no charges will be brought.”

Also speaking exclusively to The Sun, New York-based Mr Blackburn said his phone has been “ringing off the hook” with more alleged victims since he gave a press conference announcing he would be representing 11 women in late February.

12 The group paused for a few moments before heading inside the famous restaurant Credit: BackGrid

He also insisted the women’s claims “are not an attempt at a shakedown” and he is “determined to get justice” and will not reveal the alleged victims' identities “for their own protection.”

Mr Blackburn said at a virtual press conference on February 28 he has contacted attorney generals in California and Georgia with “eerily similar” claims from the victims - who do not know each other - dating from 2005 up to 2017 or 2018, which include allegations of “sexual abuse, forced ingestion of illegal narcotics, kidnapping, terroristic threats and false imprisonment.”

One woman, a military veteran, alleges that in September 2005, Tiny gave her a drugged drink in an LA hotel room during which TI massaged her and tried to put his foot in her vagina.

She refused and remembers waking up naked on a couch.

Another woman says she was 17 and an intern at the couple’s Atlanta studio in the summer of 2006 when Tiny told her to take off her dress to cool down.

She says she passed out and woke up with a bleeding vagina.

She alleges she was driven to a pharmacy by another of the couple’s employees for emergency contraception and was threatened not to talk about the incident.

Another woman claims in 2007 she was introduced to a security guard by Tiny and the guard then stalked her and two months later allegedly held a gun to her head, blindfolded her, put her in a car, raped her three times over 24 hours and threatened to kill her if she talked about it.

“My phone has been ringing off the hook since the press conference,” Mr Blackburn said.

“There is a myriad of stories and I am currently working through their claims.

12 Tiny wore a gray hoodie as she went into the venue Credit: BackGrid

“I need to check that everyone I deal with has evidence of their claims or a witness to back up their accounts.”

He also told of the “years of suffering” the women had experienced following their alleged attacks, including being suicidal.

“When these victims are drugged, there’s no one way it affects them,"" he said.

“Unfortunately, for some of the women, they’ve had to go to outpatient clinics and they’ve suffered drug addiction that stems from the alleged interactions with Mr and Mrs Harris.

“One woman was very suicidal after her alleged encounter with Mr and Mrs Harris.

12 The couple were travelling around LA in a black SUV Credit: BackGrid

“It has also impacted their ability to have meaningful relationships with men.

“And it’s a good question as to why they’ve hired a man to represent them.

“It has been hard for me to win over their trust.

“It has been hard to get them to believe when I say that the only goal we have is getting justice for them.

“They will never be made whole from a conviction but at least pieces of them can be put back intact, just knowing that what happened to them did not go unchecked.”

He also told The Sun: “I’ve spoken to two attorney generals’ offices so far, I cannot disclose details about what was said or what was passed on.

“I do not want to jeopardise any investigation that may be forthcoming.

“Right now it’s just discussions.

“But I am taking this seriously and I will not rest until there is a chance for justice.

“The decision for the investigation is not up to me, it is up to prosecutors.

“They have to make the decision, do they want Mr and Mrs Harris to go around allegedly drugging 17 year olds.

“They have to make the decision, do they want to have Mr and Mrs Harris going around allegedly trying to insert a foot into the vagina of a veteran.

“They have to make the decision do they want them to allegedly play a role in holding someone against their will for three days and force them to engage in sex acts.

“I do not want to re-victimise these women again through something I said or that a key piece of evidence is not allowed to be used.

“I have to be very careful.

“This is not about money, it is about justice. It's why I will not name these women, their identities must be protected.

“I’ve never asked the Harrises or their legal counsel for a dollar and I do not intend to.”

12 The couple's former friend Sabrina Peterson was the first to make an allegation of violence against T.I. Credit: Instagram

He told The Sun he was “not shocked” and “not surprised” about the number of women now coming forward.

Mr Blackburn said: “If you look at Jeffrey Epstein, if you look at Harvey Weinstein, those types of cases, victims take time to come forward.

“It is hard for them to do.

“These women have gone through several stages of grief and disbelief since they were victimised.

“At first it can be hard to believe that what happened to them actually did, that it was real.

“Then they have to weigh up speaking to the authorities and ask themselves if they think they can be believed.

“They’re intimidated by the profile of the victimiser and the public profile the victimiser has.

“And they don’t want the spotlight on them, or the vitriol that can be directed at them from the supporters and fans of the attacker if they are identified.

“The attacker also has a lot of financial means to pay for lawyers, to pay off officials.

“The Harrises have also made some direct threats to the women over the years.

“A lot of times, these women haven’t told their parents, co-workers, partners, families, their loved ones, their spouses what happened to them.

“These are horrific stories but thankfully the women are now finding the courage to speak about it.”

The body of Julia James, 53, was tragically discovered in Akholt Wood in Snowdown, near Dover - with her loyal dog staying with her body until she was found, neighbours claimed.

Forensic officers today flooded the scene where the mother's body had been found as neighbours paid tribute to the ""bubbly"" woman.

Neighbour Sean Simmonds, 57, a paramedic, said that officers told him Mrs James’s loyal white Jack Russel had stayed with her body after she was killed while on a walk with her beloved pet.

He said: ""The police have been doing door to door knocks. They told us the dog stayed with her. They found the dog with her.""

Locals said Ms James regularly walked her Jack Russell terrier dog, which us believed to be called Toby, along the secluded country footpaths.

The horror happened just two-and-a-half miles from Chillenden, where mum and daughter Lin and Megan Russell, as well as dog Lucy, were murdered in 1996. Lin's older daughter Josie, then nine, suffered horrific injuries but survived the attack.

It is understood PCSO Julia had taken her dog for a walk after working from home.

And Sean added: “She talked about her job lots.

“She was always in a good mood, smiling. She didn’t seem to be under any stress.""

The community was today in shock after the tragic discovery, with local Leah Southwell, 18, saying Julia was always happy.

Leah said: ""She was out walking her dogs at the time of the incident.

""She was so happy. So bubbly, if you were having a bad day she’d be there smiling at you and trying to make you laugh.

""They are the best neighbours you can have.""

She was such a happy woman. She was so happy and bubbly."" Neighbour Leah Southwell

Another neighbour broke down in tears when he paid tribute to grandmother Julia as Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate launched a murder investigation.

He said: “It’s heartbreaking - absolutely tragic. I can’t believe it. She was a loving mum and the pillar of the community.

“This is devastating. She was a lovely woman. A terrific part of the community.

“It was a great comfort having a PCSO there. They’re a lovely family.”

Mrs James had two grown up children - a daughter who also works for the police and a 23-year-old son.

While Kent Police have insisted they are treating the tragedy as a suspicious death, the Major Incident Public Portal, which witnesses can use to submit potentially vital information, described it as a 'murder' codenamed Operation Sark.

National Police Federation chair John Apter tweeted: ""Police have launched a murder investigation after ⁦@kent_police⁩ PCSO Julia James was found dead in remote Snowdown woods. My heart goes out to Julia’s family, friend and her colleagues. This is devastating news.""

Police have not revealed how the popular officer died but a post mortem is due to be held to establish the exact cause of death.

Officers were seen guarding a field alongside Aylesham Road while several more fields were also sealed off with one officer saying it was a ""very big crime scene"".

An aerial image from the scene appears to show a police tent set up next to floodlights in a nearby field.

Police have not revealed how the popular officer died but a post mortem is due to be held to establish the exact cause of death.

Kent Police also refused to say if Mrs James, who is believed to have served in the domestic violence unit, was on duty or off duty when she died.

Mrs James, who lived in Aylesham, Kent, became a PCSO in 2007.

Before joining the force, she worked for Kent County Council in a learning resource centre but wanted to get out and about more.

'SUSPICIOUS' DEATH

After becoming a PCSO for Tenterden in 2013, she said: ""I am a people person and love being in the community. The people in Tenterden are very friendly.""

A Kent Police spokesman said: ""Officers were called shortly after 4pm on Tuesday to Akholt Wood in the Aylesham Road area of Snowdown where the body of a woman, aged 53 was found.

""The victim is a serving Kent Police PCSO Julia James.

""No arrests have been made at this time but detectives from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate are conducting enquiries to establish the circumstances and her death is being treated as suspicious.

""Officers are keen to speak to anyone who was in the area on Monday 26 and Tuesday 27 April who may have seen something unusual or suspicious.""

Dozens of police cars were seen heading to the scene this morning. No arrests have been made at this time.

The victim is a serving Kent Police PCSO Julia James."" Kent Police

Assistant Chief Constable of Kent Police Tom Richards said: ""Officers are carrying out a number of lines of enquiry to establish the circumstances and people in the Snowdown area will see an increased police presence as a result.

""It saddens me to confirm that the victim was a serving PCSO for Kent Police and whilst there is a full and thorough investigation underway our thoughts also remain with her family, friends and colleagues.

""It is vitally important that anyone who was in the area on Monday and Tuesday who may have seen something suspicious gets in touch with us.

""We’re particularly keen to speak to those who regularly visit the area who may have seen something out of place and those who drove by who have dashcam footage.

""We would advise anyone in the area to remain vigilant until the full circumstances of the death are established.""

A spokesman for the Kent Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers within the constabulary, said: ""Very sad news today as Kent Police confirms the death of PCSO Julia James.

The Chillenden murders Julia James' body was found in Snowdown, Kent - just two-and-a-half miles from Chillenden. In 1996, Michael Stone slaughtered Dr Lin Russell, 45, and her six-year-old daughter Megan, along with the family dog. He also tried to kill nine-year-old Josie Russell, who miraculously survived the horror. The family were tied up, blindfolded and attacked with a hammer as they walked in a country lane in the Kent village. Following the horrific incident, Josie and her father Shaun moved to Dyfrryn Nantlle, Gwynedd, Wales Online reported. And Josie has gone on to see great success as an artist. She got engaged in 2018, when she said she hopes to be a mum. Stone's earliest chance of release will be in 2023, when he will be 63. Lawyers acting for him have claimed there is ""compelling evidence"" linking Levi Bellfield to the Russell killings.

The heiress – currently locked up on child grooming charges – saw her sex secrets laid bare after 112 court documents running to thousands of pages were released by a US judge.

They stem from a lawsuit between the socialite and Epstein sex slave Virginia Roberts, who says she was forced to sleep with the Duke of York three times as a teenager – which he denies.

The shocking court documents include testimony that Maxwell and Epstein had sex sessions with strap-ons and dildos.

A former employee claimed Maxwell forced girls into an orgy, according to the court papers.

They also repeat a previous claim that she stole a 15-year-old’s passport to get her to have sex with Epstein.

One document reads: “One witness (redacted) was in tears, as he recounted (Maxwell) bringing a 15-year-old girl into his employer’s home who, in utmost distress, told him that (Maxwell) stole the young girl’s passport and tried to make her have sex with Epstein and then threatened her.

“(Redacted) also testified that he watched Maxwell direct a room full of underage girls to kiss, dance, and touch one another in a sexual way for (Maxwell) and Epstein to watch.

“Another witness (redacted) testified that (Maxwell) recruited her from her school campus to have sex with Epstein with lies about being her personal assistant.”

The court documents also claims that Maxwell tried to smear Virginia, now 36, by alleging that she had an “opioid addiction” and had previously “cried rape” as a teenager.

She is said to have branded Virginia a “professional victim” and “sexually permissive” by digging up police reports involving the American mum-of-three from when she was younger.

Maxwell, 59, is jailed in New York awaiting trial on charges that she procured girls for Epstein’s sex trafficking ring and took part in the abuse.

She denies the charges.

Earlier this week she tried to get the charges dropped, claiming she was protected by Epstein's sweetheart non-prosecution deal in 2007.

Days later James Roberts joked with the boy's mother: ""We should kill a kid more often"" as they lapped up gifts and money from wellwishers.

5 Leon Jayet-Cole had at least 44 injuries including head trauma similar to a car crash victim

5 Stepdad James Roberts beat the five-year-old four times a week after moving in with his mother Emma Jayet

Roberts beat Leon Jayet-Cole and other children in the house up to four times a week after moving in with their mother Emma, a coroner heard.

Their natural father Michael Cole suspected abuse and warned social services.

But a damning coroner's verdict today found social workers, police and health officials failed to stop it.

It came at the end of a long-running inquest that began in 2018 in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Little Leon, who was on the autistic spectrum, died in hospital in May 2015.

A day earlier Roberts called an ambulance claiming he found him pale and not breathing.

He told police he had heard a bang while he was on the phone to Leon's mother and went to check on him a few minutes later.

But a post-mortem revealed 44 injuries, including severe blunt force head trauma, a broken jaw, spinal bleeding and a broken foot.

Doctors told the inquest his head injuries were more typically seen in car crash victims or people who fall from a height above 20 metres (66ft).

5 Social workers and police failed to save Leon Jayet-Cole, a coroner ruled

Police found a fresh hole in the plasterboard in the hall, which was probably made by Leon's head.

Roberts explained it with an unlikely story about ""a dog's bum"" in his police interview and also lied about the cause of his own hand injury.

Detectives suspected him of murder and planted a recording device in the home, the inquest heard.

On June 1, four days after Leon died, Roberts and Emma were heard talking about the gifts and money they had received.

Roberts said the ""new stuff"" was incredible and added: ""We should kill a kid more often.""

He was also recorded saying he and Emma should ""do something cool for the kids"", such as going to Fiji.

Roberts was probably on drugs when he made the admission ""in jest"", said Det Sgt Chris Power.

COVER-UP

Investigators believe Roberts beat the children for three years in a chaotic home environment in which he and his wife regularly used drugs.

Traces of heroin and methamphetamine were found in Leon's hair - indicating he had ingested the drugs in his last months.

Roberts was charged with murder but dodged justice when he died in jail in June 2016 while awaiting trial.

Leon's mother Emma Jayet was accused of lying to police and social workers when she gave evidence to the inquest in 2019.

She said she never saw Roberts hit her children in the three years they lived together, and would have left him if she suspected he might hurt them.

But the coroner heard social workers had twice forced her to take a child to hospital with ""horrific"" bruising after she had refused to seek medical help.

Just days before Leon's fatal head injury he suffered a broken foot caused by stomping.

Emma claimed she didn't notice any swelling and he seemed normal.

In earlier evidence, Leon's dad Michael Cole said he had repeatedly warned social workers the kids were in danger.

He said the children seemed scared of their stepdad and were ""utterly miserable"".

After he filed a complaint to social services, Roberts texted him threatening to kill him and his partner and rape her autistic son.

In a damning verdict, coroner Brigitte Windley ruled police, doctors and child protection staff failed to protect Leon and his siblings.

She said they did not share information or link the mounting evidence of abuse, despite the “enormous resources” devoted to the family.

She said: “The risk of violence in this case went undetected until Leon was killed.""

The coroner was also damning about Leon's mother, ruling that she probably gave false statements to authorities.

She said: “It is difficult to escape the conclusion that Emma knew or suspected that James had been harming the boys, and that from time to time she covered for him.""

And gullible social workers swallowed the lies “when any objective analysis would have indicated that caution and scepticism were required”.

Main suspect in the Suzy Lamplugh case,"MORE than three decades after London estate agent Suzy Lamplugh disappeared, police dug up the garden of the house where prime suspect John Cannan's mum once lived.

Lamplugh, 25, was abducted in 1986 after going to meet a client to show him two houses in Fulham. She was declared dead, presumed murdered, in 1994.

Who is John Cannan?

Cold case detectives named Cannan as the prime suspect of the Lamplugh’s murder in 2002.

However, the Crown Prosecution Service said there was not enough evidence to prosecute Cannan, now 67, who has already been convicted and jailed for a series of crimes.

John Cannan is currently held in Full Sutton prison for the murder of another woman, newlywed Shirley Banks, in 1987.

In 1989 he was convicted of rape, attempted abduction, murder and attempted robbery following a series of crimes against young professional women.

On the evening before his murder of Banks, Cannan had attempted to kidnap another woman, and he was also found to have raped a third at knifepoint in Reading, Berks, a year earlier.

The crimes saw him given three life sentences, and despite originally being given a whole life tariff, this was later reduced to a minimum 35-year sentence.

He had since attempted to appeal the mandatory 35 years, which has been rejected.

Cold case detectives named Cannan as the prime suspect in November 2002 after the Crown Prosecution Service rejected their attempt to charge him, deeming there was insufficient evidence to prosecute.

A fellow prison inmate came forward after the naming, saying that Lamplugh was buried under the patio at Cannan's mother’s house.

Detectives now believe Cannan may have driven to what was then his mother’s home following the suspected murder.

But there were many other clues which suggested Cannan was Mr Kipper long before this tip-off.

An important one was that he was given the nickname “Kipper” by others at a bail hostel where he lived at the time of the murder — due to his fondness for the fish and a habit of having a kip.

What happened to Suzy Lamplugh?

Lamplugh, 25, was abducted in 1986 after going to meet a client named “Mr Kipper” to show him two houses in Fulham.

But, after the mystery house viewing, Lamplugh was never seen again.

Over the decades, police have chased up a number of leads relating to the disappearance, but have continued to draw blanks.

Lamplugh was declared dead, presumed murdered, in 1994.

Are there any other suspects in the Suzy Lamplugh case?

Another suspect in the Suzy Lamplugh case is serial killer Steven Wright - also known as the Suffolk Strangler.

According to reports from Entertainment Daily, Lamplugh worked as a beautician on the ocean liner Queen Elizabeth 2 in 1982.

At the same time Steven Wright was working as a steward.

Steve Wright is a convicted serial killer, the murders taking place over a few months at the end of 2006.

He is known as the Suffolk Strangler and the Ipswich Ripper.

Before his arrest his only criminal activity on record was theft, which is how his DNA was identified in connection with the murders.

Steve Wright had a gambling addiction and was in debt.

Wright’s father, Conrad Wright, told the Mirror he was “troubled” by pictures of Steven Wright with estate agent Suzy, before she vanished in 1986.

The tragic young woman’s devastated family say her legs and ribs were broken as she was tortured during the attack, although officials have not confirmed the injuries.

The woman, who reports claim to be part of the lower-caste Dalit community, had been working at a private firm last Tuesday night.

However, the young woman didn’t return to her home in Balrampur that night.

The injured woman was finally brought home by rickshaw in the early hours of Wednesday morning in a “bad condition” with a drip still pierced into her arm.

Tragically, the young woman died on the way to the hospital.

Balrampur Superintendent of Police Dev Ranjan Verma said two youths named Shahid and Sahil have been arrested for rape and murder.

“We received a complaint in which the kin of the woman informed that she worked at a private firm and on Tuesday she did not return till late night,” he said.

VIOLENT PROTESTS ERUPT

“Later in the wee hours of Wednesday, the girl came on a rickshaw in a bad condition with [a] glucose drip attached to her arms. She was soon rushed to a hospital but died on the way.

“The family members have alleged that two youths raped the girl and took her to some doctor.

""When her condition deteriorated, instead of taking her to a hospital they brought her back to her home.”

Indian police have today imposed emergency laws in the village where a 20-year-old woman as raped and murdered.

DIED FROM SHOCK

Local cops have banned more than five people from gathering after violent protests erupted over the attack.

In the latest case, some 280 miles away, the deputy inspector general of police, Rakesh Singh, said that “shock and haemorrhage” were the cause of death.

“Whether she was sexually assaulted or not will be examined by medical experts,” he added.

India is one of the world’s most dangerous countries for women, with a rape occurring every 15 minutes, according to government figures from 2018.

But campaigners say the issue is far bigger than that, with sexual violence against women hugely under-reported, despite prison sentences for rapists now standing at 20 years.

Members of the Dalit community - formerly known as “untouchables” - are at the bottom of the strict Hindu caste hierarchy in India.

According to human rights organizations, Dalit women are particularly vulnerable to caste-based discrimination and sexual violence.

Last month, a 13-year-old Dalit girl was raped and killed in Uttar Pradesh.

In December last year, a 23-year-old Dalit woman in the same state died after being set ablaze by a gang of men as she made her way to court to press rape charges.

It comes after at least 11 women made abuse allegations against the goth rocker.

Corey posted a photo on Instagram of them together on the evening he claims his ""nightmare"" began more than 20 years ago.

The Goonies star said: “The night @marilynmanson tried 2 use & abuse me as his play toy by trying 2 manipulate me N2 breaking my 5 yrs of sobriety 2 snort cocaine w him, while gaslighting me 4 his press tour on #MechanicalAnimals was where the decades long mental & emotional abuse began.

""Luckily I was not physically harmed that night as we got out safely, but that was just the beginning of my nightmare!

""#ISTANDWITHEVAN & any & all survivors of his demented abuse!""

Actress Evan Rachel Wood's allegations of ""horrific abuse"" by her ex-fiance unleashed a torrent of similar claims by other women this week.

Corey, who has campaigned to expose child abuse in Hollywood, posted in support of Evan and the other accusers.

He added: ""Manson has been obsessed w me 4 over 2 decades! Don’t #BELIEVE me? Just LOOK @ THE PUBLISHED FACTS!

""He 1st wrote several passages about me in his book #LONGROADOUTOFHELL as we had met a few months prior 2 that @ a premier in NY where the #GROOMING process began.

""He grabbed my face in front of the crowd and kissed me w his black lip stick that I couldn’t rub off all night.

""He proceeded 2 gush over me telling me what a 'Huge fan' of mine he was. He then introduced me 2 his BFF #BILLYCORGAN.

""All of this is documented in his book! He brags about it as if I was a special needs person he was making fun of.""

Corey added: ""Manson heavily pursued a friendship w me. Telling me I was his idol.

""Telling me he actually got his whole style by watching my film #DREAMALITTLEDREAM & my character #BOBBYKELLER was the inspiration 4 his entire look.

""Idk if that was #TRUTH but he used it as a way 2 manipulate me.

""Months later he called me on Xmas morning, 2 wish me a 'merry Christmas' & invite 2 a dinner party around the release of his book, @ the fancy Indian Hollywood hang Dar Macrabe where customers sit around on pillows as in traditional Indian style.

""When I walked in the rm it was quite clear that I was the 'guest of honor' as the whole room stopped 2 take pictures of the moment as he hugged me, then grabbed my hand, & led me 2 the table by his side.

""THE PIC IS FROM THAT MOMENT! We later went back 2 his home where the nightmare began. He has messed w my life ever since.""

Manson has not responded to Corey's claims.

Westworld star Evan Rachel Wood, 33, went public last Monday with allegations her ex-fiance tortured and raped her during years of ""horrific abuse"".

Last night she also posted on Instagram, accusing Manson of using racist insults and wearing Nazi tattoos.

At least 11 other women have come forward with similar claims.

Manson was ditched by his record label and also dropped by his manager of 25 years in the wake of the allegations.

He has called the allegations ""horrible distortions of reality"" and insisted all his relationships were consensual.

On Wednesday night police swarmed on his LA mansion for a welfare check after someone inside was reportedly heard screaming.

Corey Feldman has previously detailed the alleged abuse he suffered while working as a child star in 1980s teen movies including Stand By Me, The Goonies and The Lost Boys.

He has spoken of the ""dangerous"" dark underbelly of the industry and claimed there was a powerful ""Hollywood pedophile ring"".

Sarah has not been seen since she left a friend's house in Clapham, South West London, on Wednesday at around 9pm.

“If someone is holding her against her will I would plead with them just to be human and to let her come home, to let her talk to us, give us a ring or text to let us know she is OK,"" said her uncle told The Sun.



“These are desperate times for the family. We know the police are doing everything they can but it's the not knowing what has happened after four days is agonising.”

Sarah's York Uni professor dad Jeremy, her mum, sister Katie and brother James joined the search for the marketing manager in Clapham, south London.

“My brother and sister-in-law are beside themselves with worry,"" said Mr Everard, a building company director and father-of-four who lives in Coventry.

""They’re doing everything they can to help find her and have been walking her last known journey.

'AGONISING'

He described Sarah as a ""bright young woman, very sensible"" who had lived in London ""for a long time so I imagine was very streetwise"".

“She didn't have any troubles and was fit and healthy. She was happy, she had just started a new job and she had a boyfriend,"" he said.



“She is a lovely person. She would never just take time out without contacting her family. It would be completely out of character.



“Her mobile phone is not ringing and she’s not received any WhatsApp messages we’ve been sending her.""

Police have been searching ponds in Clapham Common in a bid to find the missing marketing manager, who should have arrived back home in Brixton shortly before 10pm.

Detectives from the Met's Specialist Crime Command, which deal with homicides and major crime for the force, have now taken over the investigation.

The Met said Sarah's disappearance is still being treated as a missing person's case.

They also said she was last seen on CCTV at around 9.30pm on Poynder's Road heading in the direction of Tulse Hill.

Detective Chief Inspector Katherine Goodwin said: ""I would like to stress that there is no information at this stage to suggest anything untoward may have happened to Sarah.

""The focus remains on returning her home to her family safe and well and that is our number one priority.

""I would like to thank Sarah's family and friends, the local community and members of the public for their help to raise awareness of this appeal and for coming forward with information.

""I would urge anybody who has information or noticed any suspicious activity in the area to contact us if you haven't already. ""

Sarah's family earlier revealed their anguish over the ""out-of-character"" disappearance.

Aunt Jane Everard, of Bolton, Lancs, told The Sun: ""We’re devastated. It is so out of character for her.

“She has a very big circle of friends from Durham, where she was at university and down in London. It has been a real shock. We are all so worried.”

Sarah's uncle Doug revealed the family, who are from York, are now in London as the search continues.

He said Sarah moved to the capital for work around 12 years ago and has a brother and sister who also live in London.

Doug said: “She is lovely, a really lovely young lady, very sensible.

“The police are keeping my brother informed and we are on the end of a phone.

“It is a really tough time. They are devastated and they are desperate to find out anything they can.

“None of us really know anything.

“They have always been a very very close family. Sarah, her parents and her sister and brother, they are all in touch on a regular basis.”

On Wednesday night, Sarah left a friend's house in Leathwaite Road in Clapham about 9pm.

She headed through a back gate onto the A205 South Circular before she is believed to have walked across Clapham Common.

The marketing manager had spoken to her partner on the phone for about 15 minutes, and has not been heard from since that point, according to her friend Rose Woollard.

Police say it is not clear if she made it back to her home in nearby Brixton.

Doug said: “We are devastated. We just want to get her back. We just don’t know where she is.

“She was in touch with her boyfriend on a call and that is the last contact.

“She’s a really bright young girl and we are desperate to find out anything we can. We are sharing as much as we can on social media, really just hoping to hear something.”

The plea comes as police yesterday ramped up the hunt for missing Sarah.

Officers were seen wading through ponds in Clapham Common and searching bins.

Her family said: ""With every day that goes by we are getting more worried about Sarah.

""She is always in regular contact with us and with her friends and it is totally out of character for her to disappear like this. We long to see her and want nothing more than for her to be found safe and well.

""We are so grateful to the police and all our friends for all they are doing. We are desperate for news and if anyone knows anything about what has happened to her, we would urge you to please come forward and speak to the police.

""No piece of information is too insignificant.""

Is it based on a true story?

Sadly yes, Girl in the Basement is based on real events.

Back in 2008, the Josef Fritzl case came to light - he had been keeping his daughter Elisabeth as prisoner in his basement in Amstetten, Austria from just after her 18th birthday.

She was keen to travel at 18, but he locked her away in 1984.

He told anyone that asked she had run away to join a cult and wouldn't be coming back.

Over the years, she suffered extreme sexual abuse.

In total she gave birth to seven children while in the basement. One died in childbirth, three lived in the basement, and three were brought up to the house with Josef pretending they were foundlings.

The truth came out after one of the children became seriously ill and needed to go to hospital.

Josef pled guilty to several charges and is serving a life sentence in Krems-Stein prison.

Rajinder Kalia, 65, allegedly groomed worshippers as young as four for three decades at a temple in Bell Green, Coventry.

It is claimed his loyal fans saw him as “all-powerful, all-seeing and all-knowing” after he claimed to have a “direct link to and regularly speak with God”.

Followers were also allegedly indoctrinated to believe he is an “incarnation of God and or the divine”, reports The Times.

The claims were made in a multimillion-pound civil case filed at the High Court last month after West Midlands Police investigated allegations of sexual abuse.

Four women are seeking damages.

HIGH COURT CASE

They have been joined by a man and a woman, who worked as unpaid servants to Kalia, who claim they lost £1.1million which was handed over to him.

Another woman is seeking £520,000 over similar claims, reports the newspaper.

It is claimed he instructed his followers, who came from as far as Glasgow each week, to use threats of violence against people who spoke out.

One complainant alleged her tyres were slashed while another woman was allegedly threatened with acid attacks and had her “family turned against her”.

'GOD ON EARTH'

He is accused of telling them that people “in the outside world are evil and to be avoided”, adding his followers must “only trust him”.

Worshippers were allegedly persuaded that he is a “healer and miracle worker” with fees costing up to £12,000 per person.

It comes after claims of rape were dropped in 2017 following insufficient evidence and Kalia, a former draper and clerk from India, returned to the temple.

But the new High Court claim, brought by solicitor Clare Kirby from Peacock Law, alleges that sexual abuse amounted to “trespass to the person”.

Robert Aaron Long, 21 - who allegedly gunned down eight people at three different massage parlor locations in Atlanta on March 16 - has been charged over the attack.

One day after a total of eight victims were gunned down - seven were women and six of them were of Asian descent - the Atlanta Police Department shared the first 911 call for the massage parlor shootings.

The first audio, shared to YouTube in a one-minute and 50-second clip, reveals a woman telling a 911 operator to ""please hurry.""

The call came through to 911 at 5.47pm from the woman inside the Gold Spa.

When the woman calling was asked whether she had a description of the male suspect, the caller quietly stated: ""We’re hiding right now, that’s why. They have a gun.""

The witness continued: ""We need an ambulance here... we need police here.""

The caller mentioned multiple times about a robbery in the spa, but when she was questioned the robber's whereabouts, she answered: ""I don’t know.

""I’m hiding right now.""

After being asked what the suspect was wearing, the caller appears to say: ""I don’t know please just come. Ok?""

The second 911 call - which lasted approximately four minutes and came in about 10 minutes after the first call - was from a woman who got a call about the frightening incident at the Aromatherapy Spa.

""I just got a call from one of my friends and they say some guy came in…. and the lady’s passed out,"" the second caller explained. ""Everybody’s scared so they’re hiding.""

She later repeated herself: ""Everybody heard the gunshot and some lady got hurt.""

Following the attacks, the alleged gunman, Long, took responsibility for the shootings and told cops that the massage parlors were a ""temptation that he wanted to eliminate.""

Long was arrested on Tuesday night after leading cops on a three hour car chase, Cherokee County Sheriff's spokesperson Howard J Baker said.

Captain Jay Baker said that Long had been charged with four counts of murder and one count of aggravated assaulted for the Cherokee County shooting, the New York Times reported.

However, charges have not yet been announced in connection with the attacks in the City of Atlanta.

Sheriff Frank Reynolds said in a press conference on Wednesday that Long had potential ""sexual addiction"" issues.

CNN later reported that a former roommate had claimed the alleged shooter spent time in a sex rehab clinic.

Sheriff Reynolds added that cops believe Long ""frequented these places in the past"" and that he ""may have been lashing out.""

They added that Long claimed the attack was not racially motivated.

The Atlanta Police Department added that Long was on his way to Florida, where they believe he was going to ""do similar acts in the state"" targeting ""some type of porn industry.""

Long did not target the victims due to their ethnicity, rather that he chose locations that he ""knew specifically,"" according to Channel 2.

The first shooting occurred at a Cherokee County massage parlor about 30 miles northwest of Atlanta before two other spas across the street from each other in northeast Atlanta were targeted.

Long was only apprehended after authorities performed a pursuit intervention technique (PIT) to stop his vehicle.

The move ""caused the vehicle to spin out of control"" as Long was reportedly driving south on Interstate 75.

He was taken into custody ""without incident"" and was being held at the Crisp County jail.

The suspect is heading back to Cherokee County for a court hearing on Friday morning regarding the slaughters.

The FBI are now assisting the investigation into the shooting spree, that saw six Asian women shot dead.

Of the eight dead, seven were women and one a man, according to officials. Two of the victims were white, cops said.

The Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that the four victims who died at that location were: Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, Paul Andre Michels, 54, Xiaojie Yan, 49 and Daoyou Feng, 44.

They added that one victim who was injured, but is in stable condition, was identified as Elcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz, 30.

Victim Delaina was ""getting a couple's massage with her husband"" when she was shot dead in the massacre.

South Korea have since confirmed that four of the victims were of Korean descent.

Further details have not yet been released on the victims, but Atlanta Police Chief Rodney N. Bryant confirmed the majority were female and Asian.

It is not yet clear if it was a racially motivated attack, but officials from all jurisdictions said they are ""very confident"" that the same suspect was involved in all three shootings.

The first shooting happened at around 5pm at the Youngs Asian Massage Parlor off Bells Ferry Road and Highway 92 in Acworth, Georgia.

Two people died at the scene. A further three were transported to hospital, were another two succumbed to their injuries.

The Sheriff's Office spokesman Captain Jay Baker confirmed that two Asian women, a white woman, a white man, and a Hispanic man had been injured.

Less than an hour later, police responded to a call off a ""robbery in progress"" at Gold Spa, in northeast Atlanta.

Three women were shot dead in the appalling attack.

The gunman then headed to another spa situated just across the street, the Aromatherapy Spa, where officers found another woman deceased.

Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant said all four victims were female, and ""it appears that they may be Asian"".

The Metropolitan Police officers were found to have sent each other disgusting messages where they discussed only helping victims in exchange for sex acts.

2 Officers had messaged about raping and murdering a victim of crime Credit: Alamy

But cop bosses let them off with a warning after a hearing of the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) in November last year.

The three officers' behaviour was assessed as ""misconduct"" and they received written warnings.

An official report published last month revealed one officer said ""he may be arrested for 'rape or murder' of a woman that evening"".

He also suggested to another officer that they arrange to have sex with a victim of crime together the next time they were on night duty, and suggested informing the victim that they would only report her allegation in exchange for a sexual act.

Another cop exchanged text messages with the an officer in which he suggested getting a woman so drunk that she would have sex with them both.

A source said: ""All of these officers could very well still be serving as police officers who are responsible for public protection and safety. This is deeply disturbing.""

The IOPC launched the investigation in January 2018 following a voluntary referral by the Met after phone messages were accidentally disclosed to third parties as part of a separate Surrey Police investigation.

Two other officers were also involved in the investigation for sending a series of text messages which contained offensive references to people with disabilities, sexism, paedophilia, racism and homophobia. They were also given written warnings.

The officers involved were from the Aviation Policing Command, the South West BCU and Specialist Crime North sections of the Metropolitan Police.

It comes after The Sun discovered nearly six hundred Met cops were investigated for sexual harassment in just five years.

'TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE'

Horrifying figures show more than 100 serving officers were accused of sexual harassment, sexual assault or other sexual conduct each year between 2013 and 2018.

And 306 of the 597 complaints came from members of the public.

Commander Paul Betts, of the Met’s Directorate of Professional Standards, said: “The actions of these officers fell well below the standards expected by the Met. That was true in 2009 and is still true now.

""Not only were many of the messages deeply offensive and totally unacceptable, by their very nature they undermine trust and confidence in policing.

“Although this misconduct happened several years ago and the panel had considered the officers’ good service over the past ten years, we will put in place any further learning, development and reflection that may be appropriate to ensure that communities can have confidence in these officers.”

When asked about the 597 complaints, a Met Police spokesman said: ""The Metropolitan Police Service employs more than 40,000 officers and staff, and expects the highest standards from its employees.

""While the allegations involve a small percentage of staff, we acknowledge the impact any offence will have on those involved and will continue to take all allegations of this nature extremely seriously.

""It is clear this type of conduct has no place within the organisation. If standards are proven to have fallen below what is expected, we take appropriate action to ensure both accountability and that lessons are learnt from each case.""

All of these officers could very well still be serving as police officers who are responsible for public protection and safety. This is deeply disturbing. Source

Katie Russell, national spokesperson for Rape Crisis England & Wales said: “It is extremely disturbing that material as misogynistic and sexually violent as this, exchanged between serving police officers about a victim of crime, should be responded to with a written warning alone.

""What recent cases have highlighted is how hateful, sexist and dehumanising attitudes like these towards women are part of a very real continuum of violence against women and girls at the extreme of which is their rape and murder.

""Attitudes like these cannot be tolerated within any criminal justice agency if we’re to stand a hope of justice outcomes improving or more victims and survivors feeling confident to report.

The victim who has not been named was spotted at around 8.40am on Monday as she was being pulled out of a semi-detached house and into a car.

She was reportedly seen being driven away in the white 4 X 4 car which was outside the house in Yarmouth Road, Kirby Cane near Loddon, Norfolk.

Norfolk Police said they responded to reports that a woman “had been seen in distress” and sent patrol cars racing to the area.

The woman was found with serious stab injuries nearly three hours later in Levington Road, Nacton, near Ipswich, Suffolk.

She was flown by air ambulance to Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, and was thought to be fighting for life.

Norfolk Police said today that she remained in hospital with serious injuries and was in a stable condition.

A man, aged in his 30s, was arrested on suspicion of her attempted murder and initially taken to the Police Investigation Centre at Martlesham near Ipswich.

But it was revealed today that he had been moved to the Police Investigation Centre at Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, where he is being quizzed by detectives.

A villager in Kirby Cane who asked not to be named said: “My 18-year-old daughter was driving to school when she saw a woman being dragged out of the house by a man.

“She was kicking and screaming as she was being pulled by her arms. She clearly didn’t want to go into the car and was put in there by force.

“My daughter turned around to have a look and saw her sitting in the passenger seat as she was driven away.”

Norfolk Police confirmed that the woman had been seen “being driven away from the address”.

Other villagers said they later saw up to nine police cars in Yarmouth Road as officers appeared to start a search for the woman.

Forensic officers were later seen going into the house in a search for clues.

The house remained cordoned off with blue and white police tape today (tues) as police stood guard outside.

Officers also closed the quiet country lane where the woman was found in Nacton which is known as a beauty spot beside the River Orwell.

Detective Inspector Tom Smith, from Norfolk Police, said: ""Our enquiries are continuing to establish the events leading up to the woman sustaining her injuries. However, we do believe those involved are known to each other.""

Residents said they believed the woman had been found in a lay-by beside a blocked off field entrance on the outskirts of the village, around 300 yards from the nearest house.

One villager said she heard the air ambulance helicopter landing in a nearby field to pick up the seriously injured woman.

Sim Beckley who lives in Nacton near where the woman was found said: ""You don't think of this in a sleepy village like this do you?

""I guessed it was something serious as I could see emergency services flying about. I hope the girl is alright.

""You don't expect this down here, more up Manchester and London and all that. Not down here. I'm shocked, more than anything.""

A 22-year-old psychology graduate, who was with the teenager in Ayia Napa on the night of the attack, said an investigating officer re-wrote her witness statement to make it look like the pair had been drinking heavily earlier.

She said: “When I saw my statement in court I couldn’t believe it. No way was it what I had written.”

And the 19-year-old teen’s lawyer told The Sun a close examination of the language used in her statement retracting her rape allegation suggested it was not in her words.

Forensic linguistic specialist Dr Andrea Nini said: “The linguistic evidence supports the hypothesis that all or some parts of the statement were not composed by the girl.

“They were from a non-native English speaker. The combination of words is not what an educated English speaker would say or write.

“What it appears to be is words dictated to her by someone else who didn’t speak English as their first language.” The confession reads:

“The report I did on the 17th of July 2019 that I was raped at Ayia Napa was not the truth. The truth is that I wasnt raped and everything that happened in that appartment was with my consent.

'WRITTEN IN GREEKLISH'

“The reason I made the statement with the fake report is because I did not know they were recording & humiliating me that night I discovered them recording me doing sexual intercourse and I felt embarrassed so I want to appologise, say I made a mistake.”

Dr Nini said: “It is very unlikely a native English speaker would write ‘report I did’ — it would be ‘the report I made.’

“Also an English speaker is more likely to say ‘not true’ rather than ‘not the truth’.

“The statement also contains the word apartment which is misspelt with an extra p and is more American than English. ‘Discovered them’ is also not a native English speaker’s phrase.

“It’s more consistent with a person who has English as a second language.

“Perhaps the most telling is the use of the phrase ‘doing sexual intercourse’ — a native English speaker would say ‘having sexual intercourse’.”

10

Five phrases language expert doubts were victim's 'The report I did on the 17th of July' - an English speaker would more likely say the 'report I made' '[The report was] Not the truth' - Dr Nini says the phrase is 'grammatical' but a native speaker would say 'not true' 'Appartment (spelled incorrectly)' - The use of the Americanism is not consistent with the teen's middle-class background and budding university education. She would be more likely to use the word 'flat' 'I discovered them' - Dr Nini says this phrase is 'not consistent' with a native English speaker and more likely to be used by someone who speaks it as a second language 'Doing sexual intercourse' - an English speaker is far more likely to say 'having sexual intercourse'

The 19-year-old’s conviction on Monday rests on the validity of the retraction statement, which she is said to have written and signed ten days after the rape.

But Dr Nini’s analysis bolsters the well-educated teenager’s claim that the many grammatical errors and spelling mistakes prove it was not written by her.

Her lawyer Michael Polak said the statement was written in “Greeklish”.

And he insists it was given under duress after almost eight hours of hostile questioning and with no lawyer or translator present — a breach of her human rights.

The teenager’s friend, who comforted her as she sobbed and told of the hotel room rape by 12 Israelis, today insisted the Cypriot police never had any intention of taking them seriously.

'WEREN'T TAKEN SERIOUSLY'

She added: “It was a stitch-up from the beginning. It felt as if they had made their minds up without even bothering to listen to us.

""We weren’t taken at all seriously and it felt as if we were being kept in the dark the whole time.”

She told of her shock at the way in which her witness statement was taken by an investigating officer.

The 22-year-old, who had been out for a meal with the teenager earlier, added: “There was just me and him in the room and he kept saying to me ‘So you were both drinking a bit that night?’

“He was implying that we were drunk and I said that wasn’t the case. He was trying to suggest that it was all our fault because we were drunk. But we weren’t. He was writing my statement as he wanted to interpret it.”

10 Judge Michalis Papathanasiou triggered outrage both in the UK and in Cyprus with his guilty verdict

Police initially arrested 12 Israeli men aged between 16 and 19 in connection with the attack.

But all were later released without charge and allowed home.

Police say the teenager invented the rape claim after discovering film of her having consensual sex with one of the Israelis had been posted online.

The teenager had started seeing the Israeli a few days earlier and had gone to a hotel room with him after having a meal with her friend.

During her trial she told the court they had sex but she asked him to stop when he became violent.

Orgy 'a fantasy' A HUMAN rights lawyer has slammed the conviction and said the idea the teen willingly took part in an orgy is a “ridiculous porn fantasy”. Harriet Wistrich, of the Centre for Women’s Justice, said: “I’ve never met a woman who’d consent to (sex with 12 men). ""I believe she had sex with one then was treated appallingly by his friends. ""As I understand there is video evidence of her asking the men to leave the room then they posted what they filmed online, which is particularly offensive. ""There appears to be a lot of material available. “She confessed under duress. To me the conviction is unsafe. “It’s also tortuous for her having the judge drag it out for so long. I don’t understand his motive.”

The girl, from Derbyshire, was found guilty of public mischief earlier this week and faces a jail sentence of up to a year and a maximum £1,450 fine when she is sentenced on Tuesday.

Yesterday we told how the teenager and her mother called on Boris Johnson to personally intervene to put an end to her suffering before she is sentenced.

They flocked to Twitter to comment on the shock nookie in the middle of the psychological crime drama on ITV tonight.

The twisted tale depicts Connie as a masterful manipulator, unearthing Emma's past traumas and pains.

Under Kay's Law, victims of domestic abuse will be able to get the suspect barred from places they used to go together if they fear they might turn up there.

Such places could include pubs, clubs and restaurants, school gates or even homes of relatives and friends, the Sunday People report.

The law has been named after Kay Richardson, 49, who was killed in 2018 by husband Alan Martin, 53, after accusing him of rape.

Martin strangled his estranged wife after police gave him back his keys to their house, an inquest heard in August 2019.

The aim of ""Kay’s Law"" is to protect women from violent ex-partners and those who face charges of violent or sexual abuse and stalking but have been released on bail.

It also seeks to increase jail terms for sex offenders.

The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill will stop serious sexual and violent offenders doing only half the sentence and they will have to serve at least two-thirds.

The new measure will also give victims of domestic abuse greater protection, forcing officers to bring in tougher bail conditions.

Karen Ingala Smith, chief executive of domestic violence charity Nia, told the People: “Rape and domestic abuse ­prosecutions are falling and good laws are worthless if they fail in implementation.”

HOW YOU CAN GET HELP: Women's Aid has this advice for victims and their families: Always keep your phone nearby.

Get in touch with charities for help, including the Women’s Aid live chat helpline and services such as SupportLine.

If you are in danger, call 999.

Familiarise yourself with the Silent Solution, reporting abuse without speaking down the phone, instead dialing “55”.

Always keep some money on you, including change for a pay phone or bus fare.

If you suspect your partner is about to attack you, try to go to a lower-risk area of the house – for example, where there is a way out and access to a telephone.

Avoid the kitchen and garage, where there are likely to be knives or other weapons. Avoid rooms where you might become trapped, such as the bathroom, or where you might be shut into a cupboard or other small space. If you are a ­victim of domestic abuse, SupportLine is open Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 6pm to 8pm on 01708 765200. The charity’s email support ­service is open weekdays and weekends during the crisis – messageinfo@supportline.org.uk. Women’s Aid provides a live chat service available. from 10am to noon. You can also call the freephone 24-hour ­National Domestic Abuse Helpline on 0808 2000 247.

Zoe Dronfield, 41, who survived a brutal attack by her serial stalker boyfriend, said: “Obviously all these things are great, they put more stipulations around the ­offenders and aim to keep the victims safe.

""Victims go back to abusers ­because they can’t get away. This seems to be about keeping the abuser away, which is a good thing.”

The Bill comes amid fears of safety for women after Sarah Everard’s killing.

In a statement offering condolences to the family Priti Patel said: ""Every single one of us can relate to them.

""Too many of us have worked home from work alone, only to hear footsteps following closely behind us.

""Too many of us have pretended to be on the phone to a friend to scare someone off.

""Too many of us have clutched our keys in our fist in case we need to defend ourselves and that is not ok.""

The 34-year-old - real name Stefani Germanotta - burst on to the scene in 2007 with smash hits Just Dance and Poker Face, but behind the scenes was a young woman battling eating disorders, drug addiction, family loss, and sexual assault.

Now, she has been faced with the shocking moment her dog walker was shot by bulldog thieves.

Ryan Fischer was walking the superstar's pooches, Koji, Miss Asia and Gustavo, just before 10pm on Wednesday night when the incident occurred.

Both Koji and Gustavo were stolen, but Miss Asia got away and was later recovered by cops; Gaga is now offering $500,000 for the return of her beloved pets, ""no questions asked,"" according to TMZ - although it may be jeopardizing the investigation.

It comes less than a year after Gaga admitted that fame led to her ""feeling suicidal,"" and that despite the fans and the acclaim, she ""didn't really understand why I should live.""

She told CBS in 2020.""I hated being famous. I hated being a star.

""I felt exhausted and used up. I didn't really understand why I should live other than to be there for my family. That was an actual real thought and feeling: 'Why should I stick around?'""

Born in 1986 in New York, Gaga always wanted to perform and enrolled in ballet lessons.

But by the age of 15 she was battling the eating disorders bulimia and anorexia, admitting in 2012 that she ""used to throw up all the time in high school.""

""I wanted to be a skinny little ballerina but I was a voluptuous little Italian girl whose dad had meatballs on the table every night,"" she said, at a conference called It’s Our Turn.

Her father had himself had a tough childhood, seeing his older sister Joanne die at the age of 18 in 1974 when he was just 16.

Gaga has the date of her Aunt Joanne’s death tattooed on her arm, and the Upper West Side restaurant Joe, which opened in 2012, is also named after her.

Joanne died of lupus, and in 2010 Gaga revealed that tests had her as ""borderline positive"" for the disease, meaning she will need to keep an eye on her symptoms for the rest of her life.

Gaga, however, also has fibromyalgia, and in September 2017 she was hospitalized due to “severe pain” and forced to cancel tour dates.

14 She later revealed she had fibromyalgia

“I get so irritated with people who don’t believe fibromyalgia is real,” the singer said in 2018 to Vogue.

She added: “For me, and I think for many others, it’s really a cyclone of anxiety, depression, PTSD, trauma, and panic disorder, all of which sends the nervous system into overdrive, and then you have nerve pain as a result.""

But as her fame grew, Gaga turned more to drugs, snorting cocaine on her own ""in my apartment while I wrote music.""

Speaking radio station Z100 she said: “I was living on a totally other psychedelic plane, numbing myself completely, and looking back I do see now that some of it had to do with my hip pain.

""I didn’t know where the pain was coming from so I was just in a lot of pain and very depressed all the time and not really sure why.”

The pop star added that fame had led to her relying on illegal substances, admitting: “I’ve been addicted to various things since I was young. Most heavily over the past seven year. But, the truth is that it is very hard to be famous.""

""It's very lonely being a performer,"" Gaga shared in 2018 with the LA Times. ""There's a certain loneliness that I feel, anyway — that I'm the only one that does what I do. So, it feels like no one understands. And the urge to use is because you're searching for a way to quell the pain.""

Gaga found fame lonely - and close friend Tony Bennett wrote in his book Just Getting Started that ""there were people who pretended to be her friends, but mostly wanted to attach themselves to her trajectory into the stars — and her money.""

In her 2017 Netflix documentary she also spoke of her love life, and how fame had led to it ""imploding.""

""I sold 10 million [records] and lost Matt [Michael Williams]. I sold 30 million and lost Luc [Carl]. I did a movie and lost Taylor [Kinney]. It's like a turnover.""

In October 2018, Gaga announced her engagement to talent agent Christian Carino whom she had met in early 2017, but four months later they ended the engagement.

Gaga is now dating entrepreneur Michael Polansky.

In 2016, Gaga movingly opened up on the sexual assault she faced as a teeanger, after she penned the Oscar-nominated track Til It Happens To You for the feature documentary The Hunting Ground, a film about sexual assaults on American college campuses.

At a TimesTalks panel, Gaga revealed she had been assaulted at age 19 by a man 20 years her senior, but “didn’t want to be defined by it.”

She said: ""I didn't tell anyone for, I think, seven years.

""I didn't know how to think about it. I didn't know how to accept it. I didn't know how not to blame myself, or think it was my fault. It was something that really changed my life. It changed who I was completely.""

Gaga went on to add that she thought she had ""brought it on myself in some way,” because of the way she dressed, and added that the physical consequences of the rape were just as painful as the emotional.

Gaga shared: ""When you go through a trauma like that, it doesn't just have the immediate physical ramifications on you.

The 22-year-old was kidnapped in Karachi's Clifton, Pakistan yesterday at 9.30pm and was taken to an apartment where she was assaulted, police said.

2 The woman, 22, was waiting for her bus home when she was allegedly abducted and raped in an apartment

She is reported to have described how three men in a car abducted her while she waited for a bus to go home.

According to police, after she was raped, the men then dropped her back at the same spot she had been kidnapped from, leaving the her to find her way home.

The victim filed a report a day after the incident, police said.

They also said the woman was sent to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre where medical examinations confirmed that she had been sexually assaulted.

Two men have been accused of carrying out the assault while a third is wanted for facilitating them.

The victim and her family have requested to remain anonymous, according to police.

They said: “The woman has identified influential suspects”.

They vowed the suspects will soon be caught.

The attack comes days after Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan called for rapists and child molesters to be chemically castrated.

He told 92 News he had discussed the issue with members of his cabinet when asked about a rape case which had gripped the country.

He said: “I think he (the rapist) should be hanged publicly”.

After acknowledging that public hangings would be frowned upon by the international community, he said people who commit the crimes should “undergo chemical castration, or surgery be performed so they cannot do anything in future”.

Crimes against women are ­reassuringly rare in that part of the world and always severely punished.

I never worried about her over there.

But if she had chosen to do the same thing in London, Glasgow, Birmingham or Dundee, or indeed any of our major towns and cities, I would have been out of my mind with stress and anxiety.

The appalling killing of Sarah Everard — who vanished while walking home from a friend’s house in London on March 3 — has made us all think about the safety of our mothers, daughters, sisters, nieces and friends, especially during the hours of darkness.

It has resulted in so many women ­sharing their sickening stories of being groped, pawed on public transport, having men expose themselves in public parks and being seriously sexually assaulted.

For many of these women, it was something they felt simply had to be endured and coped with in the best way they could.

It makes me livid. No woman should feel cowed into changing her behaviour or the clothes she chooses to wear because an attacker might be lurking in the ­shadows.

MAKES ME LIVID

When I lived in central London I used to walk home all the time, but I was always alert to any possibility of ­danger.

I kept to the busy main roads, had my keys in my pockets and my eyes and ears alert at all times.

I always carried a big handbag so I could change from my high heels into my trainers to walk quickly and be able to run away from danger.

I certainly didn’t live my life in a state of fear and terror, and taking these measures was a force of habit to protect myself.

But what an indictment on our world that for me and so many other women, this is the norm.

Back in the Seventies I vividly remember the Reclaim The Night marches at a time when women were being told to stay indoors and not to wear “provocative” clothing, as though being raped and attacked was somehow their fault not the perpetrator’s.

13 I cannot begin to imagine what Sarah’s parents and family are going through and I cannot believe we are back here again Credit: PA:Press Association

A similar thing happened ­during the botched investigation into the Yorkshire Ripper, with exhausted women taking to the streets to demand the right to live their lives without fear.

To my mind, the crime has always been looked at through the wrong end of the lens, and it’s a scandal this is still the case.

This weekend in London there will be a socially distanced Reclaim These Streets vigil to remember Sarah and to demand the streets be made safe for women.

I cannot begin to imagine what Sarah’s parents and family are going through and I cannot believe we are back here again.

Although he could be exasperating and annoying, Piers was also a very loyal and steadfast person behind the scenes.

I will miss his rants, his shameless name-dropping and his terrier-like pursuit of Govern­ment ministers.

Think of lost lives

TODAY marks exactly a quarter of a century since the world was shocked by the murder of 16 little schoolchildren and their teacher in Dunblane Primary School.

We should all take a moment to remember those who were killed, as well as the children who were badly wounded and left physically and mentally scarred.

The parents whose children were gunned down will never forget what happened, but have somehow learned to live with unimaginable loss.

Today, in their own way, they will be reflecting on those terrible events of 25 years ago.

Due to the Covid restrictions, even a small gathering of the bereaved is not possible, but they will all be thinking of each other as they have a common bond of intense suffering.

I hope that they can feel a sense of comfort at the extraordinary achievement of changing the law to ban handguns.

TERRIBLE COST

That legal change came at a terrible cost, but the brave campaigners were determined no other parent would go through such torment.

I often think of the deep symbolism at the memorial service held in Dunblane Cathedral six months afterwards.

I read out a poem chosen by the parents and each of them lit a candle bearing the name of their child.

It was extremely moving. These tiny flames were beacons of hope and a small, bright light amid the darkness.

That sense of hope still resonates with all of us.

The community has come together. The parents and families have somehow rebuilt their lives.

It is a place buzzing with activities, and where you can hear children laughing.

I’d like to thank all of you for your comments about the documentary I fronted on Thursday, and all those who trusted me with their stories.

At some point today, take a moment to think of Dunblane and the efforts that were made so all our children can be kept safe.

Science fiction becomes science fact

WHAT we used to think of as science fiction is becoming science fact.

Mobile phones, video calls, vaccines for vile viruses – and now a pill you swallow with a tiny camera inside that can take images of your innards.

It should detect cancer far quicker than an endoscopy and patients might even get a diagnosis within hours.

Instead of a potentially uncomfortable procedure, you can now just take the capsule and get on with your life while it processes all of the information.

It reminded me of 1966 sci-fi movie Fantastic Voyage, where a brilliant scientist fighting a brain tumour invents a way to miniaturise a submarine manned by doctors and shrink them to be small enough to be injected into his body.

A teeny weeny Raquel Welch is one of the medics and I remember scoffing at the silliness of it all – but here we are.

Obviously we are not shrinking glamour pusses and swallowing them whole yet. But this really is exciting stuff.

And to answer your questions . . .

Yes, you poo it out.

And no, it is not reusable.

He has been on TV this week investigating ways to keep looking young and beautiful without resorting to plastic surgery, which has a disquieting habit of making everyone look like Daffy Duck caught in a wind tunnel.

His findings were packed with common sense.

You need to eat well, do a bit of exercise, drink sensibly and don’t go on the lash every weekend. Above all, do not smoke.

Of all the things you can do to help your health and happiness, stubbing out the ciggies has to be No1.

Smoking ages the skin, discolours your hair, makes your breath stink and gives you a mouth like a cat’s bum.

It’s a no-brainer. Listen to Martin.

The driver was giving evidence at the start of the high-profile trial of Hakan Aysal, 40, who is accused of murdering Semra Aysal, 32, at a picturesque beauty spot in Turkey.

The couple had been on holiday in Butterfly Valley, in the district of Fethiye, Mugla Province, when the shocking death happened in June 2018.

Sait Erturk, the motorist who was flagged down by the defendant shortly after Semra plunged over the cliff, told the court he was surprised at his apparent lack of concern.

He said: ""I was driving there when I saw someone was waving at me, and I stopped.

""Hakan came and said his wife had fallen down the cliff. We immediately got out of the car and started looking for her, but we couldn't see where she would have landed from where we were.""

He added: ""We tried to get closer to the edge for a better look. Hakan did not come with us down there.

""We stayed there until the gendarmerie arrived. Hakan was very carefree and calm. He was not acting like a man whose wife just had fallen off a cliff.""

Another witness, Recep Sahin told the court: “I stopped there to see the view of Kabak Bay with my family.

“My daughter was filming the view with my phone and the Aysal couple came down the slope at that moment.

“We even joked, ‘either this man will throw the woman off or the woman will throw the man’”.

In the indictment for 'deliberate murder' it states Hakan ""planned the murder of his wife by first taking out a personal accident insurance on her behalf with a guarantee of TRY 400,000 (£40,865) and where the only beneficiary was himself.""

The indictment also noted that Hakan claimed the insurance payment a short while later, but it was declined when the investigation into the death was announced.

In a video interview, the court heard from the wife’s brother, Naim Yolcu, who said: ""When we went to the Forensic Medicine Institute to get the body, Hakan was sitting in the car.

""My family and I were destroyed, but Hakan did not even appear sad.""

He added: ""My sister was always against taking out loans. However, after she died, we learned that she had loans taken out by Hakan on behalf of my sister.""

Local news outlet NTV reported that in the reports requested by the court from the banks, it was stated that Semra had a total of seven loans taken out in her name.

Asked about the insurance premiums, Hakan said: ""I have been interested in extreme sports since 2014; parachute, bungee jumping, rafting. That is why I had life insurance before I got married.""

Hakan was also asked about the paragrpah in the accident personal insurance stating that ""in case Semra Aysal dies, her heir will be her husband Hakan Aysal.""

He said: ""I did not examine the policy much. The banker arranged the paperwork. I just brought it to my wife to get it signed. I was not aware that there was such an article.""

He has denied being responsible for her death, saying: ""After taking a photo, my wife put the phone in her bag.

""Later she asked me to give her the phone. I got up and then heard my wife scream behind me when I walked a few steps away to get the phone from her bag.

""When I turned back, she was not there. I did not push my wife.""

During this week's hearing at Fethiye High Criminal Court, Hakan was absent due to being quarantined for Covid-19.

Local media claims the incident took place at a holiday apartment in Piazza Sant’Oronzo in the city of Lecce in the southern Italian region of Apulia.

The British tourist called the emergency services, telling them she wanted to jump off the balcony, according to Italian newspaper Leggo.

According to media reports in the country, the girl said she was raped by three men while holidaying in Italy.

The alleged rape took place during the night at another house in an unspecified part of the region.

She was out with a friend in the local town, but at some point became separated.

She then met a group of people and spent the rest of the evening with them - eventually going to an unidentified apartment at the end of the night where the alleged incident took place.

YOU ARE NOT ALONE EVERY 90 minutes in the UK a life is lost to suicide. It doesn't discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society - from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers. It's the biggest killer of people under the age of 35, more deadly than cancer and car crashes. And men are three times more likely to take their own life than women. Yet it's rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now. That is why The Sun launched the You're Not Alone campaign. The aim is that by sharing practical advice, raising awareness and breaking down the barriers people face when talking about their mental health, we can all do our bit to help save lives.

Reports say the following morning police responded after the woman became extremely distressed, with people in nearby buildings hearing her screams.

Officers reportedly arrived at the property at around 7am, and the tourist was transferred to a local hospital for examination.

The investigation is ongoing.

The allegation comes after two British teenagers say they were gang-raped by an eight-strong gang who gatecrashed a birthday party at a luxury villa in Italy.

Cops say their drinks were spiked and have described the attack as ''brutal and extreme'' with four men now in custody, three on bail and another being hunted.

Speaking from his lawyer's office in Pisticci, where the attack happened, one of the alleged victim's 55-year-old dad, described the moment he saw here when he flew to be beside her.

He told The Sun Online: ""She used to have a smile brighter than the stars. Now she no longer has it.''

The girls have told cops they were dragged into bushes during their ordeal which lasted 15 minutes before the men ran off - with one of the girls even biting the private parts of one of the attackers.

Former Liberian president Charles Taylor reckons he is at greater risk of catching it because his prison is overcrowded and he hasn’t been given a mask.

And the brutal ex-rebel leader – found guilty of murder, rape and recruiting child soldiers – is pleading to be sent to a “safe third country” to continue his sentence.

Taylor, 72, ended up in Durham’s Frankland Prison after the UK government agreed to take him when he was convicted in 2012.

He is serving his sentence alongside criminals such as Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe, Soham killer Ian Huntley and Milly Dowler murderer Levi Bellfield.

He reckons the top security jail poses a high risk of catching coronavirus so he applied to the International Criminal Court in the Hague to request a move abroad.

His lawyer Essa Faal said: “Mr Taylor has not been provided with adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and masks and has no statistics on whether that prison facility has sufficient hand washing areas and isolation rooms for all its 900 inmates.”

Taylor reckons the health crisis means the UN rule that “no one in prison should fear for his or her physical safety"" is not being met.

His application added: “A substantial number of inmates in prisons and detention centres across the United Kingdom are reported to have contracted the disease"" and people in overcrowded areas and older persons are ""among the highest and most vulnerable categories to the disease.""

He added that he was ""extremely concerned about his physical safety and his health in general in light of the current widespread nature of the coronavirus situation in the UK"".

And he said his fears of contracting it have been ""aggravated after it was confirmed that two of the prison inmates in HM Frankland Prison have been infected"" and there have been ""reports of deaths of prison inmates in prison/detention centres across the UK.”

A transfer is necessary to “avert a looming disaster on his life if he were to contract the Coronavirus”, it was said.

The court was told that Frankland actually has an operational capacity of 854 with a current population of 840.

All prisoners, including Taylor, are in single cells.

His application, filed in June, was dismissed by a judge, Justice Teresa Doherty, earlier this month.

She said: “Request for a transfer demonstrates a woeful lack of grasp of the reality the world community faces from the threat of COVID-19.”

She added that the ""World Health Organisation has not declared any place in the world safe from COVID-19.”

It is not known if Taylor will try and appeal the ruling.

The former Liberian rebel leader was convicted of war crimes for helping to fuel the civil war in neighbouring Sierra Leone.

In return for blood diamonds he gave weapons to rebel groups who specialised in hacking the arms and legs off victims in an 11-year conflict that left 50,000 dead.

The judge at his trial said he was guilty of some of “the most heinous and brutal crimes recorded in human history"".

Rebels supported by Taylor forced a woman to carry a bag of human heads that included those of her children while another had her eyes pulled out after a gang rape to prevent her from identifying her attackers.

His men also cut open pregnant women to settle bets as to the sex of their unborn child.

At his trial it was said that Taylor gave blood diamonds to supermodel Naomi Campbell after a dinner party they both attended.

She denied knowing the stones came from Taylor.

The Ministry of Justice said there were currently no cases among prisoners at Frankland although three members of staff had tested positive this month and were now self-isolating.

A Prison Service spokesperson said: “The court refused Charles Taylor’s application.

Bianco was one of the many women, including actress Evan Rachel Wood, who spoke out against the shock rocker.

The performer - whose real name is Brian Hugh Warner - called the accusations frivolous through his attorney Howard E. King.

“These claims are provably false,” King said in a statement first reported by Deadline Hollywood.

“To be clear, this suit was only filed after my client refused to be shaken down by Ms. Bianco and her lawyer and give in to their outrageous financial demands based on conduct that simply never occurred. We will vigorously contest these allegations in court and are confident that we will prevail.

Manson has been on his heels since the scandal over his behavior with women started swirling back in February.

On Friday, the 38-year-old actress filed a lawsuit in the Los Angeles federal court where she claimed Warner raped and sexually battered her.

""Mr. Warner used drugs, force, and threats of force to coerce sexual acts from Ms. Bianco on multiple occasions,” the papers say.

“Mr. Warner raped Ms. Bianco in or around May 2011.”

It further claimed that Manson “committed sexual acts” with Bianco at times when she was unconscious or unable to consent, and lists the ways she claims he sexually battered her.

“These acts include spanking, biting, cutting, and whipping Ms. Bianco’s buttocks, breasts, and genitals for Mr. Warner’s sexual gratification – all without the consent of Plaintiff,"" it states.

The incoming of accusations rattled some in Manson's inner circle.

Tony Ciulla, who managed Manson for more than 25 years, cut ties after many women came forward accusing rocker and actor of sexually and physically abusing them.

According to the lawsuit, the hitmaker is also being accused of committing human trafficking when he “employed fraud” in bringing Bianco to the United States to appear in a music video for his song I Want to Kill You Like They Do in the Movies and a never-made horror film based on the works of Lewis Carroll called Phantasmagoria.

“He promised work opportunities that never appeared while inserting himself in her visa process,” according to the complaint.

Manson allegedly “[directed] Ms. Bianco to draft paperwork to confirm that she would star in his upcoming film.”

The filing added: “By inserting himself in Ms. Bianco’s visa process, Mr. Warner was able to control Ms. Bianco by threatening to withdraw support if she displeased him.”

She claimed that, during one incident, Manson prevented her from leaving by locking her in a bedroom.

Bianco also alleged he forced her to perform “unpaid labor.""

The lawsuit claimed: ""This included serving and preparing food for Mr. Warner and his guests, cleaning his apartment, consulting on his album, providing uncredited backup vocals during the creative process for the album Born Villain, and being offered up to his guests and bandmates to ‘spank.'

“Mr. Warner implied that because he had brought Ms. Bianco to the United States and provided housing, she owed him labor and sexual intimacy.”

Soon after filing the court papers, Bianco tweeted a statement: “As millions of survivors like myself are painfully aware, our legal system is far from perfect.

""This is why I co-created the Phoenix Act, a law which gives precious additional healing time to thousands of domestic violence survivors.

“But while I fight for a more just legal system, I am also pursuing my right to demand my abuser be held to account, using every avenue available to me.

“For far too long, my abuser has been left unchecked, enabled by money, fame and an industry that turned a blind eye.""

She added: “Despite the numerous brave women who have spoken out against Marilyn Manson, countless survivors remain silenced, and some of their voices will never be heard.

""My hope is that by raising mine, I will help to stop Brian Warner from shattering any more lives and empower other victims to seek their own small measure of justice.”

She further claimed that Manson plied her with a regimen of drugs and deprived her of food and sleep to break down her defenses.

According to the lawsuit, this was “in order to weaken her physically and mentally and decrease her ability to refuse him.”

The actress is seeking unspecified damages for the abuse she claimed she suffered.

Manson is already being probed the LA Sheriff’s Office for an array of domestic abuse claims stemming from at least 11 women.

Bianco claimed that Manson's former manager Tony Ciulla and his Ciulla Management company are also culpable in the behavior because they profited from “allowing this abuse to continue.”

She also claimed that Ciulla Management was aware of the way the singer's assistant would serve as a “babysitter” when the singer wasn’t around.

The suit claimed that “Mr. Warner’s former assistants discussed Mr. Warner’s abuse directly with Mr. Ciulla.

""Mr. Warner’s management had a vested interest in supporting his violent tendencies to encourage the creation of his ‘art’ and the promotion of the brand of Marilyn Manson, and were complicit in Mr. Warner’s abuse of Ms. Bianco.”

As for how their history began, Bianco claimed in the lawsuit that she had been fooled into thinking that she was there for a music video after Manson and Dita Von Teese divorced in 2007.

“Upon arrival, Ms. Bianco found that there was no crew present and that she was expected to stay at Mr. Warner’s home rather than in the hotel that had been previously booked,” the lawsuit claimed.

It further claimed she has not given her food for the four-day shoot and instead was paid with alcohol and drugs.

The singer would allegedly make her wear lingerie the entire time, and not allow her to sleep and to be on call 24 hours a day.

During the shoot, Bianco claimed Manson acted erratically, breaking his camera at one point in a fit of anger.

She claimed he made her watch a movie so violent that she fainted and that he tried to force her to perform sexual acts with another woman on camera.

“Perhaps most horrifyingly, Mr. Warner locked Ms. Bianco in the bedroom, tied her to a prayer kneeler, and beat her with a whip that Mr. Warner said was utilized by the Nazis,” the lawsuit claimed.

“He also electrocuted her.”

Then, in May 2009, Manson allegedly flew to London and he and Bianco began a consensual sexual relationship.

14 She claimed he would grope her in public without her consent Credit: Redferns

However, he would allegedly grope her in public without her consent and made her follow a dress code.

“[He] forced her to sit at his feet during press visits,” the filing claimed. “He verbally degraded her during interviews. He also attempted to bring a minor back to the hotel with him and Ms. Bianco.”

They kept up a long-distance relationship until April 2011, when he asked Bianco to move to Los Angeles and said he would secure her a visa, according to the filing.

She lived with him for just two and a half months after moving in together.

It was then, she claimed, that he threatened her visa status, kept her prisoner in his apartment, and locked her in a closet.

“On one occasion, Mr. Warner chased Plaintiff around the apartment with an ax, smashing holes in the walls,” the lawsuit claimed.

“On another occasion, Mr. Warner cut Ms. Bianco with a Nazi knife during sex, without her consent, and photographed the cuts on her body. He then posted the photos online without her consent. Mr. Warner’s friends, bandmates, assistant, producer, and other colleagues witnessed various aspects of this abuse — including Mr. Ciulla.”

She escaped one day in June 2011, the lawsuit claimed, when Manson was sleeping.

They saw each other again two years later after one of Warner’s concerts. She met him on his bus afterward where he “forcibly kissed her without her consent and attempted to block her from leaving,” the filing claimed.

“I am inspired by Ms. Bianco’s courage and dedication to holding Brian Warner accountable,” Bianco’s lawyer, Jay Ellwanger, told Rolling Stone.

“While we understand that the criminal investigations are still ongoing, it is vital that we pursue every possible avenue to hold him accountable for the horrific acts he committed.”

Back in February, Bianco spoke out for the first time against Manson, whom she branded as a ""monster.""

Bianco, who starred as Ros in the first three seasons of the show, began dating Manson in 2011, several years after they first met, she claims in a story published in New York Magazine.

Her accusations come after at least five women including Hollywood star Evan Rachel Wood, 33, publicly accused the rocker, 52, of abuse.

Wood - who worked with Bianco in 2019 to reform domestic violence laws in California - alleged Manson ""horrifically abused me for years.""

Wood, who stars in HBO show Westworld, said: ""The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson.

""He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission.""

Manson refuted the allegations insisting all his romantic relationships have been ""entirely consensual.""

In a statement posted on Instagram at the time they first began to go public, he said: ""Obviously, my life and my art have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.

""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""

On Thursday, November 19, 2020, Orlando Hall became the eighth person to be federally executed in 2020, after he was sentenced to death for the murder, kidnap and rape of Lisa Rene in 1994.

Orlando Hall was convicted of kidnapping, raping and killing Lisa Rene in 1994.

Who was Orlando Hall?

Orlando Cordia Hall - an African-American male from El Dorado, Arkansas - ran an interstate drug trafficking ring along with Bruce Webster and Marvin Holloway.

Police records state that Hall sold marijuana in Pine Bluff, Arkansa,s in the early 1990s.

The gang purchased marijuana in varying amounts in the Dallas/Fort Worth area with the assistance of Steven Beckley, who lived in Irving, Texas.

The marijuana was transported, typically by Beckley, to Arkansas and stored in Holloway's house.

Not much is known about Hall's upbringing except for some details included in court documents.

Several members of the town community described how Hall once saved his young cousin from drowning in a motel swimming pool.

The same records describe a childhood marked by violence, abuse, and neglect.

Aspiring surgeon Lisa Rene - then 16 - was beaten, raped and buried alive by three men in 1994

When did Orlando Hall kidnap and rape Lisa Rene?

Hall was convicted of kidnapping and killing Lisa Rene in 1994.

The murderer, along with three other men, snatched the schoolgirl from her Arlington, Texas, home, prosecutors said.

The revenge attack on Rene was to get back at the girl's two brothers over a botched $5,000 marijuana deal on September 24, 1994.

Rene was kidnapped from her sister's apartment that same day and - over the span of 48 hours - was repeatedly gang-raped in a motel in Arkansas.

Two days later, on September 26, Hall and two other men drove Rene to Byrd Lake Natural Area in Pine Bluff and covered her eyes with a mask.

They led her to a gravesite they had dug a day earlier, before Hall placed a sheet over Rene’s head then hit her with a shovel.

When she tried to run, another man and Hall took turns hitting her with the shovel – before gagging her and dragging her into the grave, where she was doused in gasoline before dirt was shoveled over her.

According to court records, when Rene contacted 911 before getting kidnapped she told the dispatcher: ""They’re trying to break down my door! Hurry up!”

The phone line cut off after a muffled scream was heard and a man said: ""Who are you on the phone with?""

Her body wasn't discovered until eight days after the horrific ordeal and it was later determined that Rene died of asphyxiatio.

Medical examiners said she was alive when she was buried by Hall and his accomplices.

Orlando Hall, 49, was pronounced dead at 11.47pm on Thursday, November 19, 2020 in Terre Haute, Indiana

When was Orlando Hall executed?

Orlando Hall, 49, was pronounced dead at 11.47pm on Thursday, November 19, 2020, in Terre Haute, Indiana - and was the eighth federal inmate to be executed in 2020.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons said Hall had been given a lethal injection at the federal prison complex.

In his final moments, Hall invited others to Islam, thanked those who supported him and told them: “I’m OK.”

After a statement recounting his horrific crime was read out, Hall told his supporters: “Take care of yourselves. Tell my kids I love them.”

Who was Lisa Rene and what have her family said about her death?

Lisa Rene was a 16-year-old Lamar High School honor roll student who was abducted from her sister’s Arlington apartment.

The aspiring surgeon was raped, beaten and buried alive to get revenge on her brothers for a $5,000 drug-deal rip-off, prosecutors said.

Hall, one of five suspects in the case, was sentenced to death in 1994. He was executed 26 years after he subjected the teenager to the harrowing ordeal.

In a victim impact statement released by prison officials, Rene's older sister, Pearl Rene, said Hall's execution “marks the end of a very long and painful chapter in our lives”.

The short horror film premieres on streaming service Alter today and follows two women,one of whom murders men with a snake hidden in her pants, on a road trip.

6 Snake D*** is a new short horror film streaming on Alter

""Snake D*** is one of those ideas that seems exciting at first but then people soon talk you out of it, like you’re crazy,"" filmmaker David Mahmoudieh told Dread Central.

Mahmoudieh was inspired ""to show my support of empowered women"" and began “thinking about ways to represent that metaphorical manifestation of male fear towards female empowerment"".

Set against the backdrop of the 2020 US presidential campaign, Snake D*** follows two women - Jill and Julia - on a Californian road trip.

Poppy Drayton (Charmed, The Shannara Chronicles) plays Jill and Sierra Pond (The Wrong Daughter, Throw Like A Girl) plays Julia in the short film which, serves as an allegory of the political divide created over the past four years.

6 But things get dicey when they run into two rednecks from the opposite side of the political divide

6 The film is an allegory for toxic masculinity and how men feel threatened by female empowerment

They come face to face with two hillbilly rednecks at a remote petrol station and it's this interaction that dominates the narrative of Snake D***.

The men threaten to hurt the women, who they keep referring to as ""b****s.""

Tired of the rednecks threats, Julia pulls out a secret weapon - an ancient wood musical instrument.

6 Jill brings out a secret weapon, an ancient instrument that can summon a murderous snake

As she begins to play it, the camera pans to just under Jill's skirt in anticipation of the murderous snake which will inevitable strike out to kill the hillbillies who look on in fear, not knowing what is about to happen.

“This is only a glimpse into a much broader, stranger world I want to explore. The feature is set against the backdrop of the 2020 election — sort of a ‘How The Election Was Really Won or Lost’ kind of thing — so the outcome of that will certainly influence my ending. Hopefully, it’s the one where you-know-who loses,” Mahmoudieh explained.

But in January 2017 officers said they were scaling back the probe, leaving her mum devastated that she may never find out what happened to her daughter.

What happened to Claudia Lawrence?

Claudia Lawrence was last seen near her home in Melrosegate, Heworth, York, on the evening of March 18, 2009.

The 35-year-old, who worked as a chef at the University of York, had spoken to her mum on the phone that night, giving no hint anything was wrong.

But the young woman was never heard from again — leaving officers desperately probing into her past, her relationships and her work life in an effort to find her.

At one point, detectives believed she had been with 12 lovers over five years, with some of them married.

During the investigation, a number of people were arrested over Claudia's disappearance, but none of them were charged.

And so her family has been left waiting, hoping they will one day have answers.

Other theories have been floated, with one that convicted killer Christopher Halliwell was involved in her disappearance.

The date was said to be significant to wannabe serial killer Halliwell — whose former garden in Swindon was dug up by cops in the search for more victims.

The murderer abducted and killed his second known victim on March 19, 2011 — exactly two years after Claudia vanished.

What is Claudia's Law?

Claudia’s Law – otherwise known as the Guardianship (Missing Persons) Act 2017 – came into force on July 31, 2019.

The change in the law means families of missing loved ones will be able to take control of their financial affairs in their absence.

Campaigners say this is a huge step forward in recognising the responsibilities placed on relatives when someone disappears and the current legal difficulties in obtaining permission to act on their behalf.

Previously, families could only take over the financial affairs of a missing person if they were declared dead under the Presumption of Death Act 2013.

When did Claudia Lawrence disappear?

Claudia was last heard from on March 18, 2009, with reports that she was last seen walking towards her home on Heworth Road.

The next day, the 35-year-old never made it to work at 6am, with the chef also not heading to her local pub that evening.

Her family made an emotional plea for help days after she was last seen.

More than a month after the missing person's report was opened, police upgraded the investigation to suspected murder.

Detectives also revealed there had been a reported sighting of Claudia at Melrosegate Bridge, with a woman spotted alongside a hooded man.

A year after her disappearance, her best friend Suzy Cooper appealed for help, saying: ""We want it to end. We want her back.""

Has the Claudia Lawrence case been closed?

In January 2017 police announced that they were scaling back the investigation into Claudia's disappearance.

But in June 2019, it was thought Claudia's mobile phone could hold a clue to the mystery.

Sources close to the police investigation believe it suggests she was killed by someone she knew, perhaps in her social circle.

The Times reported that evidence shows her mobile phone was active near her home four hours after her disappearance, having failed to turn up for work at York University ten years ago on March 19, 2009.

Assistant Chief Constable Paul Kennedy said: ""It is not for the want of trying that a breakthrough has not yet come, but rather the result of the continuing refusal of those who know what happened to Claudia to come forward and tell us the truth.

""The case will not be closed until those responsible for Claudia’s disappearance and, we believe, her murder, are brought to justice.

""Whilst the current review team will and has been scaled down, the new Cleveland and North Yorkshire cold case dedicated team will still have responsibility to review any information that is considered relevant.

""Disappointing news though this is for Claudia’s family, we have not given up hope, and I do believe that one day we will be able to tell them what happened to Claudia.""

The missing woman's family has vowed to keep searching with her mum Joan saying: ""I realise the recent police team have worked very hard to try and get answers, and I know they feel people are still lying to them, but I can’t allow Claudia’s name to be forgotten.

""I will do everything in my power to ensure people keep searching for my beloved and precious daughter.""

The first pictures of Claudia Lawrence's home were released by Joan in February 2017, who showed how the house had barely been touched since her daughter vanished.

On the tenth anniversary of her disappearance cops admitted that the search for Claudia was hampered by the withholding of vital information.

In October 2019 her mum slammed the “peanuts” £40,000 budget to probe murder suspect Christopher Halliwell.

Distraught Joan Lawrence, 76, said it was impossible for cops to investigate convicted killer Halliwell with ""such a small amount of money"".

A TV documentary titled ""Claudia Lawrence: Missing or Murdered"" will be aired at 9:15pm tonight on Channel 5.

Who are Claudia Lawrence's parents Peter and Joan?

Peter Lawrence, who devoted himself to helping others with missing relatives, died after never knowing what happened to his daughter.

Claudia's dad was 74 and died on February 11 at St Leonard's Hospice in York following a short illness, his family said in a statement.

Joan Lawrence, is 76 and lives alone in North Yorkshire.

She supports the Missing People charity and makes her telephone number available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to support others who have missing loved ones.

Vile Robert McNab was found with the sickening stash of more than 500 videos last year.

The fiend, who was caged in 2017 for having a hoard of child abuse videos and conspiring to get a stranger pregnant so he could rape the tot, was caught after a cleaner found his secret phone full of extreme videos.

McNab, also known as Robert Aitman, started downloading bestiality on his hidden mobile the same day he was released from jail, Greenock Sheriff Court heard yesterday.

The paedo kept it quiet from cops and social workers monitoring him, but he was rumbled when a cleaner found it stashed under a pillow in his homeless flat in Greenock and handed it in to police.

This sparked the case into McNab, who then pleaded guilty to charges of possessing extreme pornographic images, showing sexual activity between a person and an animal, and breaking a Sexual Offences Prevention Order.

The court heard McNab - who downloaded 579 images between May 7 and 22, 2020 - spends his life watching porn and turned to bestiality in a bid to stop himself watching child abuse.

The Daily Record reports Defence solicitor Gerry Keenan told Sheriff Joseph Hughes: ""He says he was attempting to suppress his inclination towards the type of behaviour your Lordship sees in his previous convictions.

""It was designed to avoid the type of criminal activity that led to his incarceration previously.

""He didn't look at any types of indecent images referred to in his previous convictions - this was something different.""

Mr Keenan described McNab, who was abused as a child, as a loner and revealed he ""ought solace in the online community"".

The sex beast will be jailed for his crimes, but after hearing that prosecutors wanted to impose another SOPO on McNab, Sheriff Hughes deferred sentence.

He said: ""I'm going to take further time to assess this.

""The sentence is going to be one of custody but, for me, the matter is the length of sentence.

Yes, she trains regularly, but her super-lean, athletic physique comes relatively easily and, as a result, it wasn’t much of a struggle to get back to normal post-pregnancy.

However, whisper that last bit, because Vogue admits today that her rapid snap-back wasn’t something she felt like celebrating – in fact, it made her extremely conscious of the message she sent out to other women. So much so, she deliberately hid her body away following the birth of her second baby, Gigi, last July.

8 Vogue recognises that the speed with which she regained her pre-baby body would be completely unrealistic for most new mums Credit: Mark Hayman

“There is so much pressure put on women about this and I didn’t want to add to that when actually, instead of worrying about losing the baby weight, we should be worrying about where our pelvic floor is at and how our mental health is doing. All of that is so much more important.

“It’s purely down to my body type that I went back to how I was before without too much effort, and I did find myself trying to hide that for the first few months. I’d always done my tanning stuff [Insta posts promoting her line of self-tan products], but I wanted to wait so as not to annoy people.

“I just didn’t want to make anyone else feel bad by being all, ‘hey, look at me after having a baby,’ because the last thing anyone wants to see is someone who’s lost the weight quicker than you.”

Empathetic and sensitive, it’s an honest admission and shows that Vogue, 35, understands that with influencing comes responsibility. She recognises that the speed with which she regained her pre-baby body would be completely unrealistic for most new mums.

She also points out that she knew she’d be criticised for losing weight too quickly – there is judgement and policing right across the spectrum when it comes to women’s bodies.

“That’s the thing about the internet,” she says. “If you lose the weight fast, everyone assumes you jumped into it and if you don’t then you get people saying: ‘Ooh, she’s still carrying her baby weight’. So you kind of can’t win. People think it makes them feel better if they say something awful about someone else, but I would rather be super-positive and then whatever you put out comes back.

“And when it’s to do with anyone else’s body, the best thing you can do is not pass comment at all.”

The vast majority of Vogue’s social media interactions are positive, she says. She has a “lovely group of people” (all 840,000 of them) following her and it generally feels like a very supportive community. But occasionally she sees a comment that cuts deep.

8 The TV star says she's 'definitely a feminist' Credit: Mark Hayman

“Sometimes you see that and of course it gets to me. I am happy, my life is amazing, I have two amazing kids, a great husband [former Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews, 32] and I’m so happy in my life and with what I’m doing, so I pull back and remember that. But some of the stuff that’s written is just so awful.

“And Spencer wouldn’t get nearly as much as me. It’s normally always pointed at women.”

Is she a feminist?

“I’m definitely a feminist. It’s so important as a woman to be a feminist, especially considering everything those before us fought for. It doesn’t mean you’re a man-hater or burning your bra, which is why perhaps some people shy away [from the label]. But as a girl it is so important to know your rights.”

Like so many of us, Vogue was deeply affected by the disappearance and murder of 33-year-old marketing executive Sarah Everard last month.

It happened just a couple of miles away from the south-west London home Vogue shares with Spencer and their two children, Theodore, two and a half, and Gigi, eight months, and so felt too close for comfort.

“I know people go missing all the time, but it’s so frightening when it is so close to you,” she says. “We don’t live very far from there. She was going home. My heart breaks for her family, it’s the worst story you can think of.”

I’m definitely a feminist. It’s so important as a woman to be a feminist, especially considering everything those before us fought for. Vogue Williams

The outpourings since Sarah’s death have opened up a national conversation about male violence and sexual harassment and the risk assessments women have to make every day as they go about their lives.

Vogue says it’s so ingrained as part and parcel of female life that it’s only the events of the last few weeks that have made her realise how limiting these constraints can be.

“It’s normal to be like that, it’s just part of life as a woman. I often wake up really early in the morning and I would love to just go for a run. But during the winter it’s quite dark and I would never in a million years go outside in the dark on my own, even before all of this happened.

“I wouldn’t feel comfortable out on the streets on my own, and I think most women feel the same. It shouldn’t be that way, but I can’t see how it will ever change either. I don’t think it will ever feel 100% safe and that’s really sad.”

Sparky and sharp as a tack, Vogue is always good to talk to. There’s rarely any waffle or spinning off on tangents, she sticks to the question in hand and answers it straight. This business-like approach to life must also work well managing a busy household as a family of four.

“It’s quite hectic – total mayhem – but it’s also amazing. Gigi is a brilliant little baby, so cute, it’s like she’s just so happy to be alive! And Theodore absolutely loves her so it’s all been going really well.

“I think this time around I’m more relaxed, so it just seems a lot easier I suppose. I put her down and she settles herself, but that’s probably down to the fact we couldn’t pander to her as much as we did Theodore, because we have less time now with two.”

Being born in the middle of the pandemic means Gigi hasn’t had the chance to meet many of her family. Vogue is careful not to moan, but concedes that this lockdown generation of babies and their extended families have really missed out.

“Obviously people are going through way worse than what we are, but it is really upsetting. One of my brothers has never met her and even my mum has only been able to see her once.

""I haven’t been able to get to Ireland because of the quarantine and travel rules so I’ve not been home in over a year. By the time people get to meet her, she’s going to be about a year old, so it’s a big part of her life to miss.

“Everyone has things going on that are upsetting during Covid, and when you put it into perspective with what other people are going through with illness and losing their jobs and their livelihoods, we’re getting off lightly I suppose. They will all meet her soon enough.”

She won’t comment on the family’s controversial trip to St Barts in late December when London was in Tier 4 and everyone was instructed to stay at home, although she took to Instagram at the time insisting she’d been there working and hadn’t broken any rules.

Nevertheless, she does say this third lockdown has been the toughest of all for her. Vogue found the uncertainty was triggering the anxiety she’d been able to keep at bay over the last few years and so she turned to therapy to cope.

“I found the first month of this one particularly hard – it was so cold and dark and just not being able to see the end of it was tough. I felt nervous because it was like it was never going to end.

“I don’t have regular therapy, but I did recently go back. My anxiety was pretty bad. I take medication for it sometimes and it’s easier to try and figure things out in your mind if you’ve got someone else who is a professional and who can help you muddle through any stuff. He’s an amazing therapist and I’ll always go back and forth, I think. I’ll always have him in my back pocket.”

She adds: “You wouldn’t notice [my anxiety] for the most part, but out of nowhere it will come on. I’ve become good at managing it and when I find it a little too much I have beta blockers, which really help.

""I try to train every day, eat healthily and stay away from junk food because that’s a real trigger for me. If I’m not organised then I get stressed about the things I have to do so I try to have everything in order so I am less stressed and therefore less anxious. People have different coping mechanisms and, for me, watching what I eat, not drinking too much and training help the most.”

8 This month she launches a new podcast, My Therapist Ghosted Me, with comedian friend Joanne McNally Credit: Mark Hayman

Being able to work “the whole way through” has also helped. Vogue has a weekly Sunday breakfast show on Heart, presents regularly on Channel 4’s Steph’s Packed Lunch and hosts a successful podcast with Spencer, which is in its third series.

This month she launches a new podcast, My Therapist Ghosted Me, with comedian friend Joanne McNally. Each episode is an hour of completely unfiltered conversation between two best mates, and Vogue can’t wait to get it out there.

“I wanted to have a positive, fun podcast that you could imagine as sitting around with your mates and talking about what’s going on during the week. We want everyone to feel like they’re out having drinks with us – it’s literally just a chat so the whole thing rolls.

“Joanne and I have always been in the same friend group since we were 18, but we clicked as really close friends in the last two years. She’s just one of those people that if you’re feeling s**t you can ring her and she will automatically lift your mood.

“If this year has shown me anything, it’s how much I value my friendships. I love being around her, she’s brilliant.”

Given its free-flowing, stream of consciousness, no-holds-barred kind of vibe… should Spencer be worried?

If this year has shown me anything, it’s how much I value my friendships Vogue Williams

“He should be!” laughs Vogue. “But he loves being talked about so it’s all good.”

These days, Spencer works full-time on his Clean Co brand of low-alcohol spirits, and Vogue says he’s enjoying his new role as an entrepreneur after years of reality TV.

“He is loving it. That’s what he spends his nine-to-five doing now and it’s going really well, which is fantastic. I think this is more his vibe [than the celebrity world]. If the right TV project came along, I’m sure he’d do that, but this is his baby. He’s found something he really loves and he’s put so much of his focus and energy into it so it’s lovely to see how well he is doing.”

Spencer gave up alcohol three years ago and has said if he hadn’t, Vogue may well have left him. She plays this down today.

“I don’t necessarily prefer him sober because he wasn’t a messy drunk and he was never mean. But he is a million times more productive this way. He was drinking so regularly that he was never fully focused or motivated.”

They both hope there will be more kids in the future.

In the makeup chair with Vogue What’s your skincare routine? I change my products regularly so my skin doesn’t get used to the same thing. I use a liquid cleanser with a face cloth, then put a serum on and a night cream. I spray on Bare by Vogue Face Tanning Mist twice a week, and always use an SPF30+. What’s your luxury item? L’Occitane Almond Shower Oil – It smells amazing. Who’s your beauty icon? Kate Bosworth is gorgeous and classic. Best beauty bargain? You can get great false lashes in Primark. And I love Carmex for my lips. What’s your top beauty tip? I love an HD brow – it makes such a difference to your face and the way it’s framed. It can make you look younger. Describe your beauty evolution? I’ve had some horrific mishaps with my eyebrows in the past! And I take real care of my skin now as well.

“I wouldn’t say we were done yet. I would love to have more, if we are lucky enough. Spenny is the same, he’s up to five now. Seriously. I’ve told him that no one will invite us anywhere if we have five! But I think definitely four.”

While TV and radio will always be her first loves Vogue has built up a lucrative business as an influencer and collaborator, much of it via Instagram.

She has just launched a collection of pastel-coloured tracksuits with cashmere label Lucy Nagle and has teamed up with Fairy as the face of its new Non-bio Platinum Pods.

“Fairy is such an iconic brand and so when they came to me it was like: ‘Oh my god, I’m going to be a Fairy Mum!’ which was very exciting.

“For me my main base has always been TV and radio but then getting to work with brands I’ve loved for years is the icing on the cake.”

The Westminster Police Department confirmed the incident happened at around 4pm on Wednesday.

Two officers were trying to detain a woman accused of assault as a third officer stood by.

Footage shows police trying to lift the woman from the curb but she falls to the ground.

Her hands are cuffed behind her back but then she appears to kick out, ABC7 reports.

A cop is then seen punching her twice.

The woman is heard swearing at the man for striking her in the head.

The two other officers restrained him and he backed off as they brought the woman under control.

The WPD Internal Affairs Division is liaising with the Orange County Attorney’s Office to determine if criminal charges can be brought forward.

The officer has been placed on leave while an investigation takes place.

Police received a report that a woman had assaulted another woman who had been trying to rescue a dog running in the street.

Cops said the woman showed signs of being under the influence and became combative with officers while waiting for paramedics.

In a statement exclusively obtained by TMZ, a WPD officer was said to have ""used force and struck [the woman] two times in the face with his first. Two WPD officers immediately intervened and de-escalated the situation"".

The woman was taken to a nearby hospital but was later booked into the Orange County jail.

The shocking incident came just one day after killer cop Derek Chauvin was found guilty of the murder of George Floyd on all counts.

The 45-year-old former officer faces a maximum sentence of 75 years in jail after being found guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

The second-degree murder charge carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, the third-degree murder charge a maximum of 25 years and the second-degree manslaughter charge a maximum of 10 years.

Chauvin is currently facing a maximum of 75 years behind bars, however, prosecutors previously said they’d be seeking enhanced sentences for all convictions.

Ma'Khia Bryant, 16, was killed by a cop in Ohio moments before Chauvin was found guilty of murdering George Floyd.

The white cop, who was identified as Nicholas Reardon, has been placed on administrative leave while police investigate if his actions were justified, Police Chief Michael Woods told The Columbus Dispatch.

The horrific scene showed one man assaulting the other after a consensual hook-up.

6 Paapa Essiedu plays Kwame in the BBC drama I May Destroy You which was created by Michaela Coel

Gangs of London star Paapa Essiedu, who plays the gay Kwame in the BBC One series, said the moment made history for British television.

""It was a historical moment in British TV,"" he told Obsessed With... podcast host Sophie Duker.

""I just felt it was so rich because of the story it told, not only with what happened to him but the depth of connection that those three central characters have together.""

Most of the series revolves around successful writer Arabella, played by Black earth Rising star Michaela Coel, as she tries to get her next book off the ground while dabbling in the modern world of dating.

The drama follows the aftermath of Arabella's rape after someone spiked her drink on a night out.

Paapa added: ""He can’t communicate that to Arabella because he knows she can’t deal with it at the time and he ends up taking the hit for it.'

The fourth out of 12 episodes depicts Kwame's love life and how he meets men through app such as, Grindr.

Kwame hooks up with a bi-curious friend and a stranger and they engage in a threesome, but Kwame's mate decided to call it a night as he and the stranger begin to have sex.

However, things took a turn for the worse as Kwame was forced back onto the bed when he tried to leave and was raped by the stranger he had just had consensual sex with.

Paapa admitted he struggled to process the horrible events told in the script.

He said: ""I found it really difficult to read when I first read it.

“I think my first kind of instinct was like, it's so confrontational and so direct and so true, you know, so honest, and frank.

“I think it's difficult to manage that kind of effect on a story.

""That's not something that you can kind of allude to unless you really know what you're doing.

“So I think that's quite a singular quality about Michaela's writing, about this particular approach to storytelling... it's so authentic and honest and really, really direct.""



Actress Michaela has told how her new drama was inspired by her own real-life spiking incident.

She created the series, directed it and played the role of writer Arabella.

The 32-year-old told Metro.co.uk: ""In 2016, I was very much like the Arabella you see in the first episode.

""I was doing an all-nighter and went out to meet a friend for a drink for a break and my drink was spiked by a stranger just like Arabella, and this really was the inspiration of the entire show.

The girl, who can't be named, fled the supermarket in tears and reported Adil Khan to the authorities after seeing he was with a young child.

She told a pal at the time: ""Oh my God, he's been in Asda. I've never been so scared in all my life. I feel like my heart just stopped beating.""

Khan - nicknamed Billy - and two other members of the notorious grooming gang still remain in Rochdale despite losing an appeal against deportation back to Pakistan two years ago, MEN reports.

The cabbie got his victim pregnant when she turned 13 and trafficked a second girl, 15, to other abusers during the sickening abuse, which was portrayed in BBC series Three Girls.

He was among nine men of mostly Pakistani heritage caged in 2012 over a string of serious sex offences against five vulnerable victims.

The fiends would ply the young girls with booze then abuse them before sharing the victims among other abusers at depraved parties across the north of England.

'SHE WAS FACE-TO-FACE WITH HIM'

His victim, who bravely reported the abuse to former GMP detective Maggie Oliver, has now hit out at the failure to deport the trio.

Maggie famously worked on the police investigation but resigned in disgust at how the girls were treated and now works as a campaigner.

She told MEN: ""She walked into an aisle and was face-to-face with him. He had a seven or eight-year-old child with him. How can he have a child in his care? She just left her trolley and ran out in tears and called me.

""The question is why are they still here? Why are they back in Rochdale? What about the rights of the children they abused? It really is outrageous.""

The horror meeting in November 2014 was reported to Rochdale's safeguarding board, which includes police and council officials.

Maggie added: ""I don't necessarily blame the safeguarding board. These are the consequences of these sentences. These men should have had longer sentences. The children who have been abused have to live with that for the rest of their lives and that's just not right.

""This is not the only incident where one of the survivors has come face-to-face with their abuser. This isn't unique.""

SICKENING ABUSE

Four members of the grooming gang – including ringleader Shabir Ahmed – faced deportation to Pakistan having dual British and Pakistani citizenship.

In 2016, then-home secretary Theresa May ruled it would be ""conducive to the public good"" to deprive the four of the right to remain in the UK.

They then fought, and lost, a long legal battle against deprivation of UK citizenship, losing a final Court of Appeal ruling in 2018.

In June 2019, three of the group were revealed to be still living in Britain, with no signs of any being prepared for deportation to Pakistan.

One of the men, Abdul Rauf, 51, is a father of five, a taxi driver and a former teacher at a mosque.

His sentence was six years for trafficking and sex with a girl, who was aged 15.

Abdul Aziz, 49, is a father of three and carried the more sinister title of 'The Master'.

He was originally sentenced to nine years for trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex with a child.

Adil Khan, 50, was given eight years for conspiracy and trafficking a 13-year-old girl who later became pregnant.

All three men have served their sentences and their victims are still forced to face them roaming the streets.

Rochdale Borough Council leader Allen Brett said: “The government must now finally act to have these men removed from the country. The council is providing support to many of the victims of these terrible crimes and have for many years now been helping to bring more perpetrators of sexual abuse to justice.

""That work will continue but only the Home Secretary can provide further closure by fulfilling the previous promises that have been made to deport the offenders whose citizenship has been removed.”

A spokesperson for the Home Office refused to outline why the three men had not yet been deported.

They said: ""We are committed to removing foreign national offenders wherever possible. Foreign national offenders should be in no doubt of our determination to remove them, and since 2010 we have removed more than 52,000 criminals.”

SICK GROOMING GANG Ahmed, known as ""Daddy"", was the ringleader of the gang. He is still serving a 22-year jail term for rape. Former taxi driver Aziz, a father-of-three, regularly took his young victim to different flats around Rochdale, where she was plied with cannabis and vodka and coerced into sex with men who paid him cash. Referred to as ""The Master"" by the gang, he played a ""leading role"" in the grooming. Jailed for nine years in May 2012, he was released in December 2015 after serving three years and seven months. Rauf, a father-of-five, trafficked a 15-year-old girl for sex, driving her to secluded areas to have sex with her in his taxi and ferry her to a flat in Rochdale where he and others had sex with her. He was jailed for six years and released in November 2014 after serving two years and six months of his sentence. A neighbour said he has a night-time driving job. Khan got a girl, 13, pregnant but denied he was the father then met another girl, 15, and trafficked her to others using violence when she complained. He was sentenced to eight years, released in 2016 and was last known to be living in Manchester. For two years from early 2008, girls as young as 12 were plied with alcohol and drugs and gang-raped in rooms above takeaway shops and ferried to different flats in taxis where cash was paid to use the girls. Police said as many as 47 girls were groomed.

The judge, who has held the military’s most senior legal role since October, spoke out when questioned over the poor conviction rate in military tribunals for rapes and sexual assaults.

He said: “It would be quite interesting to look at the conviction rate for, let’s say, university students, who are usually thoroughly decent young people of good character.

“They drink too much; they end up in the wrong bed. It goes to court. What is the conviction rate?

“I would have thought it was about the same as the one we get, because our servicepeople are thoroughly good people, but they drink too much, something goes wrong and they end up in court.”

The 2001 case is being re-investigated in Channel 4 documentary Murder in the Outback, which looks at the story that hit the headlines after Peter’s girlfriend Joanne Lees escaped the attacker.

Who is Bradley John Murdoch?

Bradley John Murdoch was convicted of killing British backpacker Peter Falconio in 2001 and is currently serving a life sentence for the crime.

Peter and girlfriend Joanne Lees were on a road trip through the Australian outback when they were flagged down by a man in a truck and attacked.

Peter didn't survive but Joanne managed to escape and was able to help identify Murdoch as the killer.

Murdoch shot Falconio in the head before attacking Joanne and restraining her with cable ties in his car.

Joanne managed to escape and hide in nearby bushes for five hours, before waving down a passing truck for help.

Police were never able to locate Falconio's body.

Bradley was born on February 29, 1958, in Geraldton, Western Australia, to a mechanic and a hairdresser.

He lived in Northampton and then Perth - where he reportedly joined a biker gang after dropping out of school aged 15.

He was a drug smuggler who served 15 months for shooting at crowds celebrating at an Australian rules football match in 1995.

Eight years later, just before he was charged with Peter's murder, he was charged with seven counts of abduction and rape, but later acquitted.

He has always protested his innocence in the murder case.

What happened to Bradley John Murdoch?

Sixteen months after the incident, Murdoch was arrested and charged with Peter’s murder thanks to Joanne’s identification combined with DNA evidence.

Murdoch pleaded not guilty to Peter’s murder and to assaulting and attempting to kidnap Joanne.

But he was unanimously convicted in 2005 and sentenced to life imprisonment.

The former soldier reportedly went to the woman’s house to take their two-week-old baby, but she refused to let him in and told him to leave.

The couple broke up while Theresa was pregnant after she claimed to have caught him cheating with another woman.

Theresa had given the baby the night before to her sister after receiving threats from her ex-boyfriend that he would take the child.

Rommer barged into the gate of the woman’s house but was angry at being asked to leave before a confrontation followed.

The former officer was looking for the baby but the defiant woman would not tell him where the child was.

Soon after, Rommer allegedly took out his gun and threatened his ex-girlfriend before allegedly shooting her dead.

The man then rushed back to his motorbike to escape. He was found by police the day after.

The woman’s body was found by relatives who rushed her to the hospital but she was declared dead by paramedics.

Speaking this week with an update on the case, Lieutenant Colonel Jun Wacnag, chief of the Mangaldan Police, said prosecutors believe the two fighting over the custody of their newborn son.

Darcy pleaded not guilty to murder at the New South Wales Supreme Court in Sydney, Australia, Daily Mail Australia reported.

She allegedly murdered sheep farmer Mr Dunbar, 42, at his home in Walcha, New South Wales on August 2, 2017.

Mr Dunbar's body was found in his bed with a plastic bag on his head.

A tube connected to a gas cylinder was found inside the bag.

During an opening address at court today, prosecutor Brett Hatfield said Mr Dunbar's property was worth $3.5 million (£1.9 million).

In 2015, Mr Dunbar made a new will and left his estate to Darcy, Mr Hatfield said.

Mr Hatfield alleged that Darcy's motive for the murder was to get the estate for herself by faking his suicide.

The crown's case is based on internet searches - which Mr Hatfield claims were made by Darcy.

Mr Hatfield said in court: ""The accused acknowledges she made some but not all the searches.

""She has suggested the deceased made a number of them.""

INTERNET SEARCHES

Searches found by investigators included poisonous spiders, mushrooms and pants, methods to commit suicide, how to commit murder and ""can police see websites you visit on your mobile"".

Darcy allegedly mixed sedatives in a blender and then gave them to Mr Dunbar as a drink in a glass tumbler.

She had been married to Colin Crossman but they had been separated.

On August 2 at 1.14am, Mr Crossman received a text message from Mr Dunbar's phone which read: ""Tell police to come to house, I don't want Tash or kids to find me"".

About 45 minutes later, Darcy rang emergency services saying she had found Mr Dunbar in bed with a plastic bag on his head and gas being pumped into it.

In court, Mr Hatfield said that in January 2009, Darcy had asked Mr Crossman how hard someone would have to hit in order to cause damage to their temple.

Later that night, Darcy got a hammer and hit Mr Crossman in the temple while he slept, Mr Hatfield said.

She claimed he had been attacked by an intruder but lter admitted it was her, according to Mr Hatfield.

He said that another time Darcy had poured a tin of petrol on the bedroom floor while her husband was asleep and set it on fire.

She had earlier given him tacos for dinner - and samples later showed that he had sedatives in his system, despite not knowingly taking any drugs.

But it's come too late for one of his big sponsors BMW who have dropped the middleweight from an ambassador role with the company.

He was scheduled to be the 'face of BMW New Zealand' according to Australian TV network Nine, but that idea has been canned.

A statement read: ""Due to the comments made by an athlete online, we have reviewed our pending association with said athlete and we have decided not to push forward with a specific ambassador for the brand at this time in New Zealand.""

After receiving worldwide criticism for the sick taunt, Adesanya has admitted he 'crossed the line'.

Adesanya hit out at UFC rival Holland in an Instagram video and said: ""Bro, I will f***ing rape you.""

The sick post has now been deleted by the New Zealander.

In a short statement he shared on Twitter, the 185-pound UFC champ said: “Last weekend fight talk escalated to a point in which I crossed the line.

""I understand the gravity of this word and how it can affect and hurt other people apart from my opponent, although that was NEVER my intention.

""I am still to growing under the spotlight, and I take this as a lesson to be more selective with words under pressure.""

Even my husband doesn’t know what happened to me.”

These are the heartbreaking words spoken by one of black cab rapist John Worboys’ victims.

Known only as NBV, she was one of two survivors who succeeded in stopping the release of one of the UK’s most prolific serial rapists of women.

Now, she is ready to tell her harrowing story in a new Channel 5 documentary, Predator: Catching the Black Cab Rapist.

In it, she says she is “extremely appalled” by hearing, for the first time, the way police apologised to Worboys for questioning him and even fed him a possible line of defence after she reported her assault.

The woeful interview meant he was free to continue his vile assaults until he was finally caught more than six months later.

NBV says: “The police had made me believe nothing had happened.”

Women’s safety has become a national talking point this week after Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens was charged with the kidnap and murder of Sarah Everard.

He is also suspected of a sex offence on another woman three days before Sarah disappeared in Clapham, south London.

Solicitor Harriet Wistrich, director for the Centre for Women’s Justice, who helped block Worboys’ release in 2018, said: “Women are at risk from male violence in so many settings, even when they take steps to protect themselves, like using a black cab.

“Worboys, like the allegations against the suspect, was allowed to become more and more dangerous because he wasn’t effectively policed.”

The programme charts Worboys’ horrific spree of attacks in which he is believed to have preyed on more than 100 women in London over at least five years.

NBV was his 79th victim and is coming forward now because she has recently become a mother and wants a safer world for her child.

She says: “It’s really important the police do their jobs correctly and mistakes are not repeated in the future.”

Cops had the chance to arrest Worboys after she reported the attack in July 2007, but they let him off without asking several key questions.

The tape of that interview will be heard for the first time on the documentary.

Previously, only transcripts were read in court.

Producer Sheun Adelasoye, Head of Access at October Films, said: “The tape itself was never played. Having heard the tape in its entirety, I can see why.”

In it, one officer is heard apologising to Worboys for interviewing him.

An officer also suggests NBV might have offered sex to pay for her fare.

Shuen adds: “They give Worboys possible reasons to support why the complainant NBV wasn’t credible and they laugh and joke with him about some of the allegations NBV made.”

'After the pill, I don't remember anything'

For NBV, listening to the tape brought back that horrific night when, as a 19-year-old student, she stepped into Worboys black cab outside a London nightclub.

She says: “Hearing his voice is incredibly traumatic. It takes me back to being in his cab.”

NBV had been careful not to drink much that night because she was working the following day.

She describes the driver as “approachable and chatty.”

She says: “He told me he had won a lot of money and showed me the money. He said he was celebrating and asked me to have a drink with him.”

This was Worboys’ modus operandi.

He would pick up young women from outside bars and clubs and insist they should have a drink to celebrate a big money win.

The drink was spiked with over-the-counter medicines, which, combined with the alcohol, would render the woman stupefied, with little or no recollection of the attack.

NBV initially refused the drink, but on seeing Worboys becoming agitated, she took a sip to placate him.

She says: “I can only describe it as similar in colour to prosecco, however it didn’t taste like anything I had had before.”

When she started to become drowsy, Worboys stopped the vehicle and forced a pill down her throat, gripping her cheeks to make sure she swallowed.

NBV says: “After the pill, I don’t remember anything.”

She woke up in her bed the following afternoon, having missed her shift at work, and started experiencing flashbacks.

She says: “I knew something terrible had happened.”

After reporting the attack to her university, she gave a police statement, which she describes as “humiliating.”

She says police asked about her drinking and noting her red nail polish, asked if she often also wore red lipstick.

NBV said: “They made me feel like anything that had happened to me was because I deserved it.”

13 Expert criminologist Prof Aisha Gill brands Worboys actions as 'disturbing' and 'Machiavellian'

13 Dave Hanson, a former stripper and colleague of Worboys, speaks out in the new Channel 5 programme

CCTV footage led them to Worboys, but when police found he wasn’t at his home in Rotherhithe, south London, they left him a note, giving him time to prepare his defence.

In his interview at Plumstead Police Station, he claims he is “wary” of picking up drunk women and despite CCTV images showing him helping NBV into her halls of residence, he insists, “I certainly wasn’t touching her.”

He was released without charge, leaving him free to attack dozens more women until he was finally arrested on February, 16th, 2008.

NBV hoped the officers involved were sacked. In fact the detective inspector in charge was given a written warning.

Afterwards, Worboys, who also worked as a stripper, wrote hundreds of pages about the attack on NBV, extracts of which are heard on the Channel 5 documentary for the first time.

He wrote: “Police must have faith in me to let me carry on working. She kept flashing and rubbing her t*ts. She wanted to sh** and f*** me.

“Most men would have got hold of her and done worse things.”

Professor Aisha K. Gill, expert criminologist at the Univ of Roehampton, analysed the disturbing contents.

She said: “For him, when she gets into the cab, that’s a green light. That’s consent.

“He has a very disturbing Machiavellian script that’s very well rehearsed.”

'We owe both women a lot'

In the diary, which also covers victim number 80, Worboys claims it was him who was the victim of sexual assault in both.

NBV is also shown pictures of Worboys’ rape kit, including a bag of money, the drugs and bottles of alcohol he used.

NBV said: “Looking at these pictures, I can’t help but think had the police gone to Worboys’ home when I had reported the crime, they would have found evidence.”

Worboys was found guilty of 19 charges of drugging and sexually assaulting 12 women, in one case raping his victim, at Croydon Crown Court in March 2009 and given an indeterminate prison sentence.

In 2013, NBV and the victim known as DSD took the police to court for failing to investigate their assaults properly, and won.

Historically, the police had immunity against negligence suits, but this set a precedent that they could be sued for failure to investigate sexual assault cases.

Lawyer Harriet Wistrich, who acted for them, said: “NBV and DSD are extraordinary women.

“They felt a moral duty to hold the police accountable - not only for the justice of their own situation but because they wanted to ensure lessons were learned.

“This was a great public service and we owe both women a lot.”

Just eight years into Worboys’ prison sentence, in 2016, NBV discovered from a newspaper article that he had been granted release by the parole board.

Again, she and DSD, took their fight to court and succeeded in overturning the decision.

In 2019, he was convicted of four further offences and given two life sentences.

Mrs Justice McGowan told him: “I do not know when, if ever, you will cease to be a risk.”

But Harriet says the Crown Prosecution Service is often “risk averse” when it comes to making a decision to charge someone in rape cases, particularly in drug rape cases.

Referring to the protests about women’s safety on the streets in the wake of Sarah Everard’s murder, she says: “I am convinced other Worboys’ type offending is going unpunished.

“This is the crisis in the Criminal Justice System that has led to so many protesting in the last week.”

For NBV, she continued her moral fight despite often being “triggered” by Harriet’s phone calls and still has nightmares about the assault.

Sheun says: “NBV is adamant she is a survivor, not a victim.

“But she has an unjustified sense of guilt about the women who were raped after she made her complaint.

“Not ever really knowing the full detail of what happened to her is what most haunts her.”

Officer Nicholas Reardon opened fire on 16-year-old Bryant, who had been wielding a knife just seconds after he arrived on the scene in Columbus, Ohio, according to police footage.

The teenager drew the weapon during an altercation on the street with two other females the same day as Derek Chauvin's guilty verdict.

Cops say they received a disturbance call from a person who said someone was trying to stab them at 4.32pm, with officers arriving on scene minutes later at 4.44pm.

Reardon, was a graduate of Bishop Watterson Catholic school in Columbus and was a member of the school's wrestling team, according to Daily Beast.

The school posted updates on his progress whilst he attended Air Force basic combat training.

According to those updates, he graduated from the training in August 2017 before attending the military's Security Forces Tech School at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas.

The paper discovered a photograph of Reardon in his uniform at the time, which indicated he had completed training within a rank of Airman First Class.

The paper discovered a photograph of Reardon in his uniform at the time, which indicated he had completed training within a rank of Airman First Class.

Daily Beast also discovered he appears to be the son of retired Sergeant Edward Reardon.

Reardon Snr. worked with the Columbus Division of Police for 32 years and according to the publication, is an Air Force veteran.

He served as the Columbus Police Academy's basic training sergeant.

He retired last year and was honoured at an Ohio State Football game by one of his pals whose tweet was announced: ""I am very proud of my friend Sgt. Ted Reardon who was recognized at today's Ohio State Football game.

""I have served with him in the USAF 1984-1987 and @ColumbusPolice 1993-to present.

""May God bless him and his family!""

The Columbus Dispatch noted that Reardon Jr. followed in his father's footsteps and joined the police department in December 2019.

Police bodycamera video from the incident, released by Columbus police on Wednesday, showed two females arguing, as one was thrown to the ground.

The girl standing appeared to have a weapon in her hand – which police said was a knife – and moved against a vehicle with another female.

As the pair moved toward the vehicle, the girl who cops say had a blade raised her arm.

Someone could be heard yelling ""Get down!"" multiple times as an officer immediately pulled out his gun and fired repeated shots.

The girl then collapsed on the ground.

A police spokesperson said at a press conference that officers administered immediate CPR and aid ""as per policy.""

The police-involved shooting happened in Ohio just before Chauvin was found guilty on all counts in the death of George Floyd.

Cops have yet to reveal who the victim was – but she was identified by family as 16-year-old Ma'khia Bryant, WBNS reported.

Hazel Bryant, who said she is Ma'khia's aunt, said her niece called police because several adult women had come to the foster home where she was living and started an altercation with her, The Daily Beast reported.

She told The Columbus Dispatch that her niece got into an altercation with someone who lived at the home.

Hazel claimed that Ma'khia had a knife – and although she dropped it, she was shot multiple times, reports The Columbus Dispatch.

The alleged victim says she went to police after waking up next to the player, with a friend claiming she was not in “any state” to consent to sex, Daily Star Sunday reports.

The footballer has been accused of taking part in a “gang rape” at a rented flat with his friends.

The alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claims her drink was spiked and that she woke up next to the player.

The woman fears she was assaulted by “a number” of the player’s friends at a party during lockdown.

A friend of the woman says the alleged victim had no memory of events on the night other than having two drinks.

She said the woman was “acting strangely” and that her behaviour on the evening was “out of character”.



WOMAN CLAIMS DRINK WAS SPIKED

The alleged victim says that she woke up next to the football star the following morning with scratches on her legs, and asked him what had happened the previous night.

She claims the player, who was also naked, said that they had sex.

The friend told the Star: “She could barely stand the night before, there is no way she was in any state to consent to sex.”

The woman says she received an anonymous call on the day after the incident from someone who claimed that the player and his friends had spiked her drink at the party.

She says she then went to police and made the rape allegation.

The woman said she was interviewed by detectives and has been examined by forensic medical staff and doctors.

Stuart Jennings, 37, invited the victim to his house after chatting to her online and asked her to bring an overnight bag and ""slutty underwear"".

A court heard how after spending the evening together the pair started to have consensual sex which soon became ""rough and aggressive"".

Prosecutor Michael Hall said Jennings then started to choke and strangle the victim ""until she couldn't breathe"" while he told her: ""Call me daddy.""

Even though the woman said she wanted to drive home, ""manipulative"" Jennings stopped her and threatened to call the police as she had been drinking.

He then made her wear a dog collar, and when she wanted it removed, he claimed he had lost the screwdriver needed to do so.

During the night, while the victim was in bed next to him, he raped her.

The next morning she agreed to have sex again because she saw it as ""a way out"".

Jennings continued to force himself on the woman while repeatedly demanding anal intercourse, but she continued to say no during the terrifying ordeal.

'EXTREMELY DISTRESSING'

Wolverhampton Crown Court was told the offence happened while Jennings was on bail for a separate allegation of sexual assault.

Mr Hall said another woman had previously gone to Jennings' house and, while the pair were sitting watching TV, he started to make advances.

He made inappropriate comments, including demanding anal intercourse with her as ""that's what a man does to control a woman"".

He continued to make advances, pinning her down on the sofa while slapping her face, pulling her hair and biting her.

Jennings, of Belmont, Hereford, admitted rape, assault by penetration and sexual assault and was jailed for six years and 10 months last week.

Judge Martin Jackson told Jennings the woman he raped did not want anal sexual intercourse with him, but he carried on regardless.

Giles Nelson, defending, said that Jennings had ""behaved very badly"" and his actions were ""extremely distressing"" for the women.

He told the court his client was an ""intelligent and promising individual"" and was of previous good character.

Most famously, Evan Rachel Wood named Marilyn as her abuser in an Instagram post.

During the most recent episode of The Talk, Sharon opened up about her relationship of 25 years with the singer.

She told the women around her: ""[I’ve] worked with him for many, many years, and, obviously, I would not know what goes on in his bedroom; neither do I want to.

""But as far as people who’ve been going on all my socials, calling me names and things and putting up pictures of Marilyn and I, you know, there’s something called a working relationship, and that’s what I’ve had with Marilyn for many years.

""I know nothing about his sexual preferences or the way he treats women.

""I know how he treats an older woman, which is me, and he’s always been respectful.""

Marilyn has always been close to Sharon and her husband Ozzy Osbourne, and was even set to appear with him during his 2020 tour before it was canceled.

Sharon speaking about her relationship with Marilyn comes as several women have recounted horror experiences they had with the singer.

First was Evan, who joined by four other women, denounced Marilyn and claimed he abused her for years.

The 33-year-old Westworld actress took to Instagram in the early hours of Monday to reveal the identity of her alleged abuser.

She claimed: ""The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson.

""He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail.

""I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives.

""I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.""

Hours after she accused her ex of the abuse, Marilyn posted a statement on his Instagram denying the allegations.

He wrote: “Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.

“My intimate relationships have always been entire consensual with like-minded partners.

“Regardless of how - and why - others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.”

She had met Marilyn when she was just 18 years old and he was 36 and married to Dita Von Teese.

Following Evan's statement, other women came forward with similar allegations.

A stylist claimed that Marilyn held a gun to her head during a 2010 photoshoot.

Bailey, who is trans, also claimed Manson told her: ""I don't like f*****s"".

She reportedly first made the claims in social media posts in 2017, but repeated them in a video posted to Instagram this week.

The Sun also reported that it wasn't just sexual partners that the singer allegedly attacked, but also his mom.

The goth rocker admitted to hitting, spitting on, and trying to choke his mom, Barbara Warner, during violent outbursts in his youth.

Barbara died following a battle with dementia aged 68 in 2014.

Marilyn subsequently described his late mother as ""the first and greatest believer in me,"" adding: ""I’ll make you proud and satisfied that you know that you made the son you wanted.""

Singer Phoebe Bridgers also claimed that Marilyn ""bragged about having a 'rape room' in his home.""

The Motion Sickness singer claimed: ""TW: I went to Marilyn Manson’s house when I was a teenager with some friends. I was a big fan.

""He referred to a room in his house as the “r*pe room”, I thought it was just his horrible frat boy sense of humor. I stopped being a fan.""

""I stand with everyone who came forward,"" she said, before blasting his management and other alleged enablers of his behavior.

She claimed: ""The label knew, management knew, the band knew. Distancing themselves now, pretending to be shocked and horrified is f***ing pathetic.""

A court yesterday also heard the former Manchester City star, 37, ""attempted to deceive investigators"" with ""previously agreed facts"" surrounding his account of the 2013 gang rape.

The rape of the woman took place on her 23rd birthday at a Milan nightclub in 2013 while he was playing for Serie A giants AC Milan.

Robinho and five others were found guilty in 2017.

The footballer saw his sentence upheld in December but denied the charges and launched another appeal.

As reported by G1 Globo, the latest verdict of the Judges of Milan's Court of Appeal means the former Brazil international has 45 days to submit a final appeal to the Supreme Court, Italy's highest court of appeal.

No prison sentence will be served until all appeal processes are completed in Italy.

His friend Ricardo Falco also saw his charge upheld.

Robinho did admit to having 'contact' with the woman, but called it 'consensual'.

He claimed after he left, his friends also had consensual sexual intercourse with the woman - while adding he can't speak for them.

Key evidence used to convict the former Real Madrid star involved intercepted phone calls between Robinho and his friends.

It's claimed Robinho said the woman 'was completely drunk'.

But Robinho's legal team stated the messages were mistranslated into Italian.

In an interview, Robinho told Brazilian outlet UOL: ""A girl approached me, we started to have contact with her consent and mine too... then I went home.

""When she approached me, she wasn't drunk, because she remembers my name, she remembers who I am.

""The person who drinks doesn't remember anything. She remembers.""

Robinho did express remorse for his actions but said his only regret cheating on his wife Vivian, whom he married in 2009 and has two children with.

He added: ""I regret cheating on my wife. This is my regret.

""The question is, what was the mistake I made? What was the crime I did?

""The mistake was not being faithful to my wife. I didn't make any mistake of raping someone, of abusing some girl or go out with her without her consent.""

Robinho re-signed for boyhood club Santos in October on a tiny salary of just £50 per week two months after being released by Istanbul Basaksehir.

However, his deal was put on hold just two weeks later until the court case is concluded.

A club statement read: ""Santos and Robinho have by mutual agreement resolved to suspend the contract signed on 10 October so that the player can concentrate exclusively on his court defence in Italy.""

The club's shirt sponsor, Orthopride, also cancelled their contract with the club 'in respect to women who use our product'.",['Joshua Jones'],"ROBINHO ""brutally humiliated"" and ""belittled"" an Albanian woman he is convicted of raping - as his nine-year prison sentence was upheld.

The teenager was attacked by three men – including a former head of her village in India – when she took her little brother, 6, to use a local public toilet.

The community leader is now on the run, said officials, while the other two alleged attackers have been arrested for gang rape, wrongful confinement and criminal intimidation.

The trio of attackers – a 50-year-old former village head, and two men aged 22 and 18 – allegedly threatened to kill the terrified girl if she reported the attack in the village of Aliganj in Uttar Pradesh, around 140 miles south east of Delhi.

Undeterred by the threats to her life, the girl told her family, who tried to report the gang rape to police after it happened on Monday.

'TURNED AWAY' BY POLICE

The family allege they were turned away by police for two days, before complaining to the human rights organisation the Bhim Army, which raised the girl’s treatment with a local district magistrate.

When local media asked police about the delay, Aliganj police station house officer Pankaj Kumar Mishra claimed they had not received a complaint, reported Times of India.

“We received the complaint on Wednesday and registered a case against the three men under punishment for gang rape, punishment for wrongful confinement, punishment for voluntarily causing hurt, intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace, punishment for criminal intimidation, and the SC/ST Act,” he said.

The SC/ST Act – also known as the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act – is supposed to prevent exploitation and sexual violence against people from lower social castes in India.

The alleged gang rape is the latest in a wave of attacks on young girls from India’s Dalit community – formerly known as ‘untouchables’ – who are at the bottom of the country’s strict caste hierarchy.

The group has traditionally been physically and socially excluded from mainstream society, and faced discrimination in all parts of their life.

In India, it is not possible to move between different ‘castes’.

WAVE OF ATTACKS

In September, protests erupted after a 20-year-old Dalit woman died from her injuries from being gang-raped by four upper caste men while she was out working in the fields.

Just two days after her death, a 22-year-old woman from the same caste was allegedly raped, tortured and murdered by two men on her way home from work.

In September, a 13-year-old Dalit girl was raped and killed in Uttar Pradesh.

Prison sentences for rapists were doubled to 20 years as well as well as criminalising voyeurism, stalking and trafficking of women.

A cop said the suspects - all of whom have ""confessed"" - assumed the unconscious girls, aged 14 and 15, had died after the ""night-long"" attack.

The victims were allegedly gang-raped in Khowai, Tripura, on Monday by eight men aged from 19-22, reports Times of India.

The teens had celebrated Holi with them before the alleged gang-rape in the Baribari area of Champahaor.

A police spokesman told reporters at Northeast Today: “The girls knew the boys, so they did not hesitate to go with them.

“The accused took the girls to a forest and gang-raped them through the night.

""When they passed out, the men left, presuming them to be dead.""

Despite their severe trauma and injuries, the girls ""somehow managed to make it home"", the Times adds.

Their parents went straight to the police to report the attack.

The victims were admitted to GBP Hospital in Agartala and Khowai District Hospital, and are both currently undergoing treatment.

Dr Kiran Kumar told reporters both girls were out of danger.

The police spokesman said the accused rapists, Jagu Debbarma, Bimal Debbarma, Michael Debbarma, Hrishit Debbarma, Nishit Debbarma, Soyel Debbarma, Biresh Debbarma and Bikash Debbarma remain in custody.

They are to make their first court appearance next Wednesday.

The vile alleged attack comes a month after Oxfam India accused the government of spending a ""grossly inadequate"" sum of money to combat violence against women and girls.

Nearly a decade has passed since the gang rape and murder of a student on a bus shocked India.

Public outrage over her death led to legislators passing tough new laws against sexual violence, including the death penalty for rape in some cases.

Prison sentences for rapists were doubled to 20 years as well as well as criminalising voyeurism, stalking and trafficking of women.

RAPE EVERY 15 MINUTES

Funds earmarked for setting up helplines, opening crisis centres and introducing gender-sensitisation training for officials remain unspent, the charity said.

It shared its findings after analysing the country's budgetary commitment to boosting women's safety.

Oxfam's Towards Violence Free Lives For Women report noted that a rape takes place every 15 minutes in the country of 1.3billion.

For the 80million women and girls who suffer sexual violence, the budget allocation reached just 102 rupees (70p) per head.

""That is grossly inadequate,"" said Amita Pitre, lead specialist for gender justice at Oxfam India.

Almost 34,000 rape cases were reported in 2018, about the same as the previous year.

Just over 85 per cent led to charges and 27 per cent of complaints to convictions, according to government crime data.

Days ago, The Sun reported on an eight-year-old schoolgirl being allegedly raped in a dumpster and offered 5p as a bribe to keep the horrific attack secret in India.

In ""deep shock"", the eight-year-old girl went home crying to her grandma and told her of the attack, said a top cop in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh.

Grant Townsend, 26, was found dead by his mum at their home in Hull, Humberside on June 6 last year.

He had battled mental health for a number of years.

Hull Coroner's Court heard he had intended to take his own life after struggling following a false allegation of rape against him.

Mr Townsend was acquitted at a trial.

His mum Keely Gillbey told the inquest her son feared ""the title of rapist would never go away"" even though he'd been found innocent.

'DETERIORATE'

His mental health got worse from 2017 after the false allegation, Ms Gillbey said.

She said: ""He was found not guilty - it took them less than 10 minutes for all of them to come back with a not guilty verdict.

""But it affected Grant in a big, big way, especially knowing what I had gone through as a child.

""To be accused of that affected him big time, it really did. I watched him deteriorate.""

He was found not guilty, but it affected Grant in a big, big way, Keely Gillbey

The inquest also heard he had ""found it difficult to leave the house"" and insisted he was fine, even though Ms Gillbey found a suicide note declaring his innocence.

They didn't discuss the note, but she believes he knew she found it as she threw away tablets that were in his room.

Mr Townsend had started a relationship with a woman a short time later, the court heard.

""They got a house together but they did have problems"", Ms Gillbey told the inquest.

'SOBBED'

Mr Townsend was kicked out of their home after problems with the couple getting jobs.

Ms Gillbey said: ""The day he came home he sobbed and he could barely go outside and was fed up with everything.""

The inquest heard he was ""crying himself to sleep"".

He had also struggled to come to terms with abuse his mum suffered and his uncle's death and was teased about his accent after moving from Kent to Hull when he was a schoolboy.

YOU'RE NOT ALONE EVERY 90 minutes in the UK a life is lost to suicide. It doesn't discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society - from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers. It's the biggest killer of people under the age of 35, more deadly than cancer and car crashes. And men are three times more likely to take their own life than women. Yet it's rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now. That is why The Sun launched the You're Not Alone campaign. The aim is that by sharing practical advice, raising awareness and breaking down the barriers people face when talking about their mental health, we can all do our bit to help save lives. Let's all vow to ask for help when we need it, and listen out for others... You're Not Alone.

On June 6, Ms Gillbey came downstairs around 5.30am to find her son sleeping on the sofa.

Ms Gillbey revealed the phone conversation they had after she arrived at work, where Mr Townsend asked if his dog had ""settled"" the night before.

Speaking after the inquest, Ms Gillbey said: ""His dog Kilo was his life.He absolutely worshipped him.

""I think that's why when I spoke to him in the morning, I should have clicked then that something wasn't right because he kept asking me 'did the dog settle with you last night' and whether or not 'the dog was definitely alright with you mum, definitely, definitely alright'.""

'LOVEABLE ROGUE'

Ms Gillbey found her son's body after returning home from work.

Neighbours battled to save him life by performing CPR, but paramedics confirmed he had died.

Paying tribute to her son, Ms Gillbey said: ""He was a bit of a loveable rogue. To look at him, to meet him, you wouldn't know that anything was wrong.

""Knowing that inside his head was turmoil, his face never showed it.

""I think that goes for a lot of men that are suffering out there, they all walk around out there with a smile on their face.""

Coroner Michael Mellun ruled Mr Townsend's death was suicide.

He said: ""Not only did he die through his own actions but he did intend to die, taking into account that he had been suffering from anxiety and depression and the allegation of rape still weighed heavily above him.""

Cops swooped on a man, 50, in Cheshire nearly 20 years after Stuart was found in a pool at the TV star’s Essex mansion.

Officers are set to contact Barrymore, 68, today.

He is said to be “relieved” by the arrest and hopes it will bring the family closure.

The terminally-ill dad of Stuart Lubbock yesterday told of his last wish to get justice for his tragic son.

Terry Lubbock, 76, spoke as police arrested a man, 50, on suspicion of murder over the 2001 death.

Terry, who has cancer and months to live, said: “This has been my life for the past 20 years.

“I’ve not got long left now, the cancer is through my body and I can’t do anything about it.

“I’m just pleased there’s been an arrest.

“I just want justice for my boy, that’s all I’ve ever wanted since this happened.”

'I HOPE IT'S ALL OVER BEFORE I DIE'

He added: “I’ve had false dawns before. I’ve had my hopes up, then dashed.

“I just want this to be the breakthrough.

“There’s not a day when it’s not with me.

“I hope it’s all over before I die.”

The dramatic arrest was made in Cheshire early yesterday, with the suspect quizzed in custody. Last night he was released on bail until April 12.

Mr Lubbock, who lives in a care home in Harlow, Essex, and Barrymore, 68, were both informed of the developments.

Police acted on new information following The Sun’s doubling of the reward to £40,000 last year — in conjunction with a new appeal and Channel 4 documentary about the death of Stuart, 31.

Mike Browne, the star’s agent from 1984 to 2003, said: “I’ve spoken with Michael about the arrest.

“He just kept saying, ‘Let’s hope this time the police have enough evidence to charge someone for Stuart’s murder’.

“Michael is just hoping that with this arrest and, maybe some new evidence, Stuart’s family can finally get some closure.

“All they want to know is how Stuart was injured and how he died. They have lost a son and deserve answers. That’s what Michael wants above all else as well.

“The theory is that someone came forward because of the reward.”

Investigators believe one of the eight party guests holds the key to the death on March 31, 2001.

Barrymore invited them to his £2million home in Roydon, Essex, following a night out in Harlow.

Police said all eight will be contacted following the new developments with action expected as soon as today.

Yesterday, the guests refused to speak to The Sun, including Barrymore’s ex-lover Jonathan Kenney.

We revealed last year Mr Kenney tells anyone who asks that he “had a good time” at the party.

Arrest comes after significant new information came to light following offer of enhanced reward Det Supt Lucy Morris

Another guest, Kelly Campbell, said yesterday: “I’m not going to talk about the case or the arrest.”

Kylie Merritt, 38, James Futers, 43, and Claire Jones, 37, declined to comment.

Det Supt Lucy Morris, from the Essex force, said earlier yesterday: “The man who was arrested in Cheshire continues to be questioned by our detectives.

“Following the arrest, we immediately notified the Lubbock family.

“This arrest is almost 20 years to the day in which Stuart was found unconscious in a swimming pool, following a party at a home in Roydon. He later died in hospital.

“The arrest comes after significant new information came to light following our renewed appeal for information and offer of an enhanced reward which coincided with a major TV documentary broadcast in February 2020.

“Over the coming days, we will be contacting all those who were at the party at the time, as well as others who may have information.

“As we stated last February — and have continually stated over the last 20 years — we believe someone, or some people, at that party know what happened.

“It is important to re-state the fact that Essex Police has never given up on this case and that the force is motivated by the desire to deliver justice for Mr Lubbock and his family.

“Stuart’s rape and murder has been an extremely lengthy and complex investigation which has spanned over 20 years.

“We have never given up on finding out exactly what happened to Stuart, and we will not stop in our pursuit of justice for him and for his family and friends.

“As we have said repeatedly over the last 20 years, nine people were at that party.

“We know that not everyone was responsible for what happened, but someone was.

'NOW IS THE TIME TO COME FORWARD'

“Now is the time to come forward if you haven’t done so already, to set this matter to rest by providing us with any information you have.”

Former Strike It Lucky quiz host Barrymore and his guests have always denied involvement — maintaining Stuart was drunk and high, and drowned accidentally.

A pool thermometer and a missing shed handle are believed to be important parts of the investigation.

Barrymore’s career collapsed after the tragedy.

He briefly made a comeback in 2006’s Celebrity Big Brother, finishing runner-up to Chantelle Houghton.

A broken hand forced him out of Dancing on Ice in January last year.

The investigation gathered momentum ahead of Channel 4’s Barrymore: The Body in the Pool, aired in February 2020.

For the first time, the show featured the 999 call reporting the death. A man was heard saying: “A fella has drowned in the pool.

“We have got them out. There’s a party going on and someone has just gone out and found him.”

He added: “I tell you what mate, the first time I’ve been out in four f***ing years. I have me kids every weekend and f***ing hell. I think the geezer’s dead, mate.”

Essex Police Det Chief Insp Stephen Jennings welcomed The Sun’s decision to double the reward last year saying: “It’s never too late to do the right thing.”

Max Ronaldson launched a campaign of harassment against the victim after following her in Balham Hill, south west London, on January 25.

3 Max Ronaldson targeted the same woman three times as she walked in London

The 25-year-old hurled abuse at the woman and threatened to break into her home and rape her during the nightmare ordeal.

He also targeted her two other times in the same area - including one occasion on February 12 where he yelled at her again.

Thankfully two members of the public stepped in to help and the fiend fled.

Eleven days later, Ronaldson was following the woman and started making offensive remarks again when she whipped out her phone and began taking photos.

These images were given to police who managed to hunt down the sicko and arrest him.

Ronaldson has now been jailed for six weeks after admitting threatening behaviour likely to cause harassment alarm or distress and a charge of causing harassment without violence.

'UNWANTED AND UNPLEASANT'

Detective Constable Richard Roberts, of South West CID, said: “We take this kind of behaviour very seriously.

“The victim was simply walking along the street when she was subjected to unwanted and unpleasant harassment. She had the strength of character to challenge this outrageous behaviour and to report it to the police.

“When she was harassed again, she was calm and had the presence of mind to take photos of the man which helped the investigation enormously.

“I would urge anyone being targeted to immediately report it as this type of behaviour is unacceptable and it is a criminal offence. Your report will be taken seriously and investigated as far as the evidence will take us.

""This will help us to take offenders like Ronaldson off the streets of London and make our city a safer place for all.”

The creep, from Clapham Common South Side, targeted the victim close to where tragic Sarah Everard vanished on March 3.

The 33-year-old marketing manager was walking home from a friend's house in Clapham Common when she disappeared.

Now, Hammer's ex-girlfriend - Paige Lorenze - has claimed the actor's own mother warned her that her son was ""demonic"".

Who is Armie Hammer's ex-girlfriend Paige Lorenze?

Paige Lorenze was born on January 26, 1998, in Guilford, Connecticut.

Lorenze, a model, has over 100,000 followers on Instagram, and over 19,000 subscribers on her YouTube channel.

She mostly posts lifestyle content, and has recently increased her social media numbers since she was spotted with Hammer.

The 23-year-old model and Hammer were dating four months in 2020.

Hammer has been seen with a few women since announcing his separation from his wife Elizabeth Chambers, whom he was married to for 10 years.

Lorenze is a student at the Parsons School of Design in New York City.

What did Lorenze claim Hammer's mother told her about her son?

Lorenze has come out and claimed that Hammer's own mother, Dru Ann, warned her her son was ""demonic"" and that he had a ""very, very dark side"".

The college student talked about his mother in a clip from her appearance on The Dr Oz Show on Friday, February 19.

Dr Mehmet Oz asked her if Hammer's mom or other ""members of the family heard things about him"".

She responded: “Well, she never specifically said anything to me because I don’t think she wanted to assume.""

Lorenze added: ""But she literally just said things like, ‘he has demonic behaviors, the devil was trying to take him,’ things like that.

""I didn’t grow up extremely religious, so that was a little bit out of touch for me, but I did get a feeling from her like she knew that he had a very, very dark side.”

What did Lorenze allege Hammer wanted to do to her?

Lorenze has previously claimed the disgraced actor wanted to remove her bottom ribs so he could eat them, and that he carved the letter ""A"" into her pubic bone.

In January, she alleged that Hammer was ""100 per cent"" serious about finding a doctor to remove her bottom ribs.

""He was telling me you can remove the bottom ribs so he could smoke them, cook them and eat them. He kept saying, 'You don't need them,'"" she told Star Magazine.

The model said she laughed it off but felt ""anxious and confused"" as a result of his alleged behavior.

She also claimed Hammer carved his initial above her pubic bone in an ""extremely painful"" act and later bragged about it to his friends.

In January 2021, Lorenze claimed the actor kept mannequins in the basement of his family home to learn to tie up women and talked about wanting to strangle his dog, The Sun exclusively reported

She claims he was obsessed with ""meat, bones and veins,"" and wanted her to be proud of the bruises she sustained as a result of rough BDSM sessions.

""He told me that he had mannequins in his basement in his family home that Elizabeth and him were living at to practice rope tying on,"" Paige told The Sun.

""It creeped me out, honestly. It was really strange. I'd never even heard of anything like that before.

""I'm not trying to kink shame at all. But I think that dangerous men [sometimes] use this as like a smoke screen for abusing and hurting women for their own sexual pleasure.

""I am holding him accountable and I think he knows that he's caused a lot of women pain, even if he doesn't want to admit it right now. And there is power in numbers.""

She added: ""I think that this [situation] is terrible, it's so unfair on his children and I think everyone is just so disgusted and shocked.""

In a Vanity Fair expose published in March, she told the magazine that during her relationship with Hammer she felt ""really unsafe and sick to her stomach.""

In January, Hammer was accused of sending disturbing messages about cannibalism, rape fantasies, having ""slaves"" and ""drinking blood"" as a number of women came forward.

Following the allegations, he released a statement: ""I’m not responding to these bulls**t claims but in light of the vicious and spurious online attacks against me, I cannot in good conscience now leave my children for 4 months to shoot a film in the Dominican Republic.""

He has since dropped out of the film, Shotgun Wedding, following the controversy.",['Israel Salas-Rodriguez'],"Now, Hammer's ex-girlfriend - Paige Lorenze - has claimed the actor's own mother warned her that her son was ""demonic"".

The pair first fought in 1989 before rematching in 1996 - both of which were brutally won by Tyson.

But Bruno, 59, claims the pair are bound together by brotherly love after he flew to meet him in America for a new Sky documentary.

It came just a month after Tyson made his remarkable comeback aged 54 as he boxed to a draw with fellow legend Roy Jones Jr, 54, in Iron Mike's first fight since retiring 15 years prior.

Bruno was cheering his former foe on all the way, and here SunSport details how their careers compared.

MIKE TYSON

Even before turning pro, Tyson was making a name for himself as a teenager with strength way before his years under the guidance of iconic mentor Cus D'Amato.

By the time he made his debut aged 18, he was already one of the most feared fighters in the world and racked up 27 wins - with only two going the distance - before challenging for the title in record time.

Tyson in 1986 became the youngest heavyweight champion of all time as he knocked out Trevor Berbick at the age of 20 years and 145 days.

But the life as Baddest Man on The Planet would later catch up on Iron Mike, who made nine defences of his belt before succumbing to the sport's most famous upset.

In 1990, Tyson, while partying and taking drugs the night before, was KO'd by American outsider James 'Buster' Douglas in Tokyo, Japan, sending shockwaves around the world.

His prime athletic years were lost to addiction and a three-year prison term, started in 1992, for a rape he still fiercely denies.

But when he came out in 1995, it took him only a year to reclaim the WBC title, as he savagely KO'd Bruno, who had reigned as champ for just six months.

In the years following, he lost to Evander Holyfield twice - the second time after biting his rival's ear - was KO'd by Lennox Lewis before retiring after two dismal defeats.

Amazingly, after the success of Tyson's Hotboxin' podcast, launched in 2017, he stopped drinking and using cocaine putting him in line for a comeback.

And after he began dramatically transforming his body in early 2020, he returned in the November and now has his sights set on a trilogy with Holyfield.

FRANK BRUNO

Bruno made his debut in 1982 and it took him four years and 30 fights until he challenged for the world title, later losing to Tim Witherspoon in 1986.

In his next attempt, three years on, he was wiped out in round five against Tyson, the first of the series, before losing to Lennox Lewis in 1993, his third try at the belt.

He finally achieved his goal in the fourth and final attempt as he outpointed America's Oliver McCall in 1995, leaving the nation on its feet.

Britain's favourite heavyweight champion walked away from the ring in 1996, coincidently after losing to Tyson.

The Brit legend has never looked close to a comeback but remained in boxing, and in great shape, by helping rising stars at his former amateur club, the Peacock.

The former champ last year was the padman for prospect Daniel Dubois at an open workout in London.

Despite fans wanting Bruno to stay happily retired, it can't be denied the MBE looks in great shape.

A spokesman for Cuomo claimed that both departures were scheduled for some time and that Hammond was leaving to ""focus on her family"" while Boldison was taking a new position at the state university system.

On Thursday allegations of a toxic work environment were made by Cuomo's staffers who alleged they were told to ""wear heels when he's around"" and some claimed he would fire people on the spot in anger.

Earlier this week another member of Cuomo's staff Gareth Rhodes, resigned just days after a guest at his wedding came forward with allegations that Cuomo sexually harassed her at the reception in September 2019.

Rhodes wrote in a prepared statement: ""Last week as I approached one year since moving to Albany to join the NYS Covid task force, I decided it was time, given the progress of the vaccination program and continued decline of Covid numbers, to return to my previous role at the Department of Financial Services and I informed the Governor’s senior staff at the time.""

A spokesman in Cuomo's press office, Will Burns, announced his departure on the same day hat same day, so he could prepare to take the entrance exams for law school.

After two years Cuomo’s press secretary Caitlin Girouard is also resigning after she accepted a position in a technology firm in January, according to the New York Post.

Meanwhile, the New York Senate has voted to revoke Gov Andrew Cuomo's executive authority powers amid the nursing home deaths scandal and the sexual harassment claims.

Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins called for ""increased oversight"" in a statement after the vote, CNN reported.

It comes as one of Gov. Cuomo's accusers, Charlotte Bennett recently branded him a ""textbook abuser"" who ""let his temper rule the office"", during an interview with CBS Evening News.

""He lets his temper and his anger rule the office, but he was very sweet to me for a year in the hopes that maybe one day, when he came onto me, I would think we were friends or that it was appropriate or that it was okay.,"" she alleged.

According to local reports, Olga invited Zhdanov to her place after they got acquainted in a local grocery store.

After the pair consumed some alcoholic drinks, Zhdanov reportedly became aggressive and Olga asked him to leave.

In response, he allegedly grabbed a kitchen knife and violently stabbed the woman to death.

After that, Zhdanov reportedly broke into the room of Olga’s daughter and raped her, before strangling her with the cord of a power iron.

The victims’ bodies were found the next day by Olga’s mother, after she came over to celebrate her birthday as the family had planned.

Only now, two years after the crime, the suspect has been identified by DNA analysis.

And police have now launched a criminal case against Zhdanov, who is currently serving a six-year sentence for car theft.

According to reports from local authorities, the man has confessed to killing the mother and the girl.

The series focuses on forensic psychiatrist Dr Emma Robertson and her dangerous relationship with her patient Connie Mortensen, a woman accused of a terrible crime she has no memory of ever committing.

Connie is a wife and mother suffering from dissociative amnesia — or at least seems to be.

It is up to Emma to decide whether Connie can stand trial for her sins.

Dr Robertson is tasked with investigating the truth surrounding Connie’s relationship with her best friend, Ness — a relationship that somehow caused Connie to attempt to murder a loved one.

The twisted tale depicts Connie as a masterful manipulator, unearthing Emma's past traumas and pains.

In a weekend TV appearance, Oxford-educated Khan, 68, advised women to cover up to prevent temptation for men who lacked ""willpower"".

Khan, one of the best cricketers of all time, said the ""rapid"" increase in rape cases indicated the ""consequences in any society where vulgarity is on the rise"".

""This entire concept of purdah is to avoid temptation, not everyone has the willpower to avoid it,"" he said, using a term which can refer to modest dress or the segregation of the sexes.

Hundreds have now signed a statement calling Khan's comments ""factually incorrect, insensitive and dangerous"".

""Fault rests solely with the rapist and the system that enables the rapist, including a culture fostered by statements such as those made by Khan,"" the statement said.

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan - an independent rights watchdog - said it was ""appalled"" by the comments.

""Not only does this betray a baffling ignorance of where, why and how rape occurs, but it also lays the blame on rape survivors, who, as the government must know, can range from young children to victims of honour crimes,"" it said.

Much of Pakistan lives under an ""honour"" code where women who bring ""shame"" on the family can be subjected to violence or murder.

It is a deeply conservative country where victims of sexual abuse are often viewed with suspicion and cases are rarely seriously investigated.

During the interview on live television at the weekend, Khan also blamed divorce rates in the UK on the ""sex, drugs and rock and roll"" culture which began in the 1970s - when the twice-divorced Khan was gaining a reputation in London as a playboy.

He has been linked to a roll call of glamorous beauties, including Stephanie Beacham, Goldie Hawn, Kristiane Backer, Susannah Constantine and Marie Helvin – while he also counted Princess Diana as a friend.

The batsman-turned-politician himself had said meeting women was chief among ""the very decadent pleasures in life"" which he enjoyed.

In 1995, he married glamorous socialite Jemima Goldsmith and the couple had two sons before they split in 2004, which was in part attributed to the difficulties she faced in Pakistan where she was hounded for her Jewish ancestry.

Khan's second marriage to former BBC newsreader Reham Khan lasted just nine months in 2015.

He married his current wife, Bushra Wattoo, in a conservative ceremony in 2018, and revealed how did not see her face until after they wed.

Last year, Khan was criticised after failing to challenge a Muslim cleric's insistence that Covid had been unleashed because of the wrongdoings of women.

And nationwide protests also erupted after a police chief reprimanded a gang-rape victim for driving at night without a male companion.

The Franco-Pakistani mother was assaulted in front of her children on the side of a motorway after her car ran out of fuel.

Khan's latest controversy comes as the organisers behind International Women's Day marches face what they have called a ""coordinated disinformation campaign"" against them.

It has led to blasphemy accusations - a hugely sensitive issue in Pakistan where allegations have previously led mobs to attack people.

The organisers of the annual march have called for the prime minister to intervene.

In her first interview since it was suggested Pauline had fallen out with the BBC1 show’s stars, Linda said they are still friends.

There had been an alleged face-off with Lesley Joseph outside TV studio toilets.

Linda, 63, who has played Tracey Stubbs since 1989, also insists the only reason Pauline, 61, missed last year’s Christmas special of the show was because she wanted to step away from the limelight.

Addressing the “irreconcilable feud”, she told The Sun on Sunday: “Take no notice of what you’ve heard about me and Pauline falling out. It’s a load of old codswallop.

“Pauline just chose not to do Birds Of A Feather. She wants to concentrate on her acting academy, that’s that.

CHILDHOOD FRIENDS

“We’ve known each other since we were ten. We’re friends. Will Pauline return to the show? I don’t know.

“I just know that the Christmas special went down really well. ITV were really, really pleased.”

Pauline, who played Tracey’s sister Sharon Theodopolopodous in the hit comedy, and Linda were childhood best friends.

The Londoners met at Islington’s Anna Scher Theatre School in the late Sixties and first appeared on TV together in Pauline’s Quirkes in the mid-Seventies.

But it was Birds Of A Feather, which once attracted 15million viewers a week, for which the pair became most well known.

Yet in February there were claims that their relationship had broken down after an alleged bust-up on set at the Teddington studios. The row was said to be why Pauline refused to take part in the 30th anniversary show in 2019 and the Christmas special a year later. Linda refutes this.

The telly favourite who has launched new podcast Growing Bolder, which celebrates life after 50, is also close to co-star Lesley, 75, who plays snooty Dorien Green.

Linda said: “She is great. Lesley lives close to me in Wandsworth so I’d go with my husband and we leave things on her doorstep.

6 Lesley Joseph has cropped Pauline Quirke out of pictures with Linda

“It’s mostly funny things like lady’s tweezers to pluck the hair on her chin, them sort of things, funny things.

“And then some flowers and that. But Pauline lives in Buckinghamshire so it’s not as easy to get to hers. I’ve not left any funny things on her doorsteps.”

Linda has been married to Mark Dunford since 1990 and they share daughter Roberta, 25, and son Louis, 29. She also has daughter Lauren, 38, from a previous relationship.

Since 2012 she has been a regular panellist on ITV1 hit daytime show Loose Women.

We’ve known each other since we were ten. We

are friends. Will Pauline return to the show? I don’t know

She said: “My nickname is either Nanny Linda or Baggy Mouth because I always say things how I see them.

“Sometimes I get into trouble for it but I always tell the truth. It really is like a family. We’re all there for each other and that’s what I like about being on the show.

“We’ve always got each other’s backs if anything goes wrong, or anything is said that we shouldn’t have said.” Linda credits her Loose Women pals with saving her life after co-star Stacey Solomon rushed her back to London from a girls’ trip in Ibiza in 2018 so she could enter rehab. Linda had turned to alcohol to help her cope with anxiety, and later said she had felt like she wanted to die.

6 The Sun's story on the Birds of a Feather trio

She believes her anxiety stems from 2008, when her son Louis’ friend Ben Kinsella was stabbed to death while the pair had been out celebrating their GCSEs. The 16-year-old’s murder led to anti-knife crime demonstrations in the capital and a review of knife crime sentencing laws.

On her breakdown, Linda recalled: “All the Loose Women were so supportive.

“We were in Ibiza, sort of had a breakdown and Stacey flew home with me early. All of the Loose Women were great. The whole time I wasn’t, so they were ringing all the time. A few of them came to see me and that, so yeah, it was really nice they’ve been brilliant.

“I’ve managed to stay positive in lockdown and I keep busy. Just being able to go to a supermarket to get out of the house, go shopping, that’s been a lifesaver really.

Lesley lives close to me. I leave things on her doorstep like tweezers to pluck the hair on her chin...and flowers



“I’ve cleaned every cupboard. I’ve run out of things to do now. It hasn’t tipped over into how it was before.”

One strange rumour about Loose Women alleged that two of its hosts were more than just pals.

Linda said: “Never in a million years. I don’t know anyone that could be. Everyone is happily married.

“Put it this way, I’ve not noticed any of the other Loose Women looking at me in a particular way.” The show even led to one bizarre encounter with Elton John after Linda had a “sexy dream” about the superstar.

She said: “Loose Women throws up some unlikely meetings. One day I woke up and felt really ashamed because I’d had a sexy dream about Elton.

“I was thinking, ‘I hope my husband Mark doesn’t find out’. It felt so real.

“One of our make-up ladies knows Elton and, because she was going to see him, I sent a note saying, ‘Dear Elton, I just read your book and I loved Rocket Man as well. Do you remember the night we spent together on the Eurostar?”

“A few days later, to my surprise, he wrote back saying, ‘Dear Linda. It wasn’t the Eurostar. It was the Orient Express and we made so much noise they chucked us off’.

“He’s got a great sense of humour. I never expected him to write back, never in a million years.”

While she is still a Loose Woman, Linda is also enjoying her sideline with the Growing Bolder podcast. One episode was about her plucking up the courage to go skydiving. She said: “I’ve done more in my sixties than I did in my fifties. We talk about interesting people and what it’s like getting older and bolder.”

But Linda hasn’t ruled out more acting and is eyeing up one of the biggest shows on telly. She said: “I’d like to do some more drama, too. I acted for years and years, but since Loose Women I’ve become more of a celebrity than an actress so there’s not been many offers. I’d love to do some.

Clement Omoregbee, 35, was charged after the string of assaults unfolded over almost two years across the capital.

The man, of Greenwich, was arrested after cops launched a manhunt over the attacks in East London.

The first assault unfolded on 19 February, 2019, with Met Police called to reports of a rape on Shoreditch High Street.

The victim did not support an investigation however, and no further action was taken.

Met Police said a second offence was reported on December 6 last year - with a woman telling officers she had been raped the night before in the Shoreditch area.

Cops launched a probe - arresting the suspect on March 2, this year.

However, the man has also been linked to a third rape that allegedly took place in Shoreditch in September 2020.

The victim was said to have been assaulted in Shoreditch, with the suspect arrested on April 21 this year.

Met Police today confirmed Omoregbee had been charged with rape over the attacks.

He appeared at Thames Magistrates Court today and was bailed.

As part of his bail conditions, he is not allowed to go into the London Borough of Hackney, must abide by a curfew and wear a tag.

Anisah Ahmed, 33, set up an ""evil"" campaign of lies and falsely claimed she was raped as well as staging her own kidnapping and stabbing, a judge heard.

2 Barrister Iqbal Mohammed, pictured, was framed by Ahmed after she found out he was married Credit: Hyde News & Pictures Ltd

The twisted plot began in 2014 when the qualified barrister found out her lover, fellow barrister Iqbal Mohammed, was married.

She then reported Mr Mohammed, 38, had ""raped her on several occasions"" and her complaint was ""detailed and convincing"" - even though it was completely false, the court heard.

Sitting at Oxford Crown Court, Judge Michael Gledhill QC gave her a discretionary life sentence with a minimum term of four years, six months and 10 days.

He said: ""It appears that Ahmed had no idea that Mohammed was married.

“When she found out, she felt utterly betrayed and took her revenge by putting into effect a comprehensive and orchestrated plan to destroy him – both professionally and personally.""

'FATAL ATTRACTION FILM PLOT'

After seeing her jailed, Mr Mohammed said he believed he was targeted following his BBC documentary debut and explained that the dark harassment he faced was comparable with the movie ""Fatal Attraction.""

He said: ""I can’t put into words what it was like. I saw Fatal Attraction a couple of years ago but I couldn’t watch it because it was just like what happened to me, it was like the life that I lived.

""There was no enjoyment or entertainment in it because it was scary to see this sort of thing in a film because I had lived it.

""It started off as harassment which was frustrating and then it became really dangerous and dark and really scary, frightening.

“I would never have thought the judge would pass a life sentence, I think most people would think that’s crazy because she hasn’t killed anyone but I do not think anyone would realise the depths of what she did.

I can’t put into words what it was like. I saw Fatal Attraction a couple of years ago but I couldn’t watch it because it was just like what happened to me, it was like the life that I lived."" Victim Iqbal Mohammed

“We met socially through LinkedIn. She worked in a law firm in Oxford but we met and started flirting and that is how it started.

The court heard how the sophisticated campaign of ruin began when Ahmed, from Oxford, sent intimate messages of their affair to the victim's wife and his colleagues.

She then emailed his Head of Chambers demanding an investigation into his integrity, the court was told.

It then took a more sinister turn when she created fake emails to support her false claims which made it look like they were sent by the victim threatening her, amounting to ""blackmail.""

Victim Mr Mohammed was then publicly arrested at his barrister chambers before he was taken to a police station and locked in a cell for seven hours, the judge heard.

'EVIL' PLOT

After Mr Mohammed’s chambers instructed IT experts to search the chambers' computers, they discovered that the email evidence had been falsified and police arrested Ahmed for harassment.

She later admitted that she had created the fake emails but persisted in the lie that Mr Mohammed was still harassing her.

When it was decided to prosecute Ahmed for harassment, far from stopping her campaign of destruction - she escalated it.

Judge Gledhill QC added: ""As a barrister, Ahmed was well aware of the gravity of what she had done and the potential consequences to herself.

“In order to avoid such consequences, her strategy then took an even more sinister turn.

Being wrongly accused of harassment is serious enough. But accusing him of rape is in quite another category."" Judge Michael Gledhill QC

“She reported that he had raped her on several occasions. Her complaint was detailed and convincing, even though it was completely false.

""Her purpose was twofold – revenge and to divert the police attention away from herself and back onto Mr Mohammed.

""The effect on Mr Mohammed can hardly be overstated. He saw his career, livelihood and family life disintegrating before his eyes, he even thought of taking his own life.""

Iestyn Morgan, prosecuting, told Judge Gledhill: “It was a complex and baroque conspiracy to convince the police that Mr Mohammed was pursuing her, threatening her, arranging others to threaten her, threatening to kill her and inflict really serious violence on her.""

'MALICIOUS'

As her harassment trial approached, Ahmed became increasingly desperate and hatched a plan to stage her own kidnapping and stabbing.

Balraj Bhatia QC, defending, said: ""She is clearly a manipulative woman.

“She has an inability to cope with rejection and feelings of betrayal but it is likely this behaviour is a coping mechanism as a result of her diagnosis of emotionally unstable personality disorder.

“It is very much like the young child who cried wolf, she is now a woman who was driven to concoct false allegations of rape and has been found out. She has made herself vulnerable to future abuse.""

In his sentencing remarks, Judge Gledhill said: ""Your actions, Ms Ahmed, were malicious, even evil.

Women both in and outside London took to social media to share their anger and upset for her family, after the 33-year-old disappeared while walking home.

Presenter and voiceover artist Kavita Kukar, 33, who lives in Brixton and regularly meets her friends around Clapham Common, often walks the same route Sarah was last seen taking.

Here, she reveals her shock and calls for more to be done to make women feel safe on the street.

She says: ""We all know that panicked feeling as we repeatedly scan the area around us, clutching our key in our clenched fist, desperate to see our front door.

It’s become all too normal for women to feel that chilling fear and take endless precautions for a simple walk home, texting or calling our friends, crossing the street when someone gets too close, always being on guard.

In 2021, it shouldn’t be like this.

Worries over the pandemic overtook some of those fears recently. That is, until last week, when 33-year-old Sarah Everard disappeared on a street I myself walk down regularly.

I’ve lived in Brixton my whole life and I walk around Clapham Common all the time, often walking home alone and feeling safe because there’s so many people and so many lights.

Sarah did everything right – she called her boyfriend, he knew where she was going, she was wearing bright clothes, she took the main roads.

12 Urgent pleas for help in finding Sarah have been sent out over the last week Credit: PA:Press Association

It was just her normal walk home and she took all the right steps to keep herself safe.

When I saw the latest news, I burst into tears. All of a sudden itfelt like we’d all lost somebody close to us – we could all relate to her, she’s all of us in that terrible moment.

But for me, one particularly shocking outcome has been the disgusting amount of victim shaming happening online.

People saying things like, ‘Why wasn’t she walking with a man? She should have got an Uber?’

At one point, the hashtag #notallmen was actually trending above her name – as men rushed to defend themselves and insist they’d never hurt a woman, almost making it all about them.

They’re completely missing the point.

It’s not up to women to stay indoors, or to protect themselves and not walk alone. It should be up to men not to attack us.

While parents are teaching their daughters to protect themselves, they should be teaching their sons not to make women feel anxious or afraid.

I actually had a man tell me to stay at home when I tweeted about Sarah, saying he was stronger than me so he could go out on the streets and I shouldn’t.

I also had a male friend message me, asking me to explain to him why women were upset with police telling them to stay at home. I had to explain to him that it was because they were essentially taking our freedoms away, but not taking any of men’s away.

I don’t think a lot of men had realised the full extent of how many precautions we take every day.

As women, it should be our right to be able to walk alone, enjoy some time on our own and not be worried. Men have that right, why shouldn’t we?

It’s your me time, you can listen to your podcast, listen to music, and lose yourself a bit. You shouldn’t have to have your guard up.

But of course, you do.

It’s become second nature now for me to only ever have one headphone in when walking on my own, and I hide my headphones in my clothes so nobody can see I’ve got them on.

When we say goodbye to our friends, the line ‘text me when you’re home safe’ comes as easily as ‘bye’.

I had Find My Friends on my phone so I could track where my best friend was, I’ll always share my Uber journey with someone, I hold my umbrella in my hand as some added security. It’s all just habit.

Yet still, it’s not always enough. Too many of us still feel that overwhelming fear when we’re walking alone.

Last year, I was walking down Clapham Park Road on my way home in the middle of the afternoon and there was a man running behind me.

I wasn’t paying much attention, I think I was listening to a podcast, and as he overtook me he touched my leg – really high up.

I remember his hand felt really wet. It happened so fast, I had no warning or time to react.

I just froze, looked around and no one had seen. When I got home I reported it to the police, but they never found anything.

I was really shaken and worried about going out for a while after that. I even thought, ‘should I be wearing tights?’ but it was a sunny day, why should I have to?

Just months later, I was walking home past Brockwell Park. It was dark and I just felt so on edge, I found myself constantly scanning and checking around me, with this irrational fear that someone was going to come out of the park at me. I even turned off my music.

Women take these steps as second nature.

I’ll always remember years ago, when I was in Leicester Square, a man grabbed my crotch as I was walking.

I actually went round the corner afterwards and put some tights on, feeling like I needed to cover up.

The shocking scene, from the new Netflix series The Lost Pirate Kingdom, shows the brutality of life on the high seas in the golden age of piracy.

The eight part documentary series with dramatic reenactments, reveals how the 18th century privateers - seamen paid by the state to raid enemy ships in the war between England and Spain - became lawless pirates in peacetime.

Ruthless killers including Blackbeard, Edward Low and the notorious Charles Vane used intimidation, torture and brutality to steal gold, silver and ships.

They even set up their own kingdom in Nassau, in the Bahamas, to escape the law.

Jessica Cale, author of Dirty, Sexy History, tells the show: “This is a culture of horrendous violence. Men could be beaten, sometimes to death, for minor indiscretions.”

The real pirates of the Caribbean were far more bloodthirsty than Jack Sparrow in the movies.

From crew members routinely lashed with whips, beaten and kicked to hostages being disembowelled alive, we look at the grisly life and crimes of real pirates.

Sadist who revelled in gruesome murders

Thought to have grown up in the East End of London, Charles Vane was known for his sadistic streak towards crew and enemy alike.

In one notorious incident, in 1718, Vane and his crew looted the Bermuda sloop Diamond and viciously beat the captain and crew.

Vane then singled out one crew member, Nathaniel Catling, to be hung.

Thinking he was dead, they pulled him from the noose but he revived ""whereupon one of the pirates hacked him across the collarbone with his cutlass and would have continued until he had murdered him had not one of the other pirates persuaded him it 'was too great a cruelty.'""

His brutality towards his crew, who he also cheated of the spoils of their raids, meant frequent mutinies and eventually led to his downfall.

After being shipwrecked on an inhabited island in the Bay of Honduras, Vane was rescued by a ship - only for a former member of his own crew to recognise him and hand him over the authorities.

Vane was hanged and gibbeted - dipped in tar and hung in a steel cage as a warning to others.

Teen wife forced to sleep with crew

A close friend and colleague of Vane, Edward Thatch - better known as Blackbeard - revelled in his reputation for brutality.

A former privateer, who learned his trade aboard the pirate ships of Nassau founder Benjamin Hornigold, Thatch branched out on his own by commandeering a huge French vessel and equipping her with 40 guns. He named her 'Queen Anne's Revenge'.

Blackbeard instilled fear in crews and captives alike and, while many think his violent reputation was exaggerated, he lived up to the legend with random acts of violence.

According to contemporary writer Daniel Defoe, he once shot his second-in-command, Israel Hands in the knee under the table during a game of cards, leaving with a limp for life.

16 Captain Blackbeard was feared by crew and enemies

When asked why, he answered that, “if he did not now and then kill one of them, they would forget who he was.""

After obtaining a pardon from the governor of North Carolina, Blackbeard married 16-year-old Mary Ormond, the daughter of a local landowner, in 1718.

Defoe wrote: “After he had lain all night, it was his custom to invite five or six of his brutal companions to come ashore, and he would force her to prostitute herself to them all, one after another, before his face.""

Blackbeard was decapitated by naval officer Robert Maynard during the capture of his ship, in 1718.

Captain's lips cut off and boiled

Brought up in a family of criminals, London-born Edward Low moved to Boston and married Eliza Marble, in 1714.

When Eliza died in childbirth, Low turned to piracy and became known for his brutality, capturing over 100 ships gleefully torturing their crew.

Victims were cut, whipped, burned and starved to death in an effort to glean information about sunken treasures and ship schedules.

One of his favourite torture techniques involved tying a victim's hands with rope between their fingers and setting it alight, burning their flesh down to the bones.

A letter describing one raid on a Portuguese ship claimed Low: ""Cut off the said Master's lips and broiled them before his face, and afterwards murdered the whole crew, being thirty-two persons.""

Low was thought to have been caught and hanged by the French.

Innards nailed to post in deadly 'dance'

Known as ‘the exterminator’ for his love of slaughtering the enemy, French buccaneer Daniel Montbars came from a wealthy family but his hatred of the Spanish led him to a life on the high seas.

After one raid on a Spanish galleon, one witness said he slaughtered numerous crew members, adding: “His only pleasure seemed to be to contemplate, not the treasures of the vessel, but the number of dead and dying Spaniards.""

One particularly gruesome method of murder was cutting open the stomach of his victim, extracting one end of his intestines and nailing it to a post.

She married sailor, James Bonny, and moved to Nassau, quickly abandoning her husband and turning to piracy when she met infamous buccaneer Calico Jack.

The pair had a child together before taking to the seas - where Anne earned a reputation of being fierce and brave.

Anne was captured after fighting Navy soldiers on deck, while her husband and crew were drunk below, and escaped hanging because she was pregnant.

Her last words to her husband, before he was executed were: ""Had you fought like a man, you need not have been hang'd like a dog.""

The ten-part series is set in 1953 and follows an African American family, the Emorys, as they move to an all-white neighbourhood and face terror at the hands of racists.

8 Viewers have dubbed the horror ""disturbing"" Credit: YouTube/Amazon Prime Video

While the series has gained a four star rating on Amazon, it's had viewers divided from the outset due to its gruesome nature.

Audiences have called out the scenes of racist violence as ""traumatic and disturbing"", with others admitting they had to ""turn it off"" due to the tension.

Some have warned of scenes including ""violence, infanticide, rape, hate crime and mutilation"" that made for horrific and uncomfortable viewing.

""This show is terrifying, brutal, disturbing and heartbreaking,"" one man began. ""It got so bad in one episode that I couldn't even sleep.""

""Them is probably one of the most distressing series I've ever seen,"" another agreed. ""I wasn’t ready for how disturbing it was going to get.""

""It’s just a series of black people being tortured and I can’t even stomach to finish the rest,"" a third wrote. ""I have to take breaks to mentally and emotionally prepare myself to watch this.""

While a fourth chimed in: ""Every episode is more traumatic than the previous. It’s making me mad and sad at the same time.""

Even horror writer Stephen King admitted he had been left ""scared"" by the series, writing to Twitter: ""The first episode scared the hell out of me, and I'm hard to scare.""

Others praised the series as ""necessary"" and ""important"" as it addresses a history of ""horrendous"" racist abuse.

""Them was the absolute most horrendous, disgusting, disturbing, horrifying but necessary and beautiful piece of cinematic work,"" one woman wrote.

""Proceed with caution, but know that every frame has important and a resounding message.""

Another agreed: ""Outstandingly good and disturbing in equal measure. Amazing performances. Amazing storytelling. Amazing music.""

8 One scene sees a white woman beat a baby to death Credit: YouTube/Amazon Prime Video

It comes as the new show has been slammed as ""trauma porn"" and accused of appealing to ""hate crime fantasies"", with some even saying they ""though a white person wrote it"".

The show was created by Lena Waithe along with screenwriter Little Marvin, and shows the family experiencing both supernatural horror and racism at the hands of their new neighbors.

Little Marvin has defended the depictions of violence, saying it shows ""authenticity"" about what black people experienced during in a segregated America.

But it still proves for difficult viewing, with one particular scene sparking controversy, as protagonist Lucky Emory (Deborah Ayorinde) and her baby son are attacked by a mob.

The deeply upsetting moment sees a white woman steal Lucky's baby Chester and throw him to the floor while the helpless mother is assaulted.

""I can normally deal with horror and death but children, that's just a weak spot for me, the tears won't stop rolling,"" one viewers said of the scene.

""I was trying to cover my ears and eyes at the same time through that,"" a second agreed. ""I need to pour a drink before the next episode.""

Numerous critics have slated the show's use of violence, with an editorial in the LA Times noting: ""[It] raises questions about whether the depiction of white supremacist savagery goes too far.""

And a review by iNews has the writer saying she had to walk away from the television, saying the story is ""trauma porn in a horror guise"".

""The racial symbolism feels far too crude, and a smattering of N-words and blackface are used as cheap shock value rather than to make genuine social commentary,"" noted another editorial in The Independent.

Little Marvin defended his work and said the aim was not to be ""provocative or hot button"".

He told LA Times: ""Yes, there is a concern, but at the end of the day, I as an artist have to sit with myself and grapple with the authenticity of the show.

8 Some critics have been left terrified by the series Credit: YouTube/Amazon Prime Video

""If I can sleep at night knowing this entire enterprise has an authenticity and integrity to it, then I'm good.""

He said he wanted to ask two questions, ""what terrified us the most and what felt most true. Typically, those two things were the same"".

And he says the violent show as a place in the ""scary place"" that is 2021.

He said: ""We're incredibly fractured and split down the middle. There are people who want to take the country back to a time they consider great, and there are folks who are fighting for progress.""

The US continues to face a reckoning over racism, laid bare with a string of protests and riots last summer over the killing of George Floyd and other black people by police officers.

White supremacy and far right extremism also is on the rise, with President Joe Biden calling for funding to probe the beliefs within government agencies.

Little Marvin said recent violence against black people inspired Them.

He said: ""My inspiration was waking up every day and seeing cellphone videos of black people being terrorized in some ways, either by threats from police, surveillance or something else.""

Abdifatah Abdirahman Warsame and Abdishakur Mohamed Dige were both shot in the main square of Bossasso, on Somalia's north coast, for the brutal killing of Aisha Ilyes Aden.

Aisha Ilyes Aden was abducted at a market in northern Puntland’s Galkayo town in February last year.

Her body was found the next morning near her home and she had been gang-raped, her genitals mutilated before being strangled to death.

Adeer Ilyas, the victim’s father witnessed the execution and said he was happy that justice had been served.

The brutal nature of the killing triggered public outrage and demonstrations, as well as an online protest using the hashtag JusticeForAisha.

Three men were convicted and sentenced to death in May last year and the decision was upheld by an appeal court in June.

OUTRAGE AT MURDER

“This is a clear indication that justice is served in Puntland,” said Puntland’s Justice Minister Awil Sheikh Hamid told a news conference.

“It is an alert for those who try to carry out crimes against women and girls.”

The execution of a third man, Abdirahman Warsame’s brother Abdisalam, was delayed for 10 days at the request of Aisha’s father, Adan Ilyas.

Somalia’s semi-autonomous Puntland region passed the country’s first law criminalising offences such as sexual harassment and rape in 2016.

Rape victims in the east African nation are stigmatised and forced to marry assailants.

Convictions under the law are rare, as police are either unaware of the law or do not see violence against women as a serious crime, say women’s rights campaigners.

The jury was shown CCTV of Polish butcher Pawel Relowicz, 26, pleasuring himself after the 21-year-old student was murdered.

Libby was allegedly driven to a remote playing field by the butcher, where she was raped, murdered then dumped in a river.

The Polish-born dad-of-two, from Hull, East Yorkshire, denies murdering and raping philosophy student Libby, who went missing following a night out in February 2019.

She was discovered six weeks later on March 20 in the Humber estuary by a fishing boat – a gold necklace bearing the letter ‘L’ still hanging around her neck.

Relowicz claims to have had consensual sex with Libby before driving home.

CAUGHT ON CCTV

But today Prosecutor Richard Wright QC revealed that just hours after Relowicz came into contact with Libby, he was back out on the street looking for women to pleasure himself in front of.

He left his house again and drove back to the playing fields where he is accused of raping Libby.

Relowicz claims he returned to the playing fields to see if the student was ok, but he was later captured on CCTV performing a solo sex act in the street.

The court heard that he left a used condom on the path after he had finished.

Relowicz denied that it was “what he did to Libby” that made him so aroused.

Mr Wright told the court that after he had finished his sex act in the street, Relowicz continued to drive around to look for women.

At around 3.10am, he is seen again on CCTV on foot on the corner of the street near his house.

Relowicz claimed that he ""needed some fresh air"" and felt ""emotionally broken"" for cheating on his wife. He said he did not like lying to his wife.

CONDOM 'CALLING CARDS'

Yesterday Relowicz was described as a ""disgusting"" Peeping Tom who ""violated intimate moments"" by his own lawyer in court.

The jury were told Relowicz had pleaded guilty to nine sexually motivated offences, committed in the months before Libby Squire's death including voyeurism, outraging public decency and burglary.

His last offence occurred just days before Libby went missing in 2019.

The butcher had exposed himself to women and performed sex acts on himself in the street in the year leading up to her death, the court heard.

Mr Wright told the court he left ""calling cards"" such as used condoms and that he got a ""kick out of"" scaring women.

The Supreme Court issued its ruling yesterday despite a lengthy battle for justice by the victim and her family.

4 Demonstrators have vented their anger at the sexual abuse of Julie when she was a schoolgirl

The ruling comes despite a decision made on Monday by politicians to back new laws setting an age of consent at 15, paving the way to ensure that adults who have sex with children younger than 15 are prosecuted for rape.

Until the law comes into force, there is currently no age of consent in France, meaning there needs to be proof sex with an under-18 was non-consensual in order to obtain a rape conviction.

The girl – now aged 26 and known as Julie – was let down by authorities and the legal system, says her mum Corinne Leriche after years of abuse by the firefighters who treated her as a “sexual object”.

Her family have expressed their anger at the “sexist, erroneous” judgement, which they say is based on “archaic ideology”.

It validates a false vision of the balance of power between an adult and minor Corinne Leriche

“[The judgement] validates a false vision of the balance of power between an adult and a minor,” said the Leriche family.

“It embraces the sexist, erroneous and violent representations of sexuality and, at the same time that all of society is rising up against this archaic ideology today.

“This judgment is undoubtedly at odds with reality and with France's international obligations.”

Julie says 20 firefighters had sex with her when she was aged between 13 and 15 in her house, in the fire station and in a hospital toilet.

The abuse happened after the emergency services were called to help when Julie was unwell at home, around 130 times over the two-year period.

She eventually told her mum, who reported it to cops and although no action was taken against 17 of the firefighters, three of them were charged with sexual abuse.

Her mum told BFMTV the firefighters called her daughter the “coch”, or “slut” and had her number posted in their barracks in Paris.

In an earlier ruling, magistrates refused to prosecute the firefighters for rape after deciding Julie had not been forced to have sex with them and was “provocative and flirtatious”.

Julie contested the decision before the Supreme Court, arguing her age, health problems and medication she was taking that made her lethargic meant she could not be considered to have consented to sex.

Judges dismissed her case, ruling that “the victim had the necessary discernment” and there was no proof she had been obliged to have sex.

The firefighters will now be tried for sexual abuse, which carries a maximum sentence of seven years in jail, rather than rape, which has a maximum sentence of 20 years.

What is the age of consent in France? In France, there is no official age of consent. However, adults who sleep with children under the age of 15 can be convicted - yet lawyers have to prove the sex was non-consensual to obtain a conviction of rape. If the underage victim cannot prove they were forced or coerced into sex, then the accused may only be charged with sexual violation which carries a maximum jail term of just seven years. In 2018, protests over a case of a man in his late-20s having sex with an 11-year-old led to a change in the consent laws being proposed in France. However, the law was not passed after a report by the government said such a change would lead to ""an assumption of guilt.""

Shockwaves have spread across France, as supporters of the #JusticePourJulie campaign shared their outrage at the court’s judgement.

One tweeted: “Still in shock, still outraged by the decision of the court.""

Another highlighted that firefighters’ duty is to “protect” citizens.

“Knowing how to say no to sexual relations with a minor is the basis,” they wrote.

“France is losing its ethics. In order to preserve children there must be sanctions.”

A third supporter raged: “What does 'human rights' mean for #Julie? The right to be raped from 13 to 15 years by 20 adults who will be protected by their accomplices of justice?

“Julie is a victim, she was vulnerable, justice does not understand it, we are in 2021! #JusticeForJulie.”

Mme Leriche, who says that her daughter is now disabled after throwing herself out of a window and breaking three vertebrae, described the ruling as a “permit to rape”.

She added the court had “missed an opportunity” to clampdown on rapists and now plans to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights.

You're Not Alone EVERY 90 minutes in the UK a life is lost to suicide. It doesn't discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society - from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers. It's the biggest killer of people under the age of 35, more deadly than cancer and car crashes. And men are three times more likely to take their own life than women. Yet it's rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now. That is why The Sun launched the You're Not Alone campaign. The aim is that by sharing practical advice, raising awareness and breaking down the barriers people face when talking about their mental health, we can all do our bit to help save lives.

The author, British scientist Dr George Murray Levick, observed the perverted birds engaging in gang rapes and necrophilia during an expedition to the Antarctic.

He wrote the manuscript following months of research while accompanying doomed explorer Robert Scott on his famous 1910-1913 expedition to the South Pole.

Among other sexual behaviours of ""astonishing depravity"", Dr Levick noted that ""promiscuity"" and ""infidelity"" were rife among the colony of Adélie penguins he studied.

But that was far from the worst of it: Rape, gang rape and the sexual abuse of chicks by adults were all recorded by the Nottingham-born scientist.

Necrophilia was also commonplace, with offenders often mating with birds who had died the previous year.

Dr Levick's now-infamous notes on the Ridley Beach colony of Adélie penguins, known to be the largest colony in the world even today, will be researched in detail by experts at the Natural History Museum.

They hope to use the zoologist's observations, which he refrained from publishing in a book he wrote about the expedition, to better understand the threatened colony, which today numbers 335,000 penguins.

""The area Levick studied around Ridley Beach, Cape Adare will probably be abandoned in the near future due to the rising sea level in this region,” the museum's Douglas Russell said.

""The birds will likely retreat to higher elevations at Cape Adare and the Scott Coast will be reoccupied.""

Dr Levick's unpublished notes on the birds were uncovered by Douglas in 2012 following a century-long cover up.

Upon his return to Britain, Dr Levick was urged by his fellow zoologists not to publish his notes as they were deemed too graphic for the general public.

“The research we undertook in 2012 gave the story of the rediscovery of a paper he tried unsuccessfully to publish on the sexual behaviours he witnessed but this is only a tiny fraction of the notebooks,” Douglas said.

“They are an incredible, largely unexplored first-hand account of the natural history of Cape Adare, Antarctica, from the heroic age of Polar Exploration – they are also the first full account of the world’s largest Adélie penguin colony.”

Same-sex pairing among animals Gay penguins of either sex are nothing new, and are found both in the wild and in captivity. For example, most of the penguins housed at Dingle Oceanworld Aquarium in Ireland are gay. Same-sex penguins from London Zoo were at this year's Pride event in the capital. Research shows that about 1,500 animal species are known to practice same-sex coupling, from insects to mammals. They include monkeys, black swans, lizards, vultures, elephants, bats, lions, seep and dolphins.

Dr Levick blamed the penguins' horrifying behaviour on ""hooligan males"".

He was so shocked that he wrote down his observations in Greek so only educated gentlemen could understand it.

As well as rape and other depravities, some penguins even engaged in ""prostitution"", with males using stones to pimp out females.

It may sound a bit far-fetched, but the behaviour was confirmed by scientists in a separate study of Adélie penguins in 1998.

Some prostituted penguins have even been shown to trick males into thinking they would have sex by performing an elaborate courtship ritual, then run away with their stones.

These were 21 rapes, five counts of false imprisonment, two counts of assault by penetration and two of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

The musician, who was part of the grime collective Boy Better Know, derived sexual pleasure from torturing the women by water-boarding, interrogating, assaulting and raping them.

He claimed the acts were part of consensual role play, or a game he played called ""Catch me, Rape me"", and said he told women he would ""terrorise"" them.

Police began investigating Anokye, who is from London but had a harbourside apartment in Bristol, in 2017 after a woman complained she had been raped by him.

""CATCH ME, RAPE ME""

After his arrest, officers discovered harrowing footage filmed by Anokye on his mobile phone that revealed he had abused multiple women.

Judge William Hart imposed an extended sentence, meaning Anokye will serve 24 years in prison and five on licence, and ordered he must sign the sex offenders register for life.

The judge told Anokye, who appeared by video link from HMP Long Lartin, he had ""no sexual boundaries or empathy for those concerned"".

He said Anokye had ""become addicted"" to the ""perverted pleasure"" he took from abusing the women in the case.

The judge added: ""You have a background that includes gang associations and criminal violence.

""I am entirely satisfied that your career as an artist was flourishing at the time of this offending and would have gone to greater heights.

""The popular acclaim that greeted performances of your best-known track Feed Em To The Lions was evident in the various videos that the jury saw of your performances.

You have a background that includes gang associations and criminal violence."" Judge William Hart

""You were part of a well-known collective - Boy Better Know. The fellow artists from that collective have achieved great success.""

The judge said none of those fellow artists were aware of Anokye's behaviour, or ""dark side"".

He added: ""But none of those artists, dedicated to their craft, knew of your dark side and they are in no way tainted by your misdeeds which were carried out in a wholly private and hidden way.

""Your convictions have deprived you of that career but the fault is yours alone.""

During the trial, the graphic video clips filmed by Anokye were played to the jury.

They showed Anokye interrogating the women about previous sexual partners, slapping them, insulting them and raping them.

One clip showed a woman crying and saying ""I hate you"", with the musician laughing and making a thumbs-up sign to the camera.

GRAPHIC VIDEOS

Anokye, who was signed to Island Records and had collaborated with Stormzy, JME and Wiley, was described as a ""violent, controlling narcissist and a bully"" by prosecutors during the case.

The trial heard he forced one woman to lie in a bath of freezing cold water and held a shotgun to the head of another woman.

His abuse included holding a cloth covered in bleach to women's faces, with one woman telling jurors he had forced a mobile phone down her throat.

Giving evidence, Anokye told the court he had dacryphilia - sexual arousal from tears.

Following Anokye's arrest, police examined videos and images on three mobile phones, an external hard drive and a laptop found at his apartment in Bristol.

They contacted further women and three came forward with complaints of abuse at his hands.

A fifth woman also gave evidence against Anokye during the trial, but jurors heard he could not be charged with alleged offences against her as they took place abroad.

Sally O'Neill QC, representing Anokye, said he is willing to undergo treatment programmes for his behaviour.

It appeared to be confirmed by bodycam video that shows officers opening fire within seconds of arriving to a street scuffle in Ohio.

🔵 Read our Ma'Khia Bryant shooting live blog for the latest updates

Ma'Khia Bryant, 16, was fatally shot by police in Columbus, Ohio

18 Graphic bodycam video shows cops shooting her within seconds of arriving

In the footage an officer can be heard shouting ""Get down, get down!"" before four rapid gunshots.

No order for anyone to drop a weapon is heard as a three young women are seen brawling on the street.

Just before she is shot, Ma'Khia can be seen apparently swinging a knife at another girl who is sprawled on the hood of a car.

The graphic video then shows Ma'Khia slumped against the car fatally wounded in Columbus.

Her death emerged hours after the verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial, which was hailed as a reckoning for police violence against black Americans.

Last night a neighbor identified as Tay Jones said on Facebook she had witnessed the shooting and posted a video purportedly from the scene.

She said the teen had the knife “because somebody tried to jump her.”

The white police officer who shot her never told her to put down the knife, according to Jones.

It comes as:

Ma'khia was shot around 25 minutes before the long-awaited verdict in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis cop who killed George Floyd.

News of her death tempered celebrations across the country as Joe Biden called the Floyd family and told them: ""Thank God you have justice.""

Columbus police said they were called at 4.32pm by a person who said someone was trying to stab them.

Officers arrived 12 minutes later and found Ma'khia engaged in a scuffle with two other young women.

After shooting her, more than half a minute passed before an officer knelt down to check on her and give first aid, the bodycam footage shows.

She was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead soon after.

Her aunt Hazel Bryant said it was Ma'khia who called cops because she was being abused by someone at the foster home where she lived.

She told The Columbus Dispatch her niece got into a fight with the other girl, and dropped the knife before she was shot.

""She didn’t deserve to die like a dog in the street,"" Hazel told reporters.

She added: ""Ma'Khia had a motherly nature about her. She promoted peace.

""That's something that I want to always be remembered.""

News of the shootings of a black teenager first spread on social media.

A video shared online showed a girl on the ground as white police officers stood over her.

With unprecedented speed, police released the bodycam video within hours of the shooting.

Can that really be true, when the experience is as devastating, as terrifying, as tragic, as this pandemic?

5 Esther Rantzen's new documentary sees her meet people who have suffered the loss of loved ones Credit: ViacomCBS / Photographer Dave King

I believe it is, and that there are valuable lessons to learn from the grief this illness has created.

Covid has caused more than 100,000 deaths in the UK. It’s such a huge statistic we can’t really take it in. But it’s not just a number.

It means that a million, maybe even more, of those left behind will never be the same again, having lost someone in devastating circumstances, unable to hold them, comfort them, even say a last, loving goodbye to them.

I know about loss, of course. Nearly all of my generation have lost someone we are close to or someone we love.

In September 2000 I sat on my husband’s death bed, knowing I could do nothing to save him.

But we did hold each other, we did say goodbye, he did tell me he loved me, and heard me say I loved him back.

I didn’t feel lucky at the time, but now I realise I was. In the strange, machine- littered hospital ICUs where the staff are dressed like spacemen and hands are gloved, faces obscured, death happens very differently.

In making my new documentary about grief, I interviewed Mandy, who lives in Essex, and whose husband Larry died from Covid last April. For 43 years they’d had a deeply loving marriage.

In their sixties, they both caught the virus last year, and he was taken to hospital two hours before she was.

SHAKEN TO THE CORE

Mandy told me: “My last words to him were, ‘I’ve got you an ambulance, darling. My darling, let me put a jumper over you. I’m sorry I can’t save your life because I’m so very ill.’

“I said, ‘I love you, darling, I’ve put clean pants in.’ I put my hand on his shoulder and I never saw him again.”

They were nursed one floor apart from each other in Basildon Hospital, both struggling under the impact of this terrible illness.

Mandy told me: “I was in a ward for Covid. Everybody had PPE on.

“The nurse came up, took my hand with her gloves, both hands, and she just sat and it meant ‘he’s gone’.”

Mandy is a vibrant, energetic woman, but the shock has thrown her off balance and shaken her to the core.

She said: “We had three children, a wonderful life. He was my rock and I’m lost.”

Covid restrictions meant that she couldn’t have the funeral she would have wanted.

5 Esther lost her husband Desmond in 2000 Credit: PA:Press Association

The undertaker was dealing with 21 bereaved families that day, and Larry’s funeral had to be outside, with only six people present.

That has left Mandy struggling with disbelief a year later. She told me: “I didn’t believe he was in the coffin — I never saw his body so it didn’t feel real.”

Her children are supporting her emotionally, but as I know from my own three when their father died, the children are dealing with their own loss.

Some friends have been very helpful, but others are oddly insensitive, expecting her to move on now almost a year has gone by.

The truth is that we all grieve our own way. There should be no judgments.

Bereavement has always been with us, long before the pandemic created headlines out of numbers.

Making our programme I have listened to many brave people who have lost loved ones from many other causes, and are still living with grief. They have dealt with it in different ways.

Some convert their pain and use it to create a lasting memorial to their loved one.

Lucy, whose toddler Jack drowned, is campaigning to change the law and spread awareness to support others suffering loss.

Amber, a young woman whose mother died very suddenly, has created an online group to support the young, who are often left out when we think of supporting the ones left behind.

Joy’s father was in such pain in his final illness that he took his own life, with the result that her mother was accused of murder. She believes we must change the laws around assisted dying.

Durone has found that religion has supported him since his brother was murdered. And Gary, an artist who has lost his lovely wife Joy, uses his art to express his feelings.

Each one of them has thoughts that helped me, and I’m sure viewers will find them empowering and uplifting.

HEROIC STRENGTH

I learnt some practical ideas, too. The uniqueness of Mandy’s pain, exacerbated by Covid restrictions, makes me feel that the Department of Health should commission a helpline to support Covid bereaved families and their carers.

And let’s create a new Bank Holiday, Covid Remembrance Day, when all this is over. Let’s take a day off work so that we all can dedicate the time to remembering and giving thanks.

I know it seems odd to give thanks when we have lost so many. But I have learned from my own experience, and from talking to people who have also lost loved ones, that alongside the loss is a thankfulness that we have had that person in our life.

We could devote our Covid Remembrance Day also to giving thanks for the heroic strength of everyone we depended upon to survive — in our hospitals, in our cemeteries, in our supermarkets and pharmacies, in the laboratories, in government departments, whether they were dedicated staff or, like Captain Sir Tom Moore, they were inspired volunteers.

And, of course, we need to remember the work of thousands of carers, nurses, doctors, scientists, psychologists, many struggling with their own pain, their own challenges, all sharing an overwhelming desire to save lives and limit the devastation caused by this pandemic.

The dedicated number, run by the NSPCC, will go live tomorrow and provide advice to children and adults, the Department for Education said.

Anyone who calls the helpline will be offered guidance on how to report a crime and can refer allegations to the police if they wish.

Support will also be available to parents and professionals.

Meanwhile, the government has announced an immediate review into sexual abuse in schools following thousands of allegations from students.

Ofsted will look at safeguarding policies in state and independent schools as well as the “extent and the severity of the issue” - and ensure there are systems in place for pupils to report their concerns.

It will also ensure schools have enough guidance when dealing with sexual harassment and violence allegations, and whether current school inspection systems are strong enough to address any concerns.

The Department for Education said Ofsted will work with social care, police, victim support groups, school and college leaders, as well as the Independent Schools Council.

The review is review expected to conclude by the end of May.

'HUGE SOCIETAL PROBLEM'

It comes after more than 10,000 reports were posted on the Everyone's Invited website, where students can anonymously share their experiences of misogyny, harassment, abuse and assault.

Education committee chief and Tory MP Robert Halfon yesterday said the website made for “pretty grim reading” and warned there was a “Lord of the Flies culture” in some British schools.

And Chief Constable Simon Bailey has also claimed that elite British schools have covered up allegations of sex abuse to protect their reputations.

He told the Daily Telegraph the crisis engulfing public schools could be the ""next major scandal"" for the country and a ""huge societal problem"".

Mr Bailey also said he fears a ""culture of misogyny and sexual harassment"" has not been stopped in schools.

Speaking after today’s announcement, education secretary Gavin Williamson said: “Sexual abuse in any form is abhorrent and it is vital that these allegations are dealt with properly.

“While the majority of schools take their safeguarding responsibilities extremely seriously, I am determined to make sure the right resources and processes are in place across the education system to support any victims of abuse to come forward.

“This Government is committed to ensuring victims feel supported to refer the most serious allegations to the police via the helpline, safe in the knowledge that everything possible will be done to bring offenders to justice.

'DEEPLY TROUBLED'

“No child or young person should have to experience abuse. But if something isn’t right, they should speak to someone they trust to raise concerns, whether that’s family, a friend, teacher or social worker, helpline or the police.”

Mr Williamson said the DfE would not hesitate to take action should schools fail to meet strict safeguarding standards.

Ofsted Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman said: “Like everyone else, I have been deeply troubled by accounts of the sexual abuse and harassment young people have suffered at school and in the community.

""So I welcome the Secretary of State’s announcement and the opportunity for Ofsted to lead this review.

“Schools have a crucial role to play in teaching young people about sexual consent and respect for women and girls.

""They must also be places where all children feel safe, and where they are able to report any incidents of abuse or harassment and be confident that what they say will be acted upon.""

Wendy Mair, from Everyone's Invited, said: ""Everyone's Invited is proud to have started a crucial conversation.

""We are encouraged to see that the Government has responded and taken the first initial steps to review rape culture in all schools.

""We await confirmation from Gavin Williamson that Everyone's Invited will be included in carrying out this review and are disappointed that he did not contact us before this announcement.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan called the tactics “unacceptable” while Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey wanted Met chief Dame Cressida Dick to resign.

But the watchdog document approves the policing of the event on March 13.

Critics, though unnamed, were accused of showing “a distinct lack of respect for public servants” facing a sensitive situation.

The report praises frontline officers for remaining “calm and professional” while receiving vile abuse from a hardline minority.

A woman told a female cop she hoped the officer would be raped and murdered, says the report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services.

Protesters first took to the streets on March 21, 2021, and again on March 26, 2021 to demonstrate against the new Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill - with demonstrations then taking place in other cities across the country in later days.

What is the new Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill?

The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill would give forces in England and Wales more power to impose conditions on non-violent protests.

That includes those deemed too noisy or a nuisance, with fines or jail for those convicted.

Police chiefs will be able to impose conditions such as a start and finish time and noise limit on a static protest.

The police already have the power to put such conditions on marches.

A description on the Government website says: ""This measure will broaden the range of circumstances in which the police can impose conditions on protests, including a single person protest, to include where noise causes a significant impact on those in the vicinity or serious disruption to the running of an organisation.

""This measure will close a loophole which some protesters exploit.""

It will allow police to give hefty fines to offenders if the Bill becomes law.

Failure to comply with police directions on how the protest is conducted could land a fine of up to £2,500.

What are the 'Kill the Bill' protests?

""Kill the Bill"" is in response to government plans to give police more power to impose restrictions on protests through the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill.

It has been debated and voted on in Parliament and at the time of the protest on March 21 had moved to the committee stage in the House of Lords.

On the night of Sunday, March 21, a peaceful protest turned violent as masked thugs smashed up a police station and attacked officers during a ""disgusting"" riot in Bristol.

A ""mob of animals"" left cops with broken arms and ribs, set fire to police vans and hurled fireworks during violent clashes.

The crowd shouted “Shame on you” as at least two police vehicles were set on fire, while others were smashed up, daubed with graffiti and had their tyres let down.

Yobs armed with baseball bats also smashed glass panels of Bristol’s Bridewell police station while officers in riot gear, others on horseback and police dogs attempted to disperse the baying crowd.

Protesters wore masks and carried placards that read: “Say no to UK police state”, “Freedom to protest is fundamental to democracy” and “Kill the Bill”.

Mass gatherings are currently banned because of the pandemic.

But thousands turned up despite officers strongly advising against doing so.

Home Secretary Priti Patel took to Twitter to slam the protest, saying: ""Unacceptable scenes in Bristol. Thuggery and disorder by a minority will never be tolerated.

""Our police officers put themselves in harms way to protect us all. My thoughts this evening are with those police officers injured.""

And again on March 26, protests turned violent once again.

Riot cops used shields to push back thousands of booing demonstrators who threw the fireworks along with bottles and eggs at police on the third night of chaos in less than a week.

The latest riot saw 10 people arrested.

One of the detained rioters has since been issued a fixed penalty notice while the other nine remain in custody, cops said.

The protests have been held in Bristol over the past week, protesting against the Government's Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill - with 24 people now arrested in total.

And during Friday's demonstrations protesters could be heard chanting ""ten years for protest, five years for rape"" and ""justice for Sarah"", referring to the recent murder of Sarah Everard in London.

It comes after demonstrations on Sunday and Tuesday had also started peacefully before descending into assaults against police and acts of vandalism.

Since then demonstrations have also taken place in a number of cities,.

People gathered in London, Newcastle, Liverpool and Portsmouth, on April 3, with more cities expected to be flooded with campaigners.

Kill the Bill protesters caused mayhem on the night of April 3 by blocking a motorway while violent clashes with cops saw 28 people arrested.

In Bristol protesters sat in the middle of the M32, while in London demonstrators battled with officers on the streets.

The Sun has revealed that demonstrations, not just by Kill the Bill activists, are a huge drain on police resources, costing an estimated £40million a year.

Former police minister Sir Mike Penning said: “This is not about stopping peaceful demonstrations.

""We’ve always cherished our right to protest. But nobody has the right to abuse police officers and bring the country to its knees.""

A petition against the Bill has also been launched and will be sent to the National Police Chiefs Council.

Entitled ""Protect Your Freedom To Protest"", it has already been signed more than 206,000 times.

It reads: ""The government is planning to make important changes to the law that will restrict the right to protest when lockdown restrictions ease.

""We oppose this new planned legislation and instead demand that the National Police Chiefs Council adopts a new, eleven-point Charter for Freedom of Assembly Rights – or explain why they refuse to do so.""","['Katie Davis', 'Joseph Gamp']","PROTESTS have been held across the UK, demonstrating against the Government's Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill.

Jill, 29, and her husband Derick, 32, have said they ""hope justice is done"" after her brother Josh was arrested on two counts of child pornography.

The couple exclusively told The Sun that they were ""very sad"" following the news that the soon-to-be father of seven had been indicted.

The former Counting On star is currently estranged from her conservative Christian family as her husband and her father, Jim Bob, feud.

Speaking for the first time since Josh’s arrest, Jill said: ""We’re very sad about the whole thing, it’s horrible. It’s all very sad.

Jill and Derick – who left Counting On in 2017 – were spotted earlier on Saturday exercising near their home in Lowell, Arkansas, with their six-year-old son Israel and three-year-old son Samuel.

Derick jogged while Jill rode a bike with Samuel on a seat behind her and Israel pedaled his own.

Josh, 33, was arrested on Thursday and arraigned on Friday over allegations that he downloaded material that depicted the sexual abuse of children under the age of 12, the US Attorney’s Office in the Western District of Arkansas said.

Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar’s oldest son pleaded not guilty to one count of receipt of child pornography and one of possession of child pornography.

He faces 20 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000 if convicted.

Josh is currently being held in the Fayetteville detention center pending a detention hearing on Wednesday.

His attorney Justin Gelfand has said he intends to defend the case ""aggressively and thoroughly.""

19 Kids and Counting was canceled in 2015 after it was claimed that Josh had abused five young girls – four of his sisters and a family friend – while he was a teen.

He was never charged over those allegations.

On Saturday, Derick appeared to like a tweet calling for the cancellation of Counting On.

Counting On – which began in 2016 after 19 Kids and Counting had been terminated and was meant to focus on the older Duggar kids – never featured Josh.

When asked by The Sun about the tweet, Derick said he was not backing the call to can the show but wanted to see more honesty about it.

He told The Sun: ""People assume that Counting On is a different show from 19 Kids and Counting but it’s not, it’s the same show.

""I’m just frustrated that it’s deceptive to the public to say ‘we’re going to change this or change that’ and it’s the exact same.""

Derick also said that he and his wife are planning on writing a book about their experiences, adding: ""I’m in law school right now so my time is limited but I’ve said for a long time that we are planning on writing a book.

""We’re making notes as we think of things and we want to write something that is tasteful but honest.""

Derick and Jill speaking out comes a few days after Josh was charged with two counts of child pornography on Friday.

According to the indictment, Josh “knowingly received child pornography” between or about May 14, 2019 and on or about May 16, 2019.

For the second count, Josh “knowingly possessed material that contained images of child pornography,” including “images of minors under the age of 12.”

Josh has been ordered to forfeit all visual images and property, including video equipment, related to the case.

The Sun previously broke Josh was arrested for the federal charges in Washington County at 1.15 pm on Thursday afternoon.

An insider claimed Josh ""turned himself in"" without incident.

The head-turning revelation is related to the 2019 Homeland Security raid on Josh's now-shuttered used car dealership in Springdale, Arkansas, another source told The Sun.

In November 2019, Homeland Security conducted an “ongoing federal investigation” at the lot, but no charges were filed against Josh - until now.

A source exclusively told The Sun of the Duggar family: ""The family has known that this has been coming for weeks, and Josh has been preparing himself.

""They are praying together for Josh and Anna, who is standing by her husband as she always has.

""Family members are extremely concerned by what is happening and they just want to find out the truth.

""They know that this will put them in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons, and are stunned they are having to go through this again.""

The insider added: ""The family will be speaking out shortly and hope this in many ways will bring them closer together and even closer to God.""

The arrest comes six years after In Touch Weekly uncovered a 33-page Arkansas police report claiming Jim Bob confessed to local authorities that his eldest son fondled the breasts and genitals of young girls while they were asleep in the Duggar family home back in 2002.

Following the allegations against him, Josh addressed the claim: ""Twelve years ago, as a young teenager, I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret.

""I hurt others, including my family and close friends.""

More allegations followed for Josh, as another report just three months later claimed the former TLC star was using adultery dating service Ashley Madison.

He said: ""I have been the biggest hypocrite ever. While espousing faith and family values, I have secretly over the last several years been viewing pornography on the Internet and this has become a secret addiction and I became unfaithful to my wife.""

Soon after, porn star Danica Dillon, whose real name is Ashley Johnston, claimed he assaulted her during a sexual encounter.

A major security operation was launched after the explosive was discovered at the young mum's home in Northern Ireland.

Police Service Northern Ireland have confirmed the device was ""viable"" but was defused by the Armed Forces.

PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Mark McEwan said the bomb was designed to ""cause a fireball"" that would have engulfed the cop and anyone else in the car or nearby.

He added: ""What is really distressing here is that the terrorists placed the bomb at the rear of the car, directly at the point where the victim's three-year-old daughter sits.

""This demonstrates the complete and utter disregard for the life of a mother and her toddler. This simply beggars belief.""

Thankfully officers were able to close off the rural road while the bomb was dealt with and there were no injuries.

5 Forensic officers on the scene today

ACC McEwan said it is a ""strong line of inquiry"" the New IRA are behind the attempted murder but investigations are ongoing.

The group has been responsible for a number of attacks in recent years - including the fatal shooting of journalist Lyra McKee in Londonderry in 2019.

The attack on the officer has been slammed by politicians in Northern Ireland, who have also blamed dissident republicans.

First Minister Arlene Foster said: I stand, as does my entire party, with the brave woman targeted by republicans and utterly condemn those who have sought to harm her and her family

""I do give thanks that she has survived this dreadful murder attempt and when I spoke to this lady earlier, I gave her my prayerful support and indeed solidarity at this difficult time.

""To the republicans who sought to murder this young mother, your campaign is futile, you will never succeed and whilst there may always be different political views in Northern Ireland, we will keep moving forward and we will not be dragged back by bombers or those who would seek to use the gun to get their own political way.""

The IRA and the New IRA The New IRA is an illegal dissident Irish republican paramilitary group which wants a united Ireland. The Real IRA formed in 1997 after a split in the Provisional IRA after some members were unhappy with the IRA’s ceasefire that year and the ensuing Good Friday Agreement which was signed in 1998. The New IRA is believed to have been formed between 2011 and 2012 following the merger of a number of smaller groups, including the Real IRA - the group behind the 1998 Omagh bomb. The terrorist group believes it is the successor to the original Irish Republican Army. Since its formation it has waged a violent campaign against the security forces in Northern Ireland and is thought to be responsible for a number of bombings and shooting. The New IRA is the biggest of the dissident republican groups operating in Northern Ireland. It has been linked with four murders including the shooting of journalist Lyra McKee in Londonderry in 2019. The other murders include Pc Ronan Kerr, who was killed by an under-car bomb in Omagh in 2011. The group is also linked to the deaths of prison officers David Black, who was shot as he drove to work at Maghaberry Prison in 2012, and Adrian Ismay, who died in 2016 after a bomb exploded under his van outside his home in east Belfast. It is strongest in Derry, north and west Belfast, Strabane in Co Derry, Lurgan in Co Armagh, and pockets of Tyrone.

SDLP MLA Cara Hunter said: ""No one should have to live in fear of going to work.

""Our officers protect our communities every day and keep them safe. My thoughts are with the officer and their families.""

Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis blasted: ""The attempted murder of this police officer is absolutely abhorrent. I completely condemn the actions of those involved.

""Those who try to attack public servants have nothing to offer the communities they claim to represent. I want to convey my support for the officer concerned.""

While Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly said: ""The discovery of a device under the car of a young female police officer near Dungiven is disgraceful and I condemn it utterly.

""Thankfully she wasn't hurt but we could have been facing a very different scenario.""

The drama comes amid weeks of unrest in Northern Ireland as PSNI officers continue to come under attack.

Cops have been pelted with stones, bricks and petrol bombs while trying to calm tensions on the streets.

Violence has flared over the Northern Ireland protocol with riots on both sides of gates separating loyalist areas and nationalist areas.

The schoolgirl was terrified after seeing rumours of a ""disgusting"" video that claimed to show men encouraging others to sexually assault women on April 24.

4 Reports of a video being shared on TikTok about 'National Rape Day' have sparked concerns Credit: Alamy

Users are urging women to stay inside after the video supposedly emerged

Police in Hampshire said they had spoken to the child who ""was afraid of being raped"" and warned her actions could have had ""dire consequences"".

Officers said they recovered the blades but did not arrest her, instead offering reassurance and crime prevention advice.

The supposed hoax started on popular video sharing app TikTok but has since spread to other social media platforms.

Women have been warned to stay indoors after rumours of the stomach-churning threats for April 24 were released.

The alleged original clip cannot be located - and may never have existed in the first place - but thousands of related videos exist.

And the hashtag #April24 has been viewed more than 118.2million times.

People have been warned to 'be careful'

The disturbing 'trend' has sparked panic online, with users advising women to lock their doors and even stay inside all day.

Charities have slammed reports of a 'National Rape Day', highlighting the dangers of such a ""distressing"" supposed ""joke"", even if it was not intended to be taken seriously.

One campaigner described the idea of a day where laws are suspended and rape is legal as ""abhorrent"".

Katie Russell, from Rape Crisis England & Wales, told The Sun Online: ""Regardless of its origins, or whether or not it was intended as a ‘joke’ at any point, the very concept of such a day is abhorrent and has caused many people, particularly women and girls, a great deal of understandable fear.

""The ‘trend’ will no doubt have also been extremely distressing for many, not least of all victims and survivors of rape and all forms of sexual violence and abuse who might have had vivid memories and flashbacks to past experiences triggered by this.

""Rape and sexual assault are always serious crimes. It should also go without saying that rape and all forms of sexual violence and abuse are traumatic experiences that can and do have wide-ranging and long-lasting impacts, and are never appropriate topics to ‘joke’ about.""

Regardless of its origins, or whether or not it was intended as a ‘joke’ at any point, the very concept of such a day is abhorrent and has caused many people, particularly women and girls, a great deal of understandable fear. Katie Russell, Rape Crisis

And Andrea Simon, director of End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: ""We wouldn't accept threats to rape offline and we can't ignore them online.

""They intend to intimidate and silence women in online spaces, causing real harm to individuals and to society and should never be tolerated.""

Police said that while ""at the risk of highlighting something that does not deserve to be highlighted"", they felt that it was ""important to provide some information about a hoax social media post"".

In a post on Facebook, Southampton cops continued: ""Not only is this hoax disgusting, making light of one of the most serious, most traumatic offences a human can commit against another, it is also causing many children to be very afraid.

""Today we had to speak to an 11-year-old girl who took two knives into school because she had heard it was almost National Rape Day and she was afraid of being raped.

'DIRE CONSEQUENCES'

""(We have recovered the knives, and no, we didn’t arrest her. We have provided reassurance and crime prevention advice to her and her parents.)

""Had the knives not been recovered this could have had dire consequences had this child lashed out in fear for any reason.

""Parents, please reassure your children that the hoax in question is exactly that: a hoax.

""It is NOT true and they definitely do not need to arm themselves for protection.

""And if you or your children see the “joke” post in question, please report it to the social media platform so they can take action and DO NOT share it as it simply spreads fear and anxiety, particularly among school and college aged children.""

Rumours of the video have also spread on WhatsApp groups with students in Cornwall saying they are afraid to go outside.

A spokesperson for Falmouth University said any messages encouraging sexual violence were ""abhorrent"" but there was ""no evidence"" of a genuine threat.

Devon and Cornwall Police are looking into claims around the encrypted chat which has reportedly been discussing “Rape Day”.

A force spokesperson said: “Police have received a report of the existence of the WhatsApp group and are currently making enquiries regarding the credibility of the group.”

TikTok has claimed it cannot locate the original video but has asked users to report any content related to the sick day.

A spokesperson for the platform told The Sun Online: ""The supposed 'National Rape Day' trend being reported upon is abhorrent and would be a direct violation of our Community Guidelines, and while we haven't seen evidence of this trending on our platform, our safety team remains vigilant and would remove any such content.""

Users of the app are being urged to report any posts promoting the event or sexual assault of any kind.

Police were informed about the girl's disappearance on October 16 and an investigation was launched.

The following day, the girl's body was found near a pond in the border of Moti Bhakhar village, The Times of India reports.

Her head was located ""some distance of the body"" and early investigations suggested the girl was raped before the killing, police said.

Dr Kushal Ojha, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Deesa, said: ""The case came to light when Dantiwada police found a decapitated body near the pond near Moti Bhakhar village.

""A day earlier, police were informed of the disappearance of a 12-year-old girl from the area.

The police officer said that police immediately started the investigation in the case and searched the CCTV footage of the area nearby for clues, according to New Indian Express.

""In CCTV footage the accused Nitin Mali, cousin of the deceased, was found to be riding with the victim on his bike,"" he said.

He added: ""[A] primary investigation revealed that Nitin raped the victim and later beheaded her due to the fear of getting exposed.""

Rajulben Desai, Member of National Commission for Women, who visited the area, said attacks on women were on the rise.

""The increasing incidence of atrocities and rapes against women, especially minors, is of great concern to society,"" she said.

The body of the victim was sent for a post-mortem and further investigations are ongoing.

Earlier this month, hundreds of protesters demanded the dismissal of the government of a northern Indian state where a 19-year-old woman was allegedly gang raped and later died in a hospital.

The demonstrators shouted ""Hang the rapists"" and ""First raped by devils, then by the system"" as they gathered near Parliament in New Delhi.

The protesters, including Bollywood actress Swara Bhaskar, said the Uttar Pradesh state government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party did not allow anyone to meet the victim’s family and that police cordoned off their village.

In India, rape and sexual violence have been under the spotlight since the 2012 gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus.

The attack sparked massive protests and inspired politicians to order the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases and stiffen penalties for those convicted of the crime.

This year has already seen a string of attacks on women in India.

The 49-year-old then cut her body up and dumped her remains in eight different plastic bags at a recycling centre.

Sickeningly, McCann then used the 46-year-old's phone to send messages to their three children pretending to be his wife.

Yvonne's remains were found by a dog walker at Reddish Vale Country Park, near Stockport, Greater Manchester but only 50 per cent of her body has been found.

McCann told police he was ""Hannibal Lecter"" and confessed: ""I killed my wife and disposed of her like garbage"".

He has now been caged for life with a minimum of 13 years and four months after admitting murder at Manchester Crown Court.

The couple's daughter said in a statement: ‘’Their relationship was good in the early days and although they argued like most couples their relationship appeared good to me.

""She was a full time mum to us, she would take us to school and always bought us things. We got whatever we wanted and never went without.

""She absolutely loved sunshine and would take us on holidays abroad when she could. She loved music and would always have music on full blast when she cleaned the house.

""We have all had to come to terms with the realisation that the person they found in the country park was our mum and then the realisation that our dad caused her death.

‘’We love our mum very much but we love our dad and realise he will go to prison for a very long time, but we hope he gets the help he needs.’’

BRUTAL MURDER

The court heard the couple, who have three grown up children, were childhood sweethearts and married in November 1996.

During the second May bank holiday weekend last year, the pair rowed over a bag of chips they had to chuck after Yvonne forgot to freeze them.

Prosecutor Andrew Smith said: ""Seemingly the trigger was some used frozen chips.""

Raging McCann then strangled his wife in the bathroom then dismembered her body in the bath.

He had sent texts from Yvonne's phones to their children suggesting she was still alive.

McCann also continued working as a delivery driver and messaged tragic Yvonne ""I love you"" in a bid to cover his tracks.

But he was caught repeatedly carrying items to the recycling centre before throwing them in a skip.

Chillingly, he was seen dumping parts of Yvonne's body after messaging her: ""Missing you so much, I hope we can sort this out, forgive me I don’t want to lose you.""

McCann later took his daughter to buy groceries for a BBQ where he got drunk and was described as ''stumbling and falling over.''

Suspicions were raised when he was taken home and found to have his wife's mobile phone and ear rings in his pocket.

Baroness Jones, who sits in the House of Lords, said in a debate on domestic violence that it could help cut down cases of discrimination too.

It comes after human remains were found last night in the case of Sarah Everard, who went missing after leaving a friends' house in Clapham last week.

Cops haven't yet confirmed it is her, but a serving Met Police cop has been arrested over her kidnap and murder.

Speaking in the House of Lords last night Baroness Jones said: ""In the week that Sarah Everard was abducted and, we suppose, killed — because remains have been found in a woodland in Kent — I argue that, at the next opportunity for any Bill that is appropriate, I might put in an amendment to create a curfew for men on the streets after 6pm.

""I feel this would make women a lot safer, and discrimination of all kinds would be lessened.""

She later admitted it wouldn't be a feasible idea in practise - but wanted to highlight it shouldn't be women who should be having to change their behaviour.

A Government source last night dismissed the suggestion as ""totally bonkers"". They said it would be a ""massive curtailing of basic freedoms and rights"" and would never work.

Caroline Nokes, Tory MP and Chair of the Women and Equalities Committee also said it was a mad suggestion.

She told The Sun: ""You can't go around slapping curfews on one gender.

""Any solution to the real fear that women feel is going to have to be a lot more complex than that.

""Its a bonkers suggestion - but it has got us all talking about what practical steps men can take to make women feel safer.""

Even the Women's Equality Party said it might not work.

Mandu Reid, Leader of the party said last night: “After a year of lockdowns, the last thing we need is more reasons to stop people going out.

""That’s why politicians and police should step up and take responsibility for making sure women can leave their homes free from the fear of violence. It’s about making ending violence against women a priority.”

Baroness Jones went on to back a cross-party bid to make misogyny and hatred against women a specific hate crime.

Baroness Jones said: ""If anyone is being advised to stay at home it should be men, not women.

“This kind of murder is rare, but very scary. What is far more regular are the sexual assaults, threats, intimidation, cat calling and rude remarks that women face every day.

“If the police did their job this misogynistic culture wouldn't thrive the way it has. Men wouldn't assume that they could get away with it. The police have failed on rape and sexual assault for years. They have mostly failed on domestic abuse. There needs to be some serious action at the Met to turn this around and give women the protection they deserve.

“We need to make misogyny a hate crime, as that would get the root of many of these other crimes.""

An amendment to the Domestic Abuse Bill - due to be debated in Parliament on Monday - would require all police forces in England and Wales to record where existing crimes have been motivated by hatred of someone’s sex or gender.

It comes as...

Sarah vanished last week as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham, South West London - and hasn't been seen since.

She left there around 9pm, phoned her boyfriend on the way, but is believed never to have arrived home.

PC Wayne Couzens, 48, was last night being held on suspicion of her abduction and murder.

The 48-year-old father-of-two is a Met Police armed diplomatic protection officer stationed in Westminster.

The Metropolitan Police last night confirmed human remains have been found in Ashford, Kent, but said they had not yet been identified.

It is 30 miles from the Deal home where Met Police gun cop was arrested on Tuesday night on suspicion of Sarah’s kidnap.

It's not believed the pair knew each other beforehand.

One line of inquiry is that he may have lured Sarah into his vehicle out of view of CCTV cameras.

His work saw him provide protection at major public events attended by senior members of the Royal Family.

It comes after thousands of women have taken to social media to share stories about how they too don't feel safe on Britain's streets.

A vigil is being held in Clapham, South London, at the weekend, for women to ""take back control"" of the streets, amid an outpouring of fear and emotion.

The head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick tried to reassure women last night it was still safe, but admitted people would be scared.

Shesaid: ""I know Londoners will want to know that it is thankfully incredibly rare for a woman to be abducted from our streets.

""But I completely understand that despite this, women in London and the wider public - particularly those in the area where Sarah went missing - will be worried and may well be feeling scared.""

This morning Home Secretary Priti Patel vowed to do more to make sure that women feel safe walking home.

The two brothers, Aaron Schwartz, 22, and Petie Schwartz, 18, earlier this month plead guilty to two counts of third-degree child molestation with a child under age 14, according to the Webster County Citizen.

When their sister was the victim of the sexual acts last year and earlier this year, she was 12 and 13 years old.

The Schwartz brothers’ plea deal included 10-year suspended prison terms, with five years of probation.

“These two young men would’ve been eaten alive in the state prison system,” Webster County prosecutor Ben Berkstresser said.

Berkstresser said he has previously been “very harsh on the Amish” with crime charges of the same nature.

But “in this instance, these two boys are very immature relative to their respective ages. Maturity wise, they are much younger than their age,” Berkstresser said.

Meanwhile, the two younger brothers did not face any charges because of their age.

“There were four brothers, two of them minors, while the other two legally are adults,” Berkstresser said.

“All of them had sexual relations with their sister. There is no question this occurred.”

The sister became pregnant as a result of the rapes and gave birth earlier this month at just 13 years old.

Her brothers’ crimes in Seymour, Missouri, became known after she saw a doctor about her pregnancy, and the doctor informed police.

The teenage girl then told law enforcement officials that she was sexually abused by her four brothers.

“One of the brothers is the father of this child,” Berkstresser said.

“But within the Amish community that primarily lives in the Seymour area, [the Amish] don’t see the authority we have to do anything to them. This was a tough case to prosecute.”

It is not known which of her brothers got her pregnant.

The Amish are traditionalist Christian and shun technology.

Despite outrage over the older brothers’ sentence, Berkstresser has refused to change his decision.

Berkstresser gave each of the Schwartz brothers $250 fines, 100 hours of community service and demanded that they write letters on how they will protect their children from inflicting such abuse.

The woman, 29, was travelling around Thailand as a tourist before starting to look for work - and was hired at a language school.

But as she celebrated her new post, the woman used Tinder to arrange a beach date with a 36-year-old Frenchman on the island of Phuket last Monday, September 7.

The man is alleged to have taken the woman back to his hotel room where she says he brutally raped her three times.

However, the suspect was arrested on Tuesday afternoon following a dramatic police chase.

Today, police confirmed via telephone that the man had been arrested and was being held in custody on suspicion of the “rape of a person over 15 years old by use of threat or force.”

Investigating officer Police Lieutenant Colonel Chompunoot Anantayakul, of Patong police station, said: “The suspect was married to a Thai woman but they divorced.

“He had lost his job because of the pandemic. He met the alleged victim on a dating app and they went to his room.

“She said that he raped her three times by using force and she had marks on her wrist that came from the alleged attack.”

Following the ordeal, the alleged victim contacted the British Embassy on September 8 and was taken to hospital for medical checks.

She had also allegedly suffered injuries on her wrist during the alleged rape.

A police complaint was lodged on Friday, September 11, and officers issued an arrest warrant and began searching for the suspect.

Police traced the man, who was found driving a white Nissan Juke on yesterday afternoon, before giving chase and radioing for a road block to be put in place.

The suspect was hauled out of the car and arrested in handcuffs.

He allegedly admitted having sex with the British woman but denies raping her.

He has now been remanded in custody while the investigation proceeds.

Lieutenant Colonel Chompunoot Anantayakul said: “This is a serious case and we are gathering all of the evidence available, including from CCTV cameras and from the suspect's phone.

“The victim was travelling and came to Thailand as a tourist before looking for a job as a teacher. She finally found one in Nakhon Sawan province in the north.

He is said to have stabbed him after visiting the grave of his dead father David just hours before the alleged attack.

Schreiber's mum and Sir Sutton's wife Anne Schreiber, 65, was also found to have suffered knife wounds and was left in a “critical” condition in hospital.

Three hours after the killing, police dramatically stopped Schreiber's Range Rover in Hammersmith, west London, after tracking it across five counties.

The 34-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder and police later confirmed he was known to the victim.

He was then charged with murder, attempted murder and dangerous driving in connection to the probe.

Prosecutor Siobhan Oxley said the dangerous driving charge related to the Schrieber driving the Range Rover “along the A303 and the M3”.

Schreiber - who was barely audible through the mask - spoke only to confirm his date of birth and gave his address as Sir Richard’s Dorset home.

Chairman Caroline Foster remanded him in custody until his next appearance tomorrow at Winchester Crown Court.

8 Police vehicles arrived at the scene

Dorset Police received a report raising concern for the welfare of the occupants of an address in Higher Langham near Gillingham at 7.30pm on April 7.

Officers found Sir Richard Sutton, who owned a string of top hotels in London, and Anne Schreiber with serious injuries at the property.

The force said it is believed both were stabbed.

Paramedics attended the scene but Sir Richard, 83, was pronounced dead at around 9.15pm.

An initial post-mortem examination conducted on Friday indicated that the cause of his death was stab wounds to his chest.

Detective Inspector Simon Huxter, of Dorset Police, said: ""Our thoughts remain with the victims' family and all of those affected by this terrible incident.

""Following a detailed investigation, we have consulted with the Crown Prosecution Service.

""As a result, Dorset Police have been authorised to formally charge Thomas Schreiber with the murder of Sir Richard, attempted murder of the injured woman and dangerous driving.

""It is important to stress that it would be entirely inappropriate for Dorset Police to comment further ahead of the trial. It is vital that the criminal justice system is allowed to follow its course.""

A spokesman for Sir Richard Sutton Ltd described Ms Schreiber as ""a hugely important part of Sir Richard's life"" and wished her ""a swift and full recovery"".

She was airlifted to Southmead Hospital in Bristol following the incident and remains there in a critical condition.

The spokesman added: ""Though separated, Sir Richard also remained on good terms with his wife, Lady Fiamma, and very close to their children, who are mourning the loss of a devoted father.

""Employees across the group have been united in their shock at what has happened and will need time to come to terms with the loss of such an influential figure.""

Police taped off part of Brandon Country Park after the body was found in the water

Her husband Andrius Vengalis, 46, was arrested five hours after her body was recovered on April 9 and was charged with her murder three days later.

Ms Vengaliene, who was originally from Lithuania, had lived in the UK for seven years.

Her family said in a tribute: ""Egle Vengaliene, at the age of only 35-years-old, passed away on 9th April, 2021.

“She was loving, caring and devoted to her family, radiating optimism, cheerfulness and positive energy and believing in her family's bright future.

“She leaves behind five of her children, who will have to grow up without their mother's love and will always long and mourn their mother.

""Protect your children from heaven and rest in peace, Egle.”

MURDER PROBE

Vengalis appeared before magistrates via video link on April 13 and was committed to appear before Ipswich Crown Court.

The court was told that Ms Vengaliene’s provisional cause of death was drowning, according to a post mortem by a Home Office pathologist.

Prosecutor Wayne Ablett added: ""There was a wound to the neck, and ligature marks, but neither of these are believed to have been the cause of death.""

Vengalis who lived with Ms Vengaliene in Brandon, was remanded in custody pending a potential plea hearing on July 19.

The investigation is ongoing and officers remain keen to hear from anybody who knew Egle and have not yet been in contact with police, or from anyone with a recent sighting of her prior to 7am on the morning of Friday, April 9. Suffolk Police

A Suffolk Police statement said today: “The investigation is ongoing and officers remain keen to hear from anybody who knew Egle and have not yet been in contact with police, or from anyone with a recent sighting of her prior to 7am on the morning of Friday, April 9.

“Detectives are continuing to appeal for witnesses, particularly anyone who was in the area of Brandon Country Park or Bury Road in Brandon and the surrounding streets, and who may have seen or heard anything suspicious.

“Additionally, officers are asking anyone who was driving in the vicinity of Brandon Country Park or Bury Road, Brandon, between midnight and 7am on Friday 9 April and who has a dashcam in their vehicle, to make contact with the inquiry team.”

'BELOVED' MUM

A friend who set up a Facebook fundraiser to help take Ms Vengaliene's remains back to Lithuania has paid tribute to her.

The pal, Vitalija, said Ms Vengaliene was a ""beloved daughter and sister"" and mourned that there are ""five kids left without a mom"" following her tragic death.

She told MailOnline that Ms Vengaliene was a ""good mother"" and a ""pretty woman"".

The pals had lived in the UK for about seven years and were both from Rokiškis in Lithuania.

The Facebook post said: ""We express our condolences to the family, for the loss of beloved daughter and sister Egl in England.

""Five kids left without mom. It's hard to find words to comfort you today.

""We express all strength, hope and faith to you, your family and loved ones.

""And we ask all Lithuanians for financial help to transport their body to Lithuania.""

Jessa, 28, and her husband, Ben Seewald, 25, broke their silence after it was revealed that her older brother was being charged with two counts of child pornography.

In their Instagram stories, the couple shared Saturday: ""We are saddened to hear about the charges against Josh.

""As Christians, we stand against any form of pornography or abuse and we desire for the truth to be exposed, whatever that may be.

""Our prayers are with their family as they walk through this difficult time.""

Fans will also know that, back in 2015, Jessa, along with her sister Jill, revealed she was one of the female minors that Josh had molested in the early 2000s.

Jessa joined her sister Jinger in condemning Josh for his actions as the mom of two shared on her Instagram on Friday: ""We are disturbed to hear the charges against Josh.

""While this case must go through the legal system, we want to make it clear that we absolutely condemn any form of child abuse and fully support the authorities and judicial process in their pursuit of justice.""

A source told The Sun exclusively that the couple will attempt to ""distance themselves"" from their brother.

""Jinger and Jeremy have told friends they are disgusted by the charges against Josh.

""They don’t want anything to do with him while this is ongoing and are distancing themselves from it all.

""They’ve been shaken by what is happening, especially Jinger.

“They are in constant touch with family, but their children are their primary focus, and it’s devastating for everyone involved.”

On the other hand, their cousin Amy was speechless and revealed her shock to The Sun exclusively.

She said: “At the moment I have no comment to make. I’m kind of speechless, we just hope it’s not true.

“I spoke with several of my cousins after we heard about the arrest. We’re in shock, but we don’t want to think the worst of someone, you want to think the best.

“If it is true it would absolutely devastate a lot of people.”

Amy, who is married to Dillon King, continued: “Everybody that knows Josh would be devastated. Just thinking about it makes me want to have a glass of wine right now.”

She added that her “hugs” go out to Josh’s pregnant wife Anna, 32, and their six children.

The clothing boutique owner ended: “It breaks my heart. Family is family and I wish the best for everyone.”

18 Josh was arrested on two charges of child pornography Credit: Splash

These statements came just moments after Josh was charged with two counts of child pornography on Friday.

According to the indictment, Josh “knowingly received child pornography” between or about May 14, 2019 and on or about May 16, 2019.

For the second count, Josh “knowingly possessed material that contained images of child pornography,” including “images of minors under the age of 12.”

Josh has been ordered to forfeit all visual images and property, including video equipment, related to the case.

According to a press release from the Department of Justice, Josh “allegedly used the internet to download child sexual abuse material. Duggar allegedly possessed this material, some of which depicts the sexual abuse of children under the age of 12, in May 2019.”

If convicted, he could receive 20 years in prison with fines up to $250,000 on each count.

Josh appeared from jail via zoom for his arraignment on Friday afternoon, as he obtained a lawyer and pleaded not guilty to the charges.

A detention hearing has been set for May 5 at 1:30pm to determine if he could be released on bail, as the government requested he remain behind bars.

If released, the judge said Josh must reside with a third party.

She said at the hearing: ""The court would likely require a third party custodian that he could reside with that would ensure compliance with the conditions of bond.

""It would need to be a residence where there are no minors in the home. You would need to look for somebody who could ensure to the court that there are no minors in the home or would be visiting unsupervised.""

18 He was arrested on Thursday Credit: Getty

The Sun previously broke Josh was arrested for the federal charges in Washington County at 1:15 pm on Thursday afternoon.

An insider claimed Josh ""turned himself in"" without incident.

The head-turning revelation is related to the 2019 Homeland Security raid on Josh's now-shuttered used car dealership in Springdale, Arkansas, another source told The Sun.

In November 2019, Homeland Security conducted an “ongoing federal investigation” at the lot, but no charges were filed against Josh - until now.

A source exclusively told The Sun of patriarch Jim Bob, 55, his wife Michelle, 54, and their 19 children: ""The family has known that this has been coming for weeks, and Josh has been preparing himself.

""They are praying together for Josh and Anna, who is standing by her husband as she always has.

""Family members are extremely concerned by what is happening and they just want to find out the truth.

""They know that this will put them in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons, and are stunned they are having to go through this again.""

The insider added: ""The family will be speaking out shortly and hope this in many ways will bring them closer together and even closer to God.""

Josh's wife, Anna, 32, announced she is pregnant with the couple's seventh child just last week with a gender reveal video.

The arrest comes six years after In Touch Weekly uncovered a 33-page Arkansas police report claiming Jim Bob confessed to local authorities that his eldest son fondled the breasts and genitals of young girls while they were asleep in the Duggar family home back in 2002.

Following the allegations against him, Josh addressed the claim: ""Twelve years ago, as a young teenager, I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret.

""I hurt others, including my family and close friends.""

Josh was never charged with any crime related to the incidents.

His younger sisters Jill, 29, and Jessa, 28, came forward as two of the victims in an interview with Megyn Kelly, where they insisted they had forgiven Josh for his sins.

More allegations followed for Josh, as another report just three months later claimed the former TLC star was using adultery dating service Ashley Madison.

He said: ""I have been the biggest hypocrite ever. While espousing faith and family values, I have secretly over the last several years been viewing pornography on the Internet and this has become a secret addiction and I became unfaithful to my wife.""

Soon after, porn star Danica Dillon, whose real name is Ashley Johnston, claimed he assaulted her during a sexual encounter.

In a 2020 interview with The Sun, Ashley, 33, described the alleged incident as being so intense ""it felt like this guy tried to kill me.""

Ashley, now a married mom of four, said Josh ""knows what he's done and has to live with his demons.""

But who's responsible for the dark web's notorious ""red rooms"", and are they real or an urban myth?

What is a red room?

Red rooms are rumoured online spaces within the dark web, the shadowy underbelly of the internet, used to hide illegal activity online.

According to online reports, they're murky spots where sickos can pay to watch live streamed videos, of rape, torture, murder, and worse.

Users are said to pay thousands, or even tens of thousands, for access to the dark clips.

Urban legends surrounds red rooms have circulated for years, but so far no evidence has emerged that they exist.

Their name is thought to have originated from the 1983 horror film Videodrome, where torture is shown live on TV in a red-painted room.

Alternatively, it's been suggested the phrase arose from ""Red Rum"", which spells ""murder"" backwards.

Are red rooms a myth?

While red rooms have generated plenty of discussion on social media over the years, there's no evidence that they exist.

Even if they had cropped up in some grim corner of the internet, it's not clear how anyone could run one.

Tor – the special web browser needed to access the dark web – couldn't run the rooms, as it's too slow to support live-streamed video.

Other secretive browsers would also struggle to host the streams, as they run their web traffic through multiple servers.

One case that suggests there might be sites where people pay to view disturbing, illegal content is that of depraved paedophile Peter Scully.

The former property developer would entice impoverished children with money and gifts back to his home in the Philippines.

He then drugged the vulnerable youngsters and made films of him raping and torturing them for an international paedophile ring.

Operating a secret child pornography site on the Dark Web, he sold the videos for up to $10,000 per view.

In one sickening case, Aussie sex attacker Scully, 57, dubbed one of the world’s worst paedophiles, made two little girls dig their own graves.

What is the dark web?

The internet is actually made up of three different layers: the surface web, the deep web and the dark web.

The top layer, the surface web, are web pages that show up using search engines such as Google - like The Sun website that you're looking at right now.

The deep web are web pages which search engines can't access and are therefore hidden, accessed via passwords and authorisation.

Any time you log into an account you're accessing deep web content that won't show up on a search engine.

4 Users of the dark web access websites using special browsers and software Credit: Getty Images

For example, work intranets, password-protected areas of online banking and draft blog posts are all stored on the deep web.

This means that if someone was to Google your name, your banking information or Amazon wishlist won't show up in the results.

The dark web is a network of untraceable online activity and websites on the internet. They cannot be found using search engines and to access them you need to use specific software, configurations or have authorisation. They are used by lots of different people to keep their web activity hidden.

Where did the dark web come from?

The dark web was actually created by the US government to allow spies to exchange information completely anonymously.

US military researchers developed the technology, known as Tor (The Onion Router) in the mid-1990s and released it into the public domain for everyone to use.

The reason was so that they could stay anonymous - it would be harder to distinguish the government's messages between spies if thousands of other people were using the same system for lots of different things. Tor now hosts roughly 30,000 hidden sites.

It's called The Onion Router because it uses the technique of onion routing - making websites anonymous through layers of encryption. Most websites are also hosted on the .onion domain.

What is the government doing about the dark web?

On April 11, Home Secretary Amber Rudd launched a multi-million pound cyber blitz on criminals selling guns on the dark web.

She announced a £9million fund to ensure every police force in the UK has a dedicated cyber crime unit to bust its ""sickening shopping list of services and products"".

The extra cash will tackle offenders who are exploiting the anonymity of the dark web - where users use freely available software to avoid being tracked - to trade in guns, drugs and child abuse images.

This anonymity has attracted criminals seeking to avoid detection by law enforcement agencies.

Dad-of-two Wayne Couzens, 48, is in custody after the 33-year-old went missing last week as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham, south west London.

Sarah Everard, a marketing manager, should have made it back to her Brixton home by about 10pm on Wednesday night - but hasn't been seen since.

And in a ""shocking and deeply disturbing"" update to the case, Scotland Yard last night revealed a police officer had been arrested over Sarah's disappearance.

The Sun can today reveal Wayne Couzens, an armed diplomatic protection officer based in Westminster, was arrested at his Kent home.

His work saw him provide protection at major public events attended by senior members of the Royal Family with the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command also responsible for guarding Downing Street and the Palace of Westminster.

Met Police this afternoon confirmed a serving officer was arrested last night on suspicion of kidnap.

They said he was further arrested today on suspicion of murder and a separate allegation of indecent exposure.

PC Couzens is thought to have been a late entrant to the police, joining around 10 years ago after previously working at a family garage repairs business in Dover.

One ex-colleague of PC Couzens said: ""It is truly shocking that he has been arrested over Sarah's disappearance.""

However despite the arrest, the Met said Ms Everard had not yet been found.

Detectives investigating Sarah’s disappearance are also today carrying out a search of his locker at the police base in the Palace of Westminster where he worked.

Following the arrest of the police officer, the Metropolitan Police has made a referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.

Neighbour David Ladd, 48, said he saw Couzens bundled into a police car under arrest with handcuffs on last night.

He told The Sun: “He was escorted into the back of a police car.”

Cops are now standing guard at a Kent home with a forensic tent set up outside, with a car seized from outside the property.

A woman in her 30s - believed to be the cop's partner - was also been arrested at the same location on suspicion of assisting an offender. She remains in custody.

Corrine Couzens, Wayne’s step-mother, told The Sun she couldn't comment but added: ""I'm aware of what's happening.""

Cops were today seen searching locations in London and Kent including a property in Deal and an area of woodland near Ashford.

Officers have been combing through through bushes at a disused paintball centre and a golf driving range.

Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave last night said the arrest was a ""serious and significant development"".

AC Ephgrave said: ""We will continue to work with all speed on this investigation but the fact that the arrested man is a serving Metropolitan Police officer is both shocking and deeply disturbing.

""I understand there will be significant public concern but it is essential that the investigative team are given the time and space to continue their work.""

The Directorate of Professional Standards is aware and Sarah's family has been kept updated of these developments, police said.

'IT'S HORRIFYING'

And as cops searched the officer's Kent home, neighbours spoke of their shock.

A neighbour in the road said a police officer lives at the address with his ""chatty"" wife and two children.

She said: ""They just seemed like a normal, regular family, there was nothing strange about them at all.""

Pamela Cane, 77, who lives opposite, described the household as “the perfect family”.

She said Wayne lived there with his wife, two young children and a Pug dog.

She said her late partner Rod would discuss policing with Wayne - who she described as “very friendly” and part of a “perfect family”.

She said: “The whole situation is horrifying.

“I can’t believe this. The arrest is more shocking because he’s a police officer.

“Wayne would also fix bikes in his garage. He was known for helping people with them.”

A woman who lives nearby was walking past Couzens’ home about 8pm last night when she saw him arrested by about 25 plain clothes police officers outside the property.

The neighbour told The Sun: “There were two officers at the door and some more positioned to the side of the house.""

FINGERTIP SEARCH

Sarah was last seen on Wednesday night - seen on a doorbell camera on the Poynders Road section of the South Circular - about halfway between her friend's house and her own flat.

Detectives searching for the missing marketing executive earlier cordoned off a main road to search a housing complex close to where Sarah's phone last pinged.

Officers carried out fingertip searches around Clapham Common where Sarah was last seen, while divers and sniffer dogs checked ponds and drains in the area.

And police have appealed for motorists who may have driving near her route home to send in their dash-cam footage.

Police yesterday released new pictures of missing Sarah hoping that it might encourage anyone with information to come forward.

One shows Sarah wearing the same coat as on the night she went missing.

Sarah’s parents left their York home at the weekend and drove to London to help the search for their daughter.

Her distraught family fear ""bad people approached her"" as her ""very worried"" boyfriend issued a desperate plea.

Her uncle Nick Everard also revealed the family are ""absolutely distraught"" - and said they were ""baffled"" by the arrest.

He told the Sun Online: ""We know they arrested an armed officer but we don't know him.

""It’s really shocked us all.

He had earlier pleaded with any potential abductor to ""just to be human and to let her come home"".

Nick added: “If someone is holding her against her will I would plead with them just to be human and to let her come home, to let her talk to us, give us a ring or text to let us know she is OK.""

The Prime Minister's official spokesman told a Westminster briefing Boris Johnson's thoughts are with missing woman Sarah Everard and her friends.

They said: ""As investigations are ongoing on this case I can't comment.

""But the Prime Minister's thoughts are with Sarah and her friends and family.""

Sarah's boyfriend Josh Lowth, who spoke to Sarah on the phone for around 15 minutes before she vanished, has appealed for information on Facebook.

He wrote: ""Sarah is still missing. Please share this post to help us to find her. Today, more than ever, we miss our strong, beautiful friend.""

A relative also revealed today Josh is ""very worried"" as the search enters its seventh day.

His dad Chris added: ""We are concerned, like everybody is. We really, really want to see her back.""

It is understood detectives investigating her disappearance have been told of assaults on women in the area, reports The Times.

In January, Metropolitan Police received a report of sexual harassment on a young female on Hydethorpe Road, just half a mile from where Sarah was last caught on CCTV.

At the start of February, a woman was witnessed being chased by a man just over a mile away.

Then, just three weeks ago, a 14-year-old girl was followed by a man in a van less than half a mile from where Sarah was last seen.

Meanwhile, other women said they reported groups of men following a woman in neighbouring district Balham.

But Scotland Yard has said it is so far not linking Sarah's disappearance to any other incidents.

Alarmed women living in the area revealed police urged them to be vigilant after the mysterious disappearance.

One said cops knocked on her door last night and warned her ""not to go out alone"" as they desperately try to piece together what happened.

Another woman, aged in her 30s, told The Sun Online: “I was told to be more careful because I live on my own.

“The police came round yesterday and said to be careful.

“I don’t want to leave the house at the moment. You don’t know what happened.

“It makes me very worried. I just can’t believe it.”

Clues to find Sarah Officers are also asking people in the following areas to check doorbell or dashcam footage for any sightings of Sarah: The A205 South Circular around Clapham Common

On Wednesday night last week, Sarah left a friend's house in Leathwaite Road in Clapham about 9pm.

She headed through a back gate onto the A205 South Circular before she is believed to have walked across Clapham Common.

She had spoken to her partner on the phone for about 15 minutes, and has not been heard from since that point, according to her friend Rose Woollard.

Sarah moved to the capital for work around 12 years ago and has a brother, James, and sister, Katie, who also live in London.

In a statement released over the weekend, her family said: ""With every day that goes by we are getting more worried about Sarah.

""She is always in regular contact with us and with her friends and it is totally out of character for her to disappear like this.

""We long to see her and want nothing more than for her to be found safe and well.

""We are so grateful to the police and all our friends for all they are doing.

""We are desperate for news and if anyone knows anything about what has happened to her, we would urge you to please come forward and speak to the police.

""No piece of information is too insignificant.""

Sarah’s sister, Katie, added on Facebook: “No words. Please share and contact me if you hear anything.”

Sitting between her unconscious parents, the tiny child's ears pricked at the familiar sound and she walked over, crouching down to collect the package of brown stones.

Knowing exactly what to do, she then took the drugs to her sprawled-out mum, shaking her awake.

It was a heartbreaking scene - yet for drug runner Joey, it was just one of countless sights that sickened him to the core as he delivered smack for a notorious Irish gangster.

Barely out of primary school when he was groomed into a life of crime, Joey spent years being fed cocaine, brutally beaten and even shot at by ruthless drug kingpin Brian Kenny.

He called me 'Joey The Lips'

He also claims he was raped by Kenny, who branded him ""Joey The Lips"" and forced him to live in his countryside hideout, packed with an arsenal of guns and stolen goods.

Threatened with death if he tried to escape, Joey had no way out - yet when Kenny carried out a cold-blooded assassination, he finally broke the golden bond of gangland silence and went to police.

His evidence saw Kenny and mobster Thomas Hinchon caged for murder - with brave Joey, then aged 19, becoming the youngest ever person to enter the Witness Protection Programme.

Now, nearly two decades on, Joey is set to release an explosive new book - The Witness, with investigative journalist Nicola Tallant - about his ordeal at the hands of ""Jekyll and Hyde"" Kenny.

And in his first UK interview ahead of the book's publication this week, he tells Sun Online that he is still living as a ""ghost"", fearing one day he will be shot dead by the gangsters.

“I could die any day now. There's probably a good chance I’m going to die with a bullet because of what I’ve done,"" says Joey, now 35 and living under a different identity.

“I’ve been in a room by myself for the last 16 years. I can go to the shop, but I have to wear a bulletproof vest, a mask, a hat, a scarf around my face.

“There’s alarms all over my house, CCTV cameras everywhere. I have a panic alarm with me, all my windows are bulletproof.

""That’s the way I live my life.”

Speaking via video call from a secret location, he adds: ""I’ve done the sentence with them. The only difference between me and Kenny and Hinchon is I can open my door, they can’t.""

Joey, who spent time in England while in witness protection, first met Kenny in Blanchardstown, west Dublin, where the youngster and his family lived near infamous heroin gang The Westies.

At the time, Kenny was working as a milkman, knocking on doors to find new customers. But with Joey home alone, the gangster found a new recruit who could deliver milk and, eventually, something much deadlier.

“My Mam came home from work and I was like, ‘Oh my god Ma, you won’t believe it, I’m actually getting a job',"" Joey recalls.

""I was so happy, I was absolutely thrilled.""

From delivering milk to running heroin

At first, the schoolboy thought he was earning pocket money by simply delivering bottles of milk and collecting dockets around the estates - something he'd seen other boys doing.

""I know I’m small but I can run real fast,"" he eagerly promised Kenny, who had reassured Joey's mum his new job was keeping him away from The Westies across the road.

Yet as the summer holidays began and his shifts increased, Joey got his first glimpse of Kenny's violent side when the milkman beat up a young boy who had allegedly stolen from him.

""Brian stopped the van, took a hammer out from underneath the seat, jumped out, chased him, got him on the ground and smashed him all up,"" claims Joey.

""I could hear his screams, bones crack, everything.""

Afterwards, Kenny used milk to wash the blood off his hands. Then, in his first of endless threats to Joey, he snarled: ""That’s what’ll happen if you ever rob owt from me.""

Days later, still traumatised by what he'd witnessed, Joey found himself being handed a bag of heroin during a milk round. Though he didn't know exactly what it was, he could guess it was drugs.

""Brian said, 'You put it through the letterbox and you don’t move until you hear it drop. And make sure it f***ing drops,"" Joey tells us.

""I remember putting my hand through the door to drop it and the guy was actually at the other side, waiting for me. This was at 4am.""

He adds: “I didn’t even know what anxiety was, but I knew I was afraid... my body was shaking, my hands were sweating.”

“I remember going home, lying in bed and thinking, 'What if that guy dies? I gave him that, my fingerprints are on it'.""

Before long, Joey was being forced to deliver up to 300 bags a night. Later in the week, he'd collect £4,000 in smack payments along with the milk money, handing every penny to Kenny.

“I saw awful sights,"" Joey says.

""Kids on the rounds with their nappies hanging off them. Broken windows, boards up. It was just pure poverty, it was sadness.

""I remember one guy didn’t pay and [Kenny] went in and chopped him up with a machete. In the van, he had a gun under the seat.”

If Joey told anyone about the business, Kenny warned him, heroin would be planted in his mum's car. But incredibly, the illicit deliveries were only the start of the youngster's nightmare.

Drugged with cocaine & Valium

When the new school term started, Kenny refused to let Joey go back - instead giving him lines of cocaine to ""revv"" him up for the deliveries, and Valium to help his comedowns.

The gangster, Joey claims, also sexually abused him. What started off as lewd comments about Joey's lips - like “Oh the boys would love that"" - allegedly turned into sex attacks and rape.

""Brian was like Jekyll and Hyde,"" says Joey.

""One minute he could be hugging me, telling me I was his son and he loved me, the next minute he’d be beating the s*** out of me or abusing me.""

Eventually, Kenny - who modelled himself on telly gangster Tony Soprano - even forced Joey to move into his CCTV-laden mobsters' paradise, which was surrounded by an electric fence.

“If you tried to escape, you’d get electrocuted,"" says Joey.

""It was just a nightmare.”

'Raped' in gangster's man cave

At the mansion, Kenny would allegedly rape Joey in his 'man cave'.

He also started raiding mobile homes, stealing cars, and sending the teenager out on a motorbike to collect heroin, after his milk rounds drugs business was foiled by cops.

""This time, we were selling more than we ever were,"" Joey claims.

""We went from little bags to ounces. We’d have jeeps coming from England and they’d be full of heroin.""

Unbeknown to his family - who, ""like everyone"", believed Kenny was a good guy - Joey would spend his spare time weighing and bagging drugs in his attic bedroom.

""If I wasn’t bagging it, I was delivering it. It was 24 hours, seven days a week. Christmas morning, I’d be out delivering heroin,"" he recalls.

By the time he turned 18, Joey had started wearing gloves to bag the drugs because when he put his hands to his face, his lips were numb for hours. Trapped in Kenny's grip, he felt helpless.

Bloody gangland hit

But everything changed in 2004, when Kenny and accomplice Hinchon murdered 25-year-old Jonathan O'Reilly as he sat in a car outside a Dublin prison in a bloody gangland hit.

After the shooting, Joey claims, the pair returned to the mansion, washed themselves with petrol, then ordered him to chop up the clothes they'd been wearing and boil them on the stove.

“[Kenny] called me into the kitchen, handed me a gun and said, 'Go out to the field and hide that now',"" he adds.

""I just didn’t know what to do. We hid everything in the field. We had loads of stuff in the field - drugs, guns, money.

""But no-one had ever been murdered.”

At first, Kenny and Hinchon feared O'Reilly might not have died. But, Joey says, once it was confirmed he had, ""they were celebrating, jumping up and down, doing coke, smoking heroin, cheers-ing drinks"".

From then on, Joey knew he was living on borrowed time.

Armed with Kenny and Hinchon's biggest secret, the teenager began thinking: ""The only way I'm getting out is to be dragged across that field to be buried.”

Sometimes he used to hit me with a sewer rod and I couldn’t even walk. Without being rude, sometimes I was p***ing blood Joey O'Callaghan

His fears escalated when Kenny allegedly forced him to stand in the field and fired a shotgun above his head and at either side of his body.

As Joey stood shaking, the gangster then shoved the weapon in his mouth.

""He said, 'Look I could just blow your head off now, stick you in the ditch over there, and no-one would ever find you',"" claims Joey.

He adds: “The rape got worse, the abuse got worse.

“Sometimes he used to hit me with a sewer rod and I couldn’t even walk. Without being rude, sometimes I was p***ing blood.”

'Joey's life was no movie' AWARD-winning investigative journalist and The Witness author Nicola Tallant says children being groomed into drug gangs can't be ignored as something that ""just happens in working-class areas"". She tells Sun Online: “Joey O'Callaghan's story is so important in so many ways not least that he had a ringside seat in the secretive world of gangland for so long and is able to articulate what that is like in its rawest form. ""Joey's life was no movie, there was no happy ending. ""The fact that he was groomed into a drug gang as a young child and how that was done is a hugely important social issue for all of us and cannot be ignored by middle-class society as something that just happens in working-class areas. ""Many children are vulnerable to being picked up by gangs and it is something that we need to look at in the same way we do paedophilia."" Nicola adds: ""His experiences on the Witness Protection Programme give us a rare insight into a secretive and unaccountable world funded by the state and supposed to be a measure of society standing shoulder to shoulder with people who 'do the right thing'. ""Joey was used and abused by Brian Kenny but we also have to accept the grim fact that the same was done to him by the state. ""I have worked on the cutting edge of organised crime reporting for years. It is a dark place but I have learned to always look and listen and to show respect because sometimes there are good people there who don't belong. Joey was one of them.""

Amid his own terror, Joey couldn't stop thinking about Jonathan's family.

Eventually, despite knowing it could cut short his own life, he made the brave decision to escape from Kenny's home and report the murder and his boss to the Gardai.

“I knew Jonathan deserved justice, his family deserved justice,"" he tells us. ""I accepted my fate. I thought at least if I’m going to die, I’m going to die doing the right thing.""

Caged for murder

As a state witness, Joey's evidence won murder convictions against Kenny, then 36, and Hinchon, 25, who were jailed for life. The pair were also convicted of threatening to kill Joey.

In the following years, Joey experienced life on the Witness Protection Programme - which he describes in detail in his and Nicola's book. He says a lack of support left him destitute, alone and suicidal.

The courageous young man even spiralled back into drug use as he tried to fend for himself, while relocated miles away from his loved ones. Because of his ordeal, he says, he remains ""living like a ghost"".

It was Joey's devoted mum who ""dragged him back from Hell"".

He speaks fondly of her during our chat, saying she's his biggest supporter despite having her windows smashed, rats sprayed onto her home and her car nearly set alight.

""I don’t think I’d be alive today if I hadn’t had her,"" he says, ""because the world gave up on me and she was the person who still wanted me.""

'I live every day like it's my last'

Today, Joey - who ended up getting signed off the Programme - says he's in the best place he's ever been, with a job and regular medication, though he is rarely able to see his family.

When he does, he says, it's like a ""military operation"".

""I try to live every day just like it’s my last,"" he says. ""A lot of people don’t appreciate the moment until it’s gone. I don’t make long-term goals, I make short-term goals.”

Whenever he goes to work, Joey takes a different route and sneaks his bulletproof vest in with him. He shows us the protective vest during our call, lying within reach of him.

He says, over the years, he's become aware of bounties on his head. Though, he claims, gangland hits are carried out for as little as £2,000 a pop, his murder comes at a premium because he's considered ""a rat"".

“One time I was told it was £5,000 - another time it was £75,000,"" he says.

In recent years and months, Joey has become more fearful of his life, with Kenny being allowed out on day release to see his family and even being moved to an open prison.

But he says every time he thinks of Jonathan's mum - and her joy at getting justice - he knows he's done the right thing. He even carries a picture of Jonathan in his wallet in his memory.

""Until Kenny and Hinchon get me, I don’t think they’ll ever stop,"" says Joey, a father of two.

But he adds: “I have no regrets and I’d do it again tomorrow.
