https://nation.com.pk/18-Jul-2016/indian-rape-survivor-gang-raped-by-same-men-years-later?version=amp,,Indian rape survivor gang-raped by same men years later,"NEW DELHI: An Indian student was recovering in hospital after being gang-raped by a group of men including some charged with sexually assaulting her three years earlier, an officer said on Monday.

Police in Haryana state were hunting for the five, accused of abducting the 21-year-old student of the lowest Dalit social caste from outside her college before drugging and raping her in a car.

The student was found unconscious in bushes on the side of a highway last Wednesday night in Haryana which borders New Delhi, in the country’s latest shocking sexual attack.

Haryana deputy superintendent of police Pushpa Khatri said the student, who is still in hospital, has identified all five men — two of whom are currently on bail awaiting trial for raping her in 2013.

“She has identified the five accused and two of them were involved in the gang-rape of the student in Bhiwandi district in 2013,” Khatri told AFP. “We have formed several teams to arrest the accused.”

The woman’s family has accused the five of threatening them in the lead-up to Wednesday’s attack, demanding that they withdraw the rape case lodged after the 2013 assault.

“The accused were constantly threatening us to compromise outside the court. They even offered us a hefty amount for settlement. But we didn’t agree,” the victim’s brother was quoted by the Hindustan Times as saying.

The family also alleged they were forced to move to Rohtak district in the state from a neighbouring district after the 2013 attack because of harassment by the accused.

Members of the Dalit caste held small protests in Rohtak on Sunday to demand justice for the victim.

The fatal gang-rape of a student on a bus in Delhi in 2012 shone a global spotlight on frightening levels of violence against women in India.

It also led to major reform of India’s rape laws, including speeding up of trials and increased punishments for offenders, but horrific attacks continue to be reported in the media on a daily basis.

The most recent official figures show that 36,735 rapes were reported across the country in 2014, although activists say the true number is likely much higher because of the social stigma attached to sexual crimes.",[],"NEW DELHI: An Indian student was recovering in hospital after being gang-raped by a group of men including some charged with sexually assaulting her three years earlier, an officer said on Monday.

LAHORE - An anti-terrorism court in Lahore on Saturday sentenced two men to death over the gang rape of a French-Pakistani mother, lawyers said, an attack that prompted nationwide protests and tough new anti-rape legislation.

The ATC convicted Abid Malhi and Shafqat Ali, prime accused and co-accused, in the Motorway gang-rape case after charges were proved against them. The court handed down death sentence to both the accused under Section 376 of Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) for rape.

The court awarded life imprisonment to both accused under Section 365-A of PPC for kidnapping the victim and confiscating her property. Besides imposing Rs 200,000 fine each, the court also awarded 14 years imprisonment to both accused under Section 392 of PPC for robbery.

The court awarded five years imprisonment to both accused under Section 440 of PPC for mischief, besides imposing Rs 50,000 fine. The accused were also ordered to pay Rs 100,000 each as compensation to the victim under Section 337-F1 and 337-L2 of the PPC for causing injury to the victim.

ATC Judge Arshad Hussain Bhutta announced the verdict at Camp Jail in the presence of the accused, their counsel, Deputy Prosecutor General Hafiz Asghar and Deputy Prosecutor General Waqar Bhatti. The court had reserved the verdict on March 18 after hearing detailed arguments of parties.

‘Solid evidence’

The prosecutors argued that the accused gang-raped the victim woman at gunpoint and solid evidence was available against them. They argued that the accused were arrested after their DNA matched with the samples collected from crime scene whereas the victim woman also identified them during identification parade held in the presence of the magistrate. They also submitted that co-accused Shafqat admitted the crime before a judicial magistrate. They pleaded with the court for handing down strict punishment to the accused as they committed a heinous crime.

However, the defence counsel opposed the plea, saying that the prosecution failed to prove presence of accused Shafqat on crime scene whereas the identification parade of Shafqat Ali was held after 22 days of his arrest. They submitted the statement of accused Shafqat was recorded after a delay of one month and eighteen days whereas he was forced to get record his statement. The defence also questioned the authenticity of the identification parade while raising various questions on process adopted during it.

It is pertinent to mention here that the prosecution presented 37 witnesses, including the victim woman, during the trial.

The Gujjarpura police had filed a challan against the accused, wherein they were declared guilty. The police had requested the court for awarding strict punishment to the accused as sufficient evidence was available against them.

On September 9, the accused- Abid Malhi and Shafqat Ali, allegedly raped a woman at gunpoint in Gujjarpura area while she was waiting for help on the motorway after her car ran out of fuel.

An FIR of the incident was lodged with the Gujjarpura police under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA).

‘Anger’

The woman was attacked in September last year in front of her small children on the side of a motorway after her car ran out of fuel near the southern city of Lahore.

An outpouring of anger was further fuelled by a police chief who chided the victim for driving at night without a male companion. “They’ve both been handed the death penalty,” Chaudhry Qasim Arain, a lawyer for both men, told reporters after the verdict and sentencing hearing. The two men would appeal the decision, announced at an anti-terrorism court in Lahore.

The attack and the subsequent demands for better protection of women prompted the government to introduce new legislation, including the establishment of special courts to speed up rape trials and the chemical castration of serial rapists.

‘Chemical castration’

Chemical castration of rapists involves using drugs to reduce a person’s libido. It was backed by the country’s Prime Minister Imran Khan but activists said it was unclear how it would act as a deterrent.

Pakistan is a deeply conservative nation where victims of sexual abuse often are too afraid to speak out and criminal complaints are frequently not investigated seriously.

The country has an abysmal rape conviction rate, with official data putting it as low as 0.3 percent.

According to the rights groups Justice Project Pakistan, the number of prisoner executions has fallen in the past few years to 15 in both 2018 and 2019. Many death sentences are later commuted to life imprisonment terms.

At the time of the gang rape, Lahore police chief Umar Sheikh repeatedly berated the victim for driving at night without a man, adding that no one in Pakistani society would “allow their sisters and daughters to travel alone so late”.

Sheikh went on to say the woman -- a resident of France -- probably “mistook that Pakistani society is just as safe” as her home country. Thousands took part in protests, demanding justice and an increase in spending on initiatives that improve women’s safety, as well as an end to victim blaming.

Much of Pakistan lives under a patriarchal code of “honour” that systematises the oppression of women and those who supposedly bring “shame” on the family can be subjected to violence or murder.

The reported gang rape of a 19-year-old lower caste woman in the Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh has shaken the entire nation, and several politicians are seeking to visit the victim's family.

A man hurled ink at Delhi parliamentarian Sanjay Singh while he was addressing the media after meeting the family of an alleged gang-rape victim who is said to have been brutally assaulted by four upper caste men on 14 September.

The video of the incident has gone viral with over 45,000 views. It shows a man walking up to a group of media personnel surrounding the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and hurling ink at him.

The man, identified as Deepak Sharma, has been detained by police. He said the lawmaker's visit to Hathras was politically motivated, which made him throw ink at him.

Soon after being attacked, Singh tweeted that Uttar Pradesh State Chief Yogi Adityanath ""is not a Thakur (Upper caste community) but a coward and that he (Singh) would continue to fight for justice for the little girl"".

The four accused in the gang-rape of the Dalit (lower caste community) girl, also belong to the upper caste Thakur community.

The state chief, who has been under fire from opposition parties for his ""inefficient and insensitive"" handling of the case, has ordered a probe by India's top investigation agency Central Bureau of Investigation into the incident.

After being moved to Delhi's Safdarjung hospital for better treatment, the young woman died from her injuries on 29 September.

Lurdes Ferreira, a police spokesman in the Tete province, said police are investigating the teenager’s kidnap and murder. “We have launched a search and arrest operation for those responsible for the macabre crime,” Ferreira said.

The murder comes four months after a failed attempt by two parents to sell their albino child in Moatize. Tete, which borders Malawi, is believed to have a large market for albino organ trafficking.

ISLAMABAD : Pakistan’s first cyber harassment helpline is set to be launched on December 1, announced the Digital Rights Foundation (DRF) Monday, at their ‘Hamara Internet- Ending Online Violence Against Women’ conference in Islamabad.

Anyone facing online harassment can call in on 0800-39393 to talk in a “free, safe and confidential” environment, read an announcement made on DRF’s Facebook page.

The service aims to provide legal advice, digital security support, psychological counselling and a referral system to victims. “It will begin its operations on Dec 1, 2016,” the DRF said.

According to Nighat Dad; lawyer, internet activist and founder of the DRF, the idea to start a helpline service started with their Hamara Internet campaign. “We travelled across Pakistan and spoke to girls at universities in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan and other cities and provinces to create awareness about online harassment,” she said. There are several definitions of harassment, said the activist, adding that it was a state where you felt uncomfortable in a situation.

“The same applies for the internet if someone is stalking you, sending unsolicited messages of comments on posts – this can convert into violence, threats or blackmail,” Nighat said.

Explaining the Hamara Internet campaign, she said that the idea was to address online violence – stalking, blackmailing etc.

“We started our campaign a year ago and the objective was to address online harassment, we went into colleges and universities across the country and spoke to students about online harassment and what to do if they were stuck in such a situation, what preventive measures they could take, online safety and privacy and settings on social media; and how to file a report,” she said.

She added that the second part of the campaign focused on the legal remedy – what to do, how to file a report to the FIA’s cyber crime cell.

“When the girls learnt about these things we started getting so many calls and messages – they realised that if they couldn’t talk to family or friends about this sort of harassment they could come to us,” she said. The launch of the helpline is part of the DRF’s 16 Days of Activism on Violence Against Women.

Shmyla Khan, the DRF lawyer heading the helpline initiative, said the non-profit is collaborating with the Federal Investigation Agency, which has considerable experience in handling cases of online harassment.

Shmyla said the complainant would be guaranteed complete confidentiality.

“We will not be recording any calls and storing any data in order to safeguard the complainant’s right to privacy,” Shmyla said, adding that the caller’s safety was the initiative’s top priority.",[],"Share:ISLAMABAD : Pakistan’s first cyber harassment helpline is set to be launched on December 1, announced the Digital Rights Foundation (DRF) Monday, at their ‘Hamara Internet- Ending Online Violence Against Women’ conference in Islamabad.

Earlier this week Terry Crews testified in front of the US Senators about his sexual assault experience and was lauded by his fellow actors for standing up and bringing to light his Me Too story.

His Brooklyn Nine-Nina star Andy Samberg said he and others who appear on the show are in awe of their fellow cast member Crews after the ex-football player’s testimony

Support for the actor hasn’t been universal though, rapper 50 Cent mocked Crews’ testimony and was excoriated on social media.

Crews testified Tuesday in Washington before the Senate Judiciary Committee about being groped at a party by a powerful Hollywood agent he is now suing. Sen. Dianne Feinstein asked the actor, comedian and former athlete why he didn’t physically fight back. Crews explained that with the help of his wife, Rebecca, he has learned the benefits of non-violence in America, especially as a black man.

“We have a cast text chain and we were all texting him how incredible it was,” Samberg said Thursday of Crews’ testimony at a media appearance promoting his new film, Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation.

“He’s a miracle. Terry’s the best guy,” Samberg said. “I am proud to know him.”

Los Angeles prosecutors declined to file charges against the agent, stating the groping didn’t meet the criteria for a felony and that the February 2016 incident fell outside the statute of limitations to prosecute it as a misdemeanor.

In a now-deleted post on Instgram, 50 Cent mocked Crews’ testimony. “LOL ... Terry: I froze in fear. They would have had to take me to jail. ...”

At a Starz network event Thursday night to support Power, a series 50 Cent appears on and executive produces, the rapper told The Associated Press: “You know what? When you put LOL behind any statement, it means you’re laughing out loud. That means it’s a joke. That’s it. Sometimes journalists leave those things out.”

LAHORE - The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has expressed grave concern over sexual abuse of children in Kasur and demanded prompt investigation, prosecution and effective steps to save the children from sexual violence.

In a statement issued on Monday, the Commission said: “HRCP is horrified to learn of the child sexual abuse saga in Kasur. There might be some ambiguity as to the number of children targeted, the time when the abuse took place, and whether a property dispute was involved, although how that makes the matter any less horrific is lost on us, but it is now certain that many children had been abused and their abuse filmed.”

“Judicial commissions and inquiries rarely serve the purpose in criminal cases. The plight of these children deserves nothing less than a prompt and professional investigation – which must be free from interference and influence – and prosecution. All attempts made to suppress or twist the information – and there have been many – should be strongly condemned and must also be probed,” the commission added.

The commission further says: “One does not know how many other villages this must go on in. This horrible case again brings into focus the increasing violence against children that remains unchecked and calls for measures to save our children from sexual and all other violence.”

“This incident has also drawn attention to the fact that child pornographic video clips are being procured and disseminated and the possibility of this business motivating child abuse needs to be properly investigated.”

It should also remind the authorities to show more commitment to implementing the recommendation made to Pakistan by the Committee on the Rights of the Child on prevention of abuse and exploitation of children and also the relevant child-specific recommendations that Pakistan had accepted and agreed to implement during its second universal periodic review in 2012.

The discovery of another three bodies of children that were sexually abused in Kasur tells us that the #JusticeForZainab movement all but failed in creating discourse on the child abuse problem in Pakistan, nor did the public hanging of the perpetrator do enough in deterring future criminals from this crime. Kasur keeps making headlines for the wrong reasons, which makes us believe that this problem is restricted to one district in Punjab. But make no mistake; this is a national problem. There are cases of child abuse all over the country – Kasur’s victims are just the only ones that have surfaced.

Successive governments have failed in responding to this serious problem. The crime of sexual abuse is not related to only one aspect of the state’s failure to protect its citizens; there are a plethora of reasons for why this continues to take place. Apart from a lack of implementation of the laws of the country, a failure in policing – the inability to protect citizens, conduct investigations and find the right perpetrator for each crime committed (there are reports that Zainab’s rapist was coerced by the police into admitting involvement in other child abuse cases as well) – is one of the more obvious causes for child abuse in Pakistan.

But there are deeper issues that lie below the surface – the police can nab a thousand perpetrators and the state can hang all of them and this problem still won’t be eradicated. It is high time that this country engages in a serious discussion regarding child abuse. Whether it is the lack of a healthy, communicative relationship between parents and children, or the fact that these issues are considered too taboo to ever see the light of day – Pakistan’s society needs to zero in on the reasons due to the astronomical number of child sexual abuse cases in the country.

It probably also has to do with sexual repression – as an Islamic state, Pakistan’s values are different than its western counterparts, but this does not mean that we shut down any discussion on sexual and reproductive health. This problem is too serious to ignore, and no longer can the state and citizens of the country put off debating the issue of child molestation in the country – the perpetrators count on our society’s ability to look away whenever this is brought up through new victims surfacing. The future of our country is at stake; we cannot let these monsters take advantage of the vulnerability of children any longer, the government needs to take policy initiatives before more children are brutalised.",[],"Kasur keeps making headlines for the wrong reasons, which makes us believe that this problem is restricted to one district in Punjab.

According to a Press report Musharraf has bought a nest in Australia for his residence. What a strategy The Taliban must be extremely depressed. They have been hunting for Musharraf up and down the country for years. Sometimes they were within an ace of hooking him. But the Commando most craftily dodged them. Australia is surrounded by wide seas and is very thinly populated. Hunting for Musharraf in such an inhospitable wilderness would be almost impossible for the Taliban. Poor Taliban However, there was a more secure asylum in the world. Musharraf could have settled in the North or the South Pole. Had he flown there and had the Taliban got the news, they would have instantaneously dustbinned all their Musharraf-catching plans. And what a glorious redemption it would have been for Musharraf The Taliban would have consoled themselves by murmuring: ""Now we must wait. We would capture him on the Day of Judgement."" As a president, Musharraf carved a place for himself in history. As a settler in the Poles he would have carved a place for himself in geography. If Musharraf did fly to Australia as a settler, would his political cronies be grieved? Only the cronies know. But what would he himself feel? Let's not ask stupid questions. Washington has been hunting for Osama for years. Musharraf cooperated with the hunters. The cooperation was horrifically misused by Washington. It was meant only for Osama-hunting. Unfortunately, Washington rained bombs almost all over Afghanistan. Perhaps America believed that Osama's body was the size of Afghanistan. Thousands upon thousands of innocent Afghan men, women and children were killed. Washington smelt the carcasses and enjoyed the smell. Musharraf had to pay for the cooperation. He could no longer abide in Pakistan. For what he did for Washington, Washington ought to have offered him asylum in America. It was Washington's moral obligation. Had Musharraf declined the offer, Washington ought to have smuggled him to America as a respectable guest. But no American would not allow its political activities to be polluted by morality. When Musharraf decrowned himself, the masses were jubilant. They were extremely optimistic that things would start improving phenomenally at a phenomenal rate. Unfortunately, they were soon disappointed. Things have been worsening at the rate of a cruise missile. Actually, Pakistan is a political cockpit where our political cocks keep fighting and the masses keep biting themselves out of sheer frustration. Musharraf was about to retire. He had already given the most vigorous years of his life to his gun. He was a successful commando. One day he was flying home from abroad when mysteriously certain things blew out of the blue. He became a politician. He married presidency. It was a forced marriage and on top of it his second marriage. Obviously, he committed bigamy for which he was condignly punished. Unfortunately, his performance as a political commando extremely disappointed the masses. They forced him to divorce his second mate. Our politics is the mother of all our woes and ordeals. Our salvation kies in divorcing the mother. Not only in Pakistan, in most of the countries of the world the misery of the masses is a gift of the politicians. But is there an alternative to the politicians. Plato comes to our rescue. He declares that unless philosophers become rulers and those who are ruling become philosophers, there can be respite for mankind. Thus only philosophers as rulers can transmute our political hell into a blissful paradise. The havoc which our past rulers inflicted upon the masses was the consequence of the sad fact that they were not philosophers. Had they been philosophers and been succeeded by philosophers, Pakistan would have become the envy of the world. Anyway forget about our political past. But we can ask all the candidates who are currently running for the presidency to prove that they are genuine philosophers and not commercial politicians. Plato is confident that even when a philosopher is forced to be ruler, he would do for the country what no commercial politician would do. Since, according to Plato a non-philosopher cannot be a beneficent ruler, Musharraf is lucky that he was not born in Plato's age. Obviously, Plato is a conspirator against the professional politicians. The politicians must ensure that Plato is expunged from all the textbooks of philosophy being used in colleges and universities. Unfortunately, politicians inflict themselves as rulers upon the masses through the ballot-box. So far, in Pakistan the ballot-box has turned out to be a Pandora's box for the masses.

The woman whose sexual assault allegation threatens to bring down Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee rejected an ultimatum Friday for testifying in the Senate after the US president turned against her, claiming her accusation could not be true.

The increasingly ugly fight over the fate of Trump's bid to put conservative judge Brett Kavanaugh into the lifetime position on the Supreme Court appeared to be nearing its end game, though still with no clarity on whether the woman at the center of the row will testify.

Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor who says Kavanaugh carried out a violent sexual assault against her when he was 17 and she was 15, insists she is ready to testify under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

However, she rejected a deadline of late Friday imposed by the committee's Republican leader to agree to his terms for the hearing, which he said should take place next Wednesday.

If she didn't agree, committee chairman Charles Grassley said, he would go ahead and schedule a vote on confirming Kavanaugh on Monday, but without her testimony.

A statement by Ford's lawyers carried by CNN asked for one more day to respond, calling the deadline ""arbitrary.""

""Its sole purpose is to bully Dr. Ford and deprive her of the ability to make a considered decision.... Our modest request is that she be given an additional day to make her decision.""

Ford has said she wants to testify Thursday at the earliest and to be able to call as a witness a man who she says was present during the assault, when they were all teenagers attending private schools near Washington, DC.

The committee's Republican leadership has turned down those demands. But there was no immediate response from the Republicans to Ford's latest message asking for extra time.

Presidential pressure

After several days of maintaining a relatively neutral posture, Trump took off the gloves Friday to declare that Ford could not be believed.

The aggressive posture reflected Trump's fear that time is running out to get his hand-picked judge confirmed -- thereby tilting the Supreme Court firmly to the right for years to come -- before November elections when Republicans risk losing control of Congress.

""TAKE THE VOTE!"" Trump tweeted, blaming ""radical left wing politicians"" for the controversy.

Trump rejected the credibility of Ford's claim that a drunken Kavanaugh tried to pin her down and remove her clothes, muffling her cries, in the early 1980s.

According to Trump, the fact that Ford remained silent until now shows the incident probably never happened -- even if this runs counter to what experts say is the typical reaction of sexual assault victims afraid or embarrassed to report.

""I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr Ford was as bad as she says,"" Trump wrote, ""charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents.""

""Why didn't someone call the FBI 36 years ago?""

The senior Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, called Trump's logic ""a highly offensive misunderstanding of surviving trauma.""

More concerning for Trump might have been the angry reaction of one of his own Republican senators, Susan Collins, who sits on the Judiciary Committee.

""I was appalled by the president's tweet,"" she told US media.

""We know that allegations of sexual assault are some of the most under-reported crimes that exist. So I thought that the president's tweet was completely inappropriate and wrong.""

Trump's outburst saw a new #MeToo era hashtag storm the internet, with #WhyIDidntReport the top trending conversation starter on US Twitter, as people -- mostly women -- vented outrage over past transgressions and voiced solidarity with Ford.

High stakes

Republicans are frustrated over what they say was the deliberate timing of the last-minute revelation of Ford's allegation, accusing Democrats of seeking to prevent the process from finishing before the November midterm elections.

Democrats hope to recapture at least one chamber of Congress in the vote.

For their part, Democrats say Republicans are mounting an unseemly rush to get Kavanaugh into the nine-member Supreme Court while they still control the legislature.

Kavanaugh has repeatedly agreed to testify before the Republican-led Senate Judiciary Committee, saying he wants to clear his name.

A distinguished judge seen as favoring conservative interpretations of the constitution, he has not been accused in other sexual misconduct related cases and no further witness has come forward to corroborate Ford's claims.

While Kavanaugh has seen his near coronation transformed into a fight for his basic reputation, Ford has found herself thrown into the harsh light of an all-out Washington political fight.

ATHENS - Masked youths on Wednesday threw stones and vandalised property in Athens during annual protests in remembrance of a teenage boy killed by police in 2008. The small groups of youths also tore down street signs, toppled garbage bins and set fire to debris.

Riot police were on the scene but generally did not interfere. School pupils, university students and left-wing organisations are holding protests in Greece's main cities in memory of 15-year-old Alexis Grigoropoulos, who was fatally shot by a police officer in 2008. At the time, Grigoropoulos' death sparked days of youth unrest around Greece.

Greek police are already on alert over a two-day visit by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan starting on Thursday. The officer who shot Grigoropoulos following a street row, Epaminondas Korkoneas, was in 2010 found guilty of culpable homicide and sentenced to life in prison for the killing. At his trial, Korkoneas claimed he had fired warning shots to keep back youngsters who were hurling objects at him and his patrol partner.

One of his bullets deflected onto the boy's chest, killing him before he could be taken to hospital. His patrol partner Vassilios Saraliotis was sentenced to 10 years for complicity but was conditionally freed in 2011.",[],"Share:ATHENS - Masked youths on Wednesday threw stones and vandalised property in Athens during annual protests in remembrance of a teenage boy killed by police in 2008.

When people have accepted the subservience of women performing in mujra parties and receiving all kinds of harassment, their hypocrisy majorly remains subliminal when they themselves abhor their female family members doing the same. They would dance at the whims of men. They would even be raped by men. And then they would be demonized for that. Their acceptable role has been nothing short of a misogynist mindset. And in this patriarchal setup, men feel threatened by free spirited women. They cannot conceive the idea that women have a right to enjoy her independence, self reliance and free will. Where they take charge of woman’s body, be it their own wives, or sex workers, many Fauzia Azeems have always defied all that and never allowed anyone to control her. I mean no offence, but if we recall, actress Veena Malik also had to face the malicious campaign against her for the liberties she took. But she was in our neighboring country where she could afford all that. However, it was only her “forgiveness’ and “repentance” that allowed her to be in her country again and regain her “respect”.

This is what Qandeel Baloch never accepted to conform herself to the acceptability of the people here. She did what she wanted to for herself. She was the one who took charge of her of her own body, and never allowed anyone to exploit it. Whether people condone her antics or not, but she had the way of bringing out the dark and sickening side of the society; something that irked the moral contractors here. She had earlier complained about threats she’s been receiving as a price to live in Pakistan. But she was never taken seriously. People ridiculed her by saying that she deserved receiving hate messages and death threats. She had faced all kinds of cyberbullying and harassment, but she ignored them. All this is not only about Qandeel Baloch. Indeed it is about the freedom for the women to chose what they want for themselves. While some people have - and still do - condemned her for her bold performances on social media, she was still resilient. No fear for life could stop her, which is something only someone as gutsy as she could do. You may not have to agree to everything she’s said or done, but you cannot deny the strong impression she left behind. It was as if it was her revenge against the society for how it treated her.

Born in 1990, this young woman belonged to a middle class family. Being married off at a tender age of 17, she claimed that she was subjected to abuse by her husband. She had a son from this marriage, she got separated from him 7 years ago at the time of her divorce. She lamented in one of her interviews that her son doesn’t even know who his mother was.

But she didn’t bow down or feel let down by people. Her revenge against the hypocritical society was by becoming their ultimate troll. As she rose to her popularity—rather notoriety, she became everybody’s subject to talk about. She also had some admirers who respected her individuality, rather than seeing her as a male propriety i.e as a wife, a mother, a sister. She revolted against patriarchal notion of laying sole responsibility on a woman for honor, and it is the very “hurt honor’ that made her brother murder her in cold blood as well. People who say “there is no honor in killing women’ themselves need to see that honor has indeed been an integral part of our culture. Whenever we try to insult another person, we retort to the cuss words that implies disrespect of their female family members. Pick up a dictionary of cuss words, you will find that they are always women-centric. ‘teri maan ki yeh, teri behn ki woh...' (your mother this—your sister that). That’s not the case of one language, the derogatory words used in other languages center on abusing vulgarities against male by bringing in his female members. It is also noteworthy that there are almost no cuss words that are male-centric, the closest male-centric insult to men would be a comment on his impotency or calling them eunuchs. Honor is never an individual enterprise in Pakistan, and where it is, people punish themselves instead of others for bringing dishonor, like in Japan.

It is argued that the concept of honor has nothing to do with Islam, which is true as Islam has given the right to the women to chose for themselves in matters of marriage. However, religion has been mixed with tribal traditions where it re-endorses “male honor”. Even if people don’t go to the extremes to killing women for violation of their preconceived moral codes, but the concept of honor is universally the same here. Women get disowned or ostracized for the “shame” they’ve brought upon them.

When people criticize the twisted definition of honor here, they get labeled viciously as propagating “vulgarity”, or working on “western agenda” to destroy their traditional family values. There have been many a talk about the Qisas and Diyat laws that allows for the family to forgive the assailant. The laws are genuinely criticized because it is usually the same family that forgives their family members committed honor-killings. Because of faulty laws, Pakistan witnesses men feeling proud of killing their “disgraced” family members. In fact, the laws enable the perpetrators to carry out these murders without any repercussion. This is our tragedy, no matter how many times the issue has been raised in the media and condemned, the crimes of honor can never be prevented for as long as the laws of reconciliation and blood money is there. Last year, about 1,100 women had lost their lives because somebody’s honor got hurt by their making choices without their “approval”, and the numbers keeps on growing every year.

What happened to Qandeel Baloch is not an extraordinary story of honor killing. Strangled by her brother and involvement of family is not surprising for us. But what Qandeel Baloch did was iconic, and will always be remembered as such. People have loved and hated her for what she did or said, but she managed to expose the inherent hypocrisy in people. One such recent controversy was with Maulana Qavi, a member of the Ruet-e-Hilal Committee from which he was expelled when Qandeel Baloch released her photos with this cleric. The grudge Maulana Qavi had against her has surfaced where he warned that others who ridicule clerics should will meet the same fate as that of Qaneel Baloch.

People will hardly understand who Qandeel Baloch really was. Though she used the same objectification of her body that the male centric societies do, but she used it as a way to expose the mockery of the chauvinists. Many of us may not take her as a role model, but at least we should see her as a woman who rebelled and defied all moral dictates. The conservatives are commending her death. They are justifying her murder. This is the crux of misogyny when people say “she deserved it”. No, there is no justification of murder. A murder is murder, no matter how one glorifies it.

“I believe I am a modern age feminist. I believe in equality. I need not to choose what type of woman I should be. I don’t think there is any need to label ourselves just for the sake of the society. I am just a woman with free thoughts, free mindset and I love the way I am” - Qandeel Baloch

Lahore - Lahore High Court Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Shamim Khan said that violence against women is a grave violation of human rights.

The chief justice was addressing the opening ceremony of a three-day workshop on gender-based violence cases held at Punjab Judicial Academy on Thursday. The workshop was held in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank and the Law & Justice Commission of Pakistan.

Addressing the participants, the chief justice said, “Violence against women is a grave violation of human rights. Occurring in public and private places, it has many forms, ranging from domestic violence to harassment at work place, assault, sexual violence and gender-related killing. Its impact spans from immediate to long-term multiple physical, sexual and mental consequences for women and girls, including death.”

He further said that it negatively affects women’s general well-being and prevents women from fully participating in society. Violence not only has negative consequences for women but also for their families, the community and country, he maintained.

He said, “In our country, the social protection of women is enshrined in Article 25 and 34 of the Constitution and affirmed in the country’s status as a signatory of various regional and international treaties seeking to protect women’s rights and promote gender equality. Moreover, the State has taken progressive steps to legislate on various issues pertaining to women and their rights such as reviving family laws like a woman’s right to divorce, marry, vote, and work. We have several laws and policies against various forms of violence.”

He added that challenges remained however in implementing these measures the question was how to eliminate it. Gender-based violence is an extremely complex phenomenon, deeply rooted in gender-based power relations, sexuality, self-identity, and social institutions. Any strategy to eliminate gender violence must therefore confront the underlying cultural beliefs and social structures that perpetuate it, he said. To be effective, such a strategy would have to draw on a wide range of expertise and resources, both governmental and non-governmental, he said.

“A strategy to prevent violence must also promote nonviolent means to resolve conflict. Passing laws to criminalise violence within family relationships—in the same way that societies criminalize violence between strangers—is an important way to redefine the frontiers of acceptable behavior. Passing or amending laws on paper is not enough to ensure change, but their strict implementation can be a considerable asset in helping women to protect themselves from violence,” he said.

Strengthening his viewpoint, he also quoted Islam, saying “Islamic teachings also effectively answer this issue. Islam generally improved the status of women. At a time when female children were buried alive in Arabia and women were considered transferable property, Islam honours women in society by elevating them and protecting them with unprecedented rights. Islam gave women the right to education, to marry someone of their choice, to retain their identity after marriage, to divorce, to work, to own and sell property, to inherit, Lo seek protection of the law, to vote, and to participate in civic and political engagement.

Any form of emotional, physical, or psychological abuse is prohibited in Islam and the improper treatment of women is no Exception to this rule. Indeed, there is no teaching in Islam, when studied in its complete context. which condones any kind of domestic violence. Islam clearly disallows any form of oppression or abuse in this regard.”

Essential reforms are needed in the social, economic, and judicial sectors to foster the creation of a socio-cultural and economic environment that is conducive to a woman’s safety and autonomy, he said. There must be a fundamental change in societal attitudes, and particularly in men’s perception of women’s status, he stressed.",['Shahzad Ahmad'],"Share:Lahore - Lahore High Court Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Shamim Khan said that violence against women is a grave violation of human rights.

Haroon Janjua

Islamabad - The recent burning of a teenage girl by her own mother in the name of honour has triggered the debate on so-called honour killings in the country.

Last week in the country’s eastern city of Lahore, an 18-year-old Zeenat Rafiq was drenched with kerosene oil and set on fire because the girl had challenged the social norms by marrying a man of her own choice.

The case stirred the countrywide anger among the civil society and human rights activists but such killings are common in Pakistan.

Lahore’s Zeenat Rafiq is the most recent case in the series of such occurrences in recent months. However, recently, in the hilly town of Murree a 21-year-old schoolteacher Maria Bibi was set ablaze for refusing to marry a man twice of her age. Later, she succumbed to her injuries at PIMS, Islamabad, on May 31.

Earlier in May, a 16-year-old girl Ambreen was strangled and set on fire in Abbottabad, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, after the decision given by the local jirga.

Jirgas and customary laws run parallel with the democratic constitution of the country in resolving local disputes. Ambreen was punished for helping her school friend to elope with her lover.

In Pakistan, the victims have been killed by relatives for getting raped, being homosexual, committing adultery and actions that bring shame or dishonour to the family.

“There has been an increase in the honour killing cases in various parts of the country. Media and police records show the sudden rise in such crimes, which is a discouraging element for the society,” says Tahira Abdullah, human rights activist.

Simultaneously, she told The Nation that Pakistan is becoming highly polarised society with moderate powers giving ground and fundamentalist radical forces having a broader say in determining the country’s laws and politics.

Various critics view that the bill against honour killings was passed in 2004 but it has hitherto been badly followed.

Moreover, human rights activists view that even with the sounder implementation, the law itself is not adequate enough to preclude such practices. “Legislation cannot do practically enough until there is a positive change and development in social positioning of the women,” Dr Farzana Bari, an Islamabad-based women rights activist told The Nation.

However, there is an urgent requirement for fortifying the current law against honour killings, Bari stressed, indicating that at present most the such cases are not been followed up in court. This resulted in the rise of such crimes being committed with impunity, she believes.

Samar Minullah, a social activist and filmmaker suggested, “The state has to become defender of victims of honour killings and ensure rigorous punishment for the culprits.”

Minullah also blamed the country’s mainstream media of partially strengthening anti-women social approaches by portraying women as subservient entities in television transmissions and serials. However, she also criticised the media in reporting such incidents, saying: “Media to a greater extent recklessly glorifies the killers in such cases.”

However, the situation ignites when the Pakistan’s top clerical body, Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), has taken controversial stances in recent months, saying that a husband should be allowed to “lightly beat” his wife, besides declaring a women’s protection legislation “un-Islamic.”

Rights activists asked if the CII or any other religious body, whatsoever, has ever come forward and condemned crimes committed against women in this country.

Activists accept that it is not easy to change societal behaviour towards women in Pakistan. They are committed with the cause and vow to carry on their efforts to eradicate such anti-women practices from the society.

The HRCP complainant cell head, Zaman Khan denounced the government on the issue. The government has not appointed a chairperson for the National Commission on Status of Women for the past six months – one of the major governmental bodies regarding women rights.

In February, when filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy won the Oscar ward on her short documentary “A girl in the river,” various activists and campaigners in Pakistan took heart from the Sharmeen’s award which pressed for the stronger legislations to protect potential victims. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is committed to bring forth the stronger legislation on honour killing and give women their due rights for achieving the shared goal of prosperous and vibrant Pakistan.",[],"Share:Haroon JanjuaIslamabad - The recent burning of a teenage girl by her own mother in the name of honour has triggered the debate on so-called honour killings in the country.

KARACHI - Mahira Khan has made an appeal to teachers and parents to give children proper education to protect themselves from sexual abuse.

The actor took part in a press conference today at Karachi Press Club along with Shehzad Roy, Zeba Bakhtiar and Younis Khan to talk on the tragic case of Farishta, a ten-year-old girl who was kidnapped, raped and murdered.

“This is a tragic event, but such terrible incidents are happening all over our country. Children are suffering such incidents and we need to do what we can to prevent this,” said Mahira, going on to talk about the importance of educating children against inappropriate touch.

“We aren’t taught as children what is an inappropriate touch. Parents and teachers should teach their children about these things. Awareness of good touch and bad touch should begin at home and awareness about sexual abuse should be taught at home and school.”

Younis Khan emphasised the importance of having a conversation about these matters with children, as it will make them not only aware but will also allow them to speak up should they be uncomfortable in a setting.

“Please, when these things are not talked about in your homes, don’t hush your children up because you can’t even think what those children must be experiencing at the time,” said the actor.

She added: “This is something to give importance to. Whether it’s the police, the child protection unit or counselors, they should be involved in helping children be aware... We need child psychologists and therapists in our child protection units to help them.”

“This is the outcry we had a year ago when Zainab’s murder happened and now this incident has shaken us yet again,” said Shehzad Roy. “Why is sexual education not being properly taught after everything that has happened? Why isn’t our child protection unit working on making this happen?”

He added, “We need to understand that when such incidents happen, they start slowly. It starts with an inappropriate touch that a child doesn’t understand and is quiet about and it grows to the point that a life is lost. We don’t want it to get to that point, it can be stopped in the first go if a child knows what a bad touch is.”

According to Zeba Bakhtiar, “We all need to work together to make this change in our society happen. Education for children regarding all this is very important. Social media plays an important part in all this.”",['Our Staff Report'],"Share:KARACHI - Mahira Khan has made an appeal to teachers and parents to give children proper education to protect themselves from sexual abuse.

Helsinki (AFP) - Finnish police reported Thursday an unusually high level of sexual harassment in Helsinki on New Year's Eve and said they had been tipped off about plans by groups of asylum seekers to sexually harass women.

Helsinki deputy police chief Ilkka Koskimaki told AFP: ""There hasn't been this kind of harassment on previous New Year's Eves or other occasions for that matter... This is a completely new phenomenon in Helsinki.""

Security guards hired to patrol the city on New Year's Eve told police there had been ""widespread sexual harassment"" at a central square where around 20,000 people had gathered for celebrations.

Three sexual assaults allegedly took place at Helsinki's central railway station on New Year's Eve, where around 1,000 mostly Iraqi asylum seekers had converged.

""Police have... received information about three cases of sexual assault, of which two have been filed as complaints,"" Helsinki police said in a statement.

""The suspects were asylum seekers. The three were caught and taken into custody on the spot,"" Koskimaki told AFP.

Police said they had increased their preparedness ""to an exceptional level"" in Helsinki for New Year's Eve after being tipped off about possible problems.

""Ahead of New Year's Eve, the police caught wind of information that asylum seekers in the capital region possibly had similar plans to what the men gathered in Cologne's railway station have been reported to have had,"" police said in a statement.

Dozens of apparently coordinated sexual assaults against women took place on New Year's Eve in the western German city of Cologne.

Cologne police said they had received 120 criminal complaints by Thursday and quoted witnesses as saying that groups of 20-30 young men ""who appeared to be of Arab origin"" had surrounded victims, assaulted them and in several cases robbed them.

Koskimaki said police did not see a link between the Cologne and Helsinki incidents.

Shortly before New Year's Eve, Finnish police also arrested six Iraqis at an asylum residency centre in Kirkkonummi, around 30 kilometres (19 miles) west of Helsinki, suspected of ""publicly inciting criminal behaviour"". They were released on January 2.

According to Koskimaki, the arrests were linked to the information police received in the run-up to New Year's Eve.

In November, Finnish authorities said around 10 asylum seekers were suspected of rapes, among the more than 1,000 rapes reported to police in 2015.",[],"Helsinki deputy police chief Ilkka Koskimaki told AFP: ""There hasn't been this kind of harassment on previous New Year's Eves or other occasions for that matter...

https://nation.com.pk/30-Nov-2016/un-representing-domestic-violence,2016-11-29 22:53:32+05:00,(UN)representing Domestic Violence,"Share:

Recently UN Women launched its #BeatMe campaign to coincide with the Global 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Based Violence which run from 25 November to 10 December. The Campaign appears to be centered on a video, launched on social media, that features prominent women who have excelled in diverse fields inviting men to beat them at what they are good at. For example, the video contains a shot of Samina Baig, the only Pakistani woman and the third Pakistani to climb the Mount Everest, inviting men to beat her to the top of the mountains. Like most campaigns launched on social media the video has received mixed reviews regarding its message.

Highlighting stories of prominent women in Pakistan who have shattered gender stereotypes by excelling in male dominated fields has great symbolic value in reforming public consciousness. Firstly, it challenges the predominant narrative wherein women are primarily portrayed as weak and victims. It also provides role models for girls who live day in and day out internalising patriarchal notions that women’s place is in the home. While more and more women are entering higher education, there is still a dearth of female leaders in the public sphere. This leads to the aspirations of young women being restricted to the limited roles they see their mothers occupying.

However, beyond commemorating the achievements of a group of women, the video falls short of acting as an effective advocacy tool against domestic violence. The video by inviting men to ‘beat’ women at what they are good at the video seems to be based on the assumption that women are capable of excelling in all fields and are not inferior to men and therefore should not be beaten. This is clearly a problematic line of thought. A person’s beatability is and should not be predicated on the worth of ones skills. Domestic Violence is a malaise that transcends beyond ability, class, ethnicity and religion. Research has not demonstrated any link between relative education/professional success of women and/or men and a decrease in the rate of domestic violence. A doctor husband is just as likely to abuse his professor wife as a farmer husband is to abuse his seamstress wife. There is a tendency in Pakistan to demonise the lower socio-economic classes as the “other”- who staggers home drunk at late hours of the night and beats up his wife at the slightest provocation. This allows the elite to categorise Domestic Violence as a problem of lack of education, unemployment and lack of options to victims and simply one that does not effect it. However, women from lower socio-economic classes simply have their lives on display due to the physical proximity of their neighbours and their mobility to earn money. Women from higher socio-economic classes have more social capital to protect and therefore bear the violence silently.

To make the connection between capabilities and beatability is also problematic as the reverse side of the argument would be that were women not capable it would be acceptable to beat them. Making women prove their worth in order to escape domestic violence is simply an off shoot of patriarchy where men do not have to do the same. On a simplistic level, Domestic Violence is a manifestation of the hierarchical and dualistic gender binary that constitutes as patriarchy. There are two distinct genders- Male and Female. One is superior and one is inferior, one is strong and the other is weak. These two genders also determine the distribution of power in relationships in a way that one must necessarily have more power than the other. Socio-cultural norms that uphold patriarchy legitimise violence as a means to reinforce the heirachical relationship between men and women. Daring men to beat women simply reinforces the dualistic nature and hierarchy between the genders. A campaign effectively addressing domestic violence needs to firstly challenge the gender binary that maintains it. Why must we fall in either one of these two categories and why are they mutually exclusive? Why does one have more power than the other?

Another more obvious problem with the video is its reliance on English – a language that is not understood by majority of Pakistan’s population. Even those who understand it relate to it in a way that they can respond to advocacy messages. So the question is – who really is the intended audience of the video? Social media has been described as an echo chamber and an alternative reality. It is fortunately or unfortunately not a reality that applies to the majority. So a video that was clearly intended to focus on a social media audience will have limited reach and therefore effectiveness as an advocacy message for an issue that impacts a sizable proportion of the population. If the video was intended to show the rest of the world that Pakistani women have achievements then one needs to question how effectively funding is being utilised.

Pakistan has one of the strongest women’s movements in the world. Starting from the 80’s the women’s rights movement has demonstrated unity and coordination and is a force to be reckoned with politically and socially. UN woman should make an active attempt to utilize this network’s experience and nuanced perspectives on the state of women in Pakistan and in fact posit it at the forefront of all its advocacy.",['Zainab Zeeshan Malik'],"However, beyond commemorating the achievements of a group of women, the video falls short of acting as an effective advocacy tool against domestic violence.

Actress Alyssa Milano has sparked a huge outpouring with a simple Twitter request that women and survivors respond ""me too"" if they have been sexually assaulted or harassed.

More than 37,000 people replied to Milano, making ""#MeToo"" the top trending topic through the day Sunday, going on to Monday in Pakistan.

The avalanche of painful personal stories comes amid a series of high-profile sex abuse scandals ─ the latest centred around powerful Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.

The intensity and breadth of the response underscored how the problem extends well beyond the rich and famous, affecting the everyday lives of women around the world.

""If you've been sexually harassed or assaulted write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet,"" Milano wrote.

In France, a similar campaign with the top-trending hashtag #balancetonporc (""Expose the pig"") saw women share their experiences of being sexually harassed at work or in the street.

It was started by Sandra Muller, a journalist who began the hashtag by recounting how her former boss had called her ""my type of woman"" and then commented on her breasts.

Many women in the US and France appeared to be speaking out for the first time about abuses they had suffered, often saying they had to overcome feelings of shame and embarrassment to do so.

Broken trust

Some women using the #metoo hashtag said they had been abused as children by relatives, or as a teenager by a person they trusted. That nobody believed them when they spoke about it emerged as a common refrain.

""In public places, professional settings, the ride home. And still luckier than most,"" a woman named Shmyla wrote.

""Molested by a family member. Raped as a kid and an adult. Became a drug addict and then overcame. Don't ever give up. I'm here#MeToo,"" Amy Christensen said in her post.

""Sexual assaulted by a military doctor at Lackland AFB. 1973, ""said DebiDay, referring to a US Air Force base in Texas.

""If this doesn't make men realize the sheer scale of what women around them go through everyday, Idon't know what will. #MeToo,"" Zoya Rehman tweeted.

""If you are not at the point where you can share your #MeToo I stand with you,"" Kelly Douglas wrote.

""Your story is valid whether you share it or not."" There were many sympathetic responses from men.

Vinay Ramesh encouraged “all my fellow men to learn about #MeToo. The responsibility to stop sexual violence is absolutely on us.” “I feel disgusted and sad,” Ed Krassenstein wrote.

Scandals

Although the overwhelming majority of the posts were personal in nature, the Weinstein scandal and US President Donald Trump's videotaped boasts of groping women with impunity also drew comments.

“Just as I did after the #Trump tapes, I'm having flashbacks due to the Harvey Weinstein assault & rape allegations. Abuse is forever,” BuffieHippie wrote.

More than 20 women ─ a who's who of Hollywood ─have come forward to accuse Weinstein of rape, assault and sexual harassment.

Milano, probably best known for her role in the 1980s sitcom ""Who's the Boss"" and ""Charmed"" from the 90s, is not among the accusers.

Weinstein, who insists any sexual encounters were consensual, was expelled this week from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

A court document made public on Sunday revealed that Trump's campaign has been subpoenaed for all documents related to assault allegations that emerged during his run for the presidency.

The subpoena is part of a defamation lawsuit brought by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Trump's reality TV show “The Apprentice” who alleged he tried to kiss and grope her without her consent.",[],"Share:Actress Alyssa Milano has sparked a huge outpouring with a simple Twitter request that women and survivors respond ""me too"" if they have been sexually assaulted or harassed.

https://nation.com.pk/05-Jun-2017/bill-cosby-goes-on-trial-for-sexual-assault,2017-06-05 23:45:29+05:00,Bill Cosby goes on trial for sexual assault,"Share:

Disgraced US megastar Bill Cosby went on trial for sexual assault in Pennsylvania on Monday, accused of drugging and sexually assaulting a university employee at his Philadelphia mansion 13 years ago.

The 79-year-old actor and comedian who for decades was feted by millions as ""America's Dad"" -- and risks spending the rest of his days behind bars if convicted -- sat silently as the prosecution painted a picture of him as a sexual predator.

In what is one of America's biggest celebrity trials in years, he faces three counts of aggravated indecent assault, which each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail and a $25,000 fine.

Around 60 women have publicly accused the pioneering black comedian of being a serial sexual predator for decades, shredding his reputation, ending his career and leaving him isolated by friends and celebrities.

But the trial concerns the allegations of one woman, Andrea Constand, over one incident in January 2004. It is the only criminal case against Cosby as the vast majority of alleged abuse happened too long ago to prosecute.

Constand, a 44-year-old Canadian, was at the time director of basketball operations at Temple University, where Cosby served on the Board of Trustees until his resignation in a blaze of scandal in 2014.

In a 45-minute opening statement, the prosecution said the star of the hit television series ""The Cosby Show"" exploited his power and celebrity to abuse the trust of a woman who considered him a friend and mentor.

'Paralyzed'

Constand alleges Cosby plied her with pills and wine before sexually assaulting her on his couch after she had gone to his house to seek career advice on moving to Canada and studying massage therapy.

""As she went in and out of consciousness, she witnessed her body being used to sexually gratify the defendant,"" Montgomery County assistant district attorney Kristen Feden said. ""Because she was in that incapacitated state, she couldn't consent.""

""Completely paralyzed, frozen, lifeless,"" the prosecutor said of Constand.

Feden said the evidence would ""shatter"" illusions that Cosby was the real-life embodiment of his signature character, lovable obstetrician and benevolent father Cliff Huxtable, a role that smashed through racial barriers.

Cosby, who says he is now legally blind, arrived at the courthouse in the Philadelphia suburb of Norristown accompanied by Keshia Knight Pulliam, who played his daughter Rudy on the 1984-1992 sitcom.

His wife of 53 years, Camille, who has stood by him, has attended none of his pre-trial hearings, and the majority of his celebrity friends have deserted the award-winning star.

Cosby says he gave Constand Benadryl to relieve stress, insists their sexual relations were consensual and accuses her of lying.

The defense used its opening statement to lecture the jury on the high burden of proof in a criminal case and warned them not to get distracted by his fame or by ""finger-pointing"" from the prosecution.

""The false accusation of sexual assault -- it's an attack on human dignity, it's an attack on human innocence. It's not a distraction, it can destroy a man,"" said defense lawyer Brian McMonagle.

'Just a citizen'

McMonagle urged the jury to see Cosby as ""just a citizen,"" saying his infidelity as a husband had made him ""vulnerable to accusations"" and that while he had achieved greatness, he had also endured tragedy.

Constand, who is gay, waited a year to report the incident and initially settled the case with a civil suit in 2006.

The case was re-opened in 2015 when Montgomery County claimed new evidence had come to light.

But securing a conviction or an acquittal will be fraught with difficulties -- and it ultimately comes down to her word against his.

The prosecution will put Constand on the stand and seek to prove a pattern of behavior in also calling a former personal assistant to Cosby's agent, who alleges that he assaulted her in a similar manner in 1996.

They also intend to bring a toxicologist to testify about the effects of the pill and make use of Cosby's words in a 2005 court deposition, in which he admitted obtaining sedatives with a view to having sex.

The defense on Monday tore into Constand's credibility in its opening statement, alleging that she was untruthful ""time and time again"" and painted their relationship as consensual, one that involved many meetings and alcohol, and alleged that Constand telephoned the star 53 times.

The jury, selected 300 miles (480 kilometers) away in Pittsburgh, will be sequestered for the duration of the trial in a hotel.

ISLAMABAD-Ministry of Human Rights on Friday held awareness session on child rights and prevention of child abuse in Sabzi Mandi, I-11, Islamabad for three child protection committees.

A statement released by the ministry said that to continue Minister of Human Rights Dr. Shireen Mazari’s mission to raise awareness of public about the rights of children and prevention from child abuse, the Ministry of Human Rights through its Human Rights Awareness Programme engaged three more child protection committees from Sabzi Mandi area, Meher Abadi and I-9 to inform them about the rights of children, and ways in which children can be protected from child abuse through community based measures.

The session was conducted at the Office of the Chairman, Market Committee, Sabzi Mandi I-11 Islamabad where the audience of 45 participants comprised of parents, civil society representatives, community leaders and media.

Director General (IC), Ministry of Human Rights, Hassan Ali Mangi shared his views on child rights saying that the society must follow the guidelines of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and treat its children with love and care.

He further said that it is the duty of parents, society and the government to provide a safe space for the growth of children. He further encouraged community representatives to hold dialogue with children about child abuse.

Adding to that he said that MoHR is committed to protect the rights of every child in Pakistan and the role of parents and teachers in sensitising them and raising awareness on self-protection. Discussion was based around the rights of children in the constitution of Pakistan, protection of child rights, role of MoHR and its pledge to protect the rights of every child in Pakistan.

Participants were enlightened to encourage children to speak out whenever they feel uncomfortable with anyone whether it’s the peer, family or someone at school. The members were also informed about newly passed bill of domestic labour under Schedule 1 of the Employment of Children Act 1991, in an effort to strengthen legislation pertaining to the issue as child domestic labour causes children physical, psychological, moral and social harm. The participants were encouraged to report cases on any kind of Child Abuse on the Ministry’s helpline 1099 which is easily accessible to everyone.

MULTAN: Popular social media celebrity Qandeel Baloch has been killed in Multan, becoming the latest victim of ""honor killings"" that plague the country.

According to Waqt News the initial post mortem report shows Qandeel Baloch was strangled to death, it is suspected she was given some intoxicant before being killed as there were no signs of a struggle. Reportedly a hand was placed on her mouth during strangulation. Her viscera have been are collected and will been sent to Lahore Forensic laboratory. Qandeel Baloch’s brother has not been arrested yet, while FIR has been lodged in Muzaffargarh Thana by her father, nominating her brother as the murderer.

Qandeel, who is popular for posting bold videos and statements on Facebook, was killed by her brother. The deceased father has nominated his two sons as main suspects in murder case of his daughter. As per report Aslam allegedly provoked Waseem to kill Qandeel on honor.

Shortly, Qandeel Baloch had been spending days with her parents after she returned home for Eid, was asleep at her parent’s home in Green Town in Multan, when her brother, identified as Waseem entered the house and smothered her to death before fleeing, police said. Qandeel's brother had been threatening her over her Facebook posts and videos, said the police.

The deceased father in his initial statement informed the police that he was sleeping on roof along with his wife and son Wasim while Qandeel was sleeping in her room. At 3:00 am Wasim came down from roof and assassinated Qandeel and manage to escape from the crime scene, the deceased father added.

He however included the name Aslam Shaheen as co-accused. Her father told the police that video clips may have enraged his son and he killed her. He said that she was tearing their honor into pieces in TV programs.

Police on Saturday registered a First Information Report (FIR) against two Wasim and Aslam Shaheen, real brother of deceased Qandeel on the complaint of deceased father Muhammad Azeem. Police registered the case under Sections 302 and 109 of the Pakistan Penal Code which deal with ""punishment for willful murder"".

The police have started to conduct the raids to arrest the accused.

Senior police officer Sultan Azam said that the suspect had fled the city after committing the crime.

The brother fled after killing Qandeel, whose real name is Fauzia Azeem. Police added that Qandeel was in Multan for one week, and that forensic experts are examining the corpse to prepare a medical report.

Earlier, TV channels reported that Qandeel was shot by her brother. Police are now stating that she was ""strangled to death"" at her Multan residence.

Baloch, who became famous through her tireless self-promotion and suggestive ""selfies"" posted on social media, had amassed tens of thousands of followers. ""Nothing is good in this society. This patriarchal society is bad,"" Qandeel had said in a recent interview with Images.

Three weeks ago, Qandeel had written to the interior minister, the director general of the Federal Investigation Authority (FIA) and the senior superintendent of Islamabad asking them to provide security to her. She had also requested action against those who made her identification documents public via social media.

She had said her life is in danger and that she is being threatened via calls on her mobile number and that she did not have security measures installed in her home. She wrote: “I need security from you”.

Baloch is derided and feted in equal measure in Pakistan, but the popularity of her videos evidence frustrations of many young people tired of being told how to behave — her videos have been viewed thousands of times. She shot to fame in Pakistan in 2014.

Earlier this month, Qandeel released a music video which she starred in alongside young singer Aryan Khan. Titled 'Ban,' the music video touched on Qandeel's status as a controversial social media icon, and was provocative given Pakistan's conservative standards for entertainment.

Days later a man claiming to be Qandeel's ex-husband made an appearance on TV, saying that Qandeel had a son with him during their brief marriage.

Qandeel confirmed his claims, saying she was forced into the marriage.

Meanwhile, Mufti Qavi, who remained on the spotlight after his pictures with Qandeel Baloch appeared on social media which also cost him his position as Ruet-e-Hilal committee member, strongly condemned the murder of Qandeel Baloch. He said that he had already pardoned the late Qandeel after she attempted to defame him by leaking doctored pictures.

Response of famous personalities:

Oscar-winning Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy have taken to twitter to condemn the fatal attack on Qandeel Baloch for so-called honor today, ""How many women have to die before we pass the Anti Honor Killing Bill?""

Bakhtawar Bhutto and Asifa Bhutto, daughters of the former president Zardari and slain Benazir Bhutto stated: “No justification no honor no defence. An extreme e.g should be set against this heinous act beginning with her brothers arrest.”

A mother who duped her daughter into travelling to Pakistan to enter a forced marriage was sentenced on Wednesday to four-and-a-half years in prison, following the first successful prosecution of its kind in Britain.

The woman was found guilty on Tuesday following a trial at Birmingham Crown Court, in central England, where a jury heard how the girl sobbed as she was wedded to a male relative 16 years her senior.

""You had cruelly deceived her. She was frightened, alone, held against her will, being forced into a marriage she dreaded,"" said Judge Patrick Thomas QC in sentencing.

""You have sought to blame her for everything, and yourself have accepted responsibility for nothing.""

The girl was forced to marry the same man who had taken her virginity and left her pregnant on an earlier trip to Pakistan.

Then aged 13, she underwent an abortion on returning to Britain.

Concerns over the girl's welfare were allayed by her mother, who cannot be named to protect the identity of her daughter.

She said the pregnancy was a result of ""two teenagers who had sneakily had sex"", according to prosecutors.

Jurors heard how as the girl approached her 18th birthday she was tricked by her mother into returning to Pakistan on what she was told would be a family holiday.

The couple were then married in September 2016 despite objections from the girl, before she was returned to Britain with the assistance of the Home Office. Her mother was arrested in January 2017.

She was convicted of deceiving a victim into travelling abroad to enter into a false marriage - the first conviction of its kind - as well as other forced marriage and perjury charges.

It was found the defendant had lied about the incident in Britain's High Court, where she was summonsed when concerns were raised by authorities.

The new offence of forced marriage came into effect in June 2014, but prosecutions have been rare.

However the Forced Marriage Unit - a joint effort by the foreign and interior ministries - provided support to about 1,200 potential cases in 2017, a government spokesman said, making Britain a ""world leader"" in tackling the problem.",[],"Share:A mother who duped her daughter into travelling to Pakistan to enter a forced marriage was sentenced on Wednesday to four-and-a-half years in prison, following the first successful prosecution of its kind in Britain.

Marital rape is a real problem in our society but due to cultural taboos, people rarely discuss it. It is not recognized in a legal context. However, if we look elsewhere in the world, we will see that it is an important issue.

Any unwanted sexual act by a spouse or ex-spouse is committed without the other person’s consent. In Pakistan, though many people do not even consider it rape because they say how can you say that if you are in the nikkah of a man, how can he be a rapist? These people seem to forget that this binding contract does not give men a free license to abuse. They actually fail to understand that it is a sacred relationship.

Marital rape is not restricted to any particular age either. We just do not hear women talking about such grave matter, NGO who work on women’s issues says that they are reluctant to go to court on these issues. Therefore, it appears that legally and socially there is no support for women who suffer this crime.

https://nation.com.pk/31-Dec-2012/indian-gang-rape-victim-cremated-was-due-to-marry,2012-12-30 23:39:21+05:00,"Indian gang-rape victim cremated, was due to marry","Share:

NEW DELHI (AFP) - The victim of a gang-rape and murder which triggered an outpouring of grief and revulsion across India was cremated at a private ceremony on Sunday as it emerged she was planning to marry in February.

The unidentified 23-year-old, the focus of nationwide protests since she was attacked on a bus in New Delhi two weeks ago, was cremated at a ceremony kept secret by authorities only hours after her body was repatriated from Singapore.

The funeral pyre was lit after traumatised relatives and friends said their final prayers at a ceremony in southwestern Delhi, according to mourners who revealed she had been due to wed a boyfriend who was injured in the same attack.

""They had made all the wedding preparations and had planned a wedding party in Delhi"" for February, said Meena Rai, who was a close friend and neighbour. ""I really loved this girl. She was the brightest of all.""

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, the leader of the main ruling Congress party, were at Delhi airport to console her parents as they arrived home on a chartered plane with their daughter's body at around 4:00 am (2230 GMT).

After initial treatment in a Delhi hospital following the attack, she was flown to Singapore on Wednesday night where doctors were unable to prevent a multiple organ failure. She was pronounced dead in the early hours of Saturday.

Her killing has prompted government promises of better protection for women, and deep soul-searching in a nation where horrifying gang-rapes are commonplace and sexual harassment is routinely dismissed as ""Eve-teasing"". Several thousand people massed again on Sunday in the centre of the Indian capital - some to express sympathy for the victim who had been out to watch a film with her boyfriend, others to voice anger at the government.

Stringent security measures that have seen government offices and other public areas sealed off in New Delhi to prevent protests have been seized on by critics as further evidence of an out-of-touch government bungling its response. ""We cannot understand the high-handedness of the police. This is our city, we should be free to move around and protest peacefully,"" 21-year-old protester Mahima Anand, who works for a multi-national company, told AFP. ""She was not just one woman, she epitomises every Indian woman who has been wronged in some way or the other,"" she added from the Jantar Mantar area of Delhi, where protesters have been allowed to gather. About a dozen protesters tried to break the barricades that riot police erected around the area, while a handful also threw stones and were immediately detained.

The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also sent his condolences to the victim's parents and family on Sunday. ""Violence against women must never be accepted, never excused, never tolerated,"" Ban's spokesperson said. As police said the six accused of murdering the unnamed woman could face the death penalty, there was widespread determination that the killing should serve as a tipping point for how the nation deals with violence against women.

""We are aware that this is not the first case, nor will it be the last case of gang-rape in India, but it is clear that we will not tolerate sex crimes any more,"" said Bela Rana, a lawyer who joined a rally in central Delhi.

But Sunday's Hindustan Times said more than 20 women had been raped in New Delhi since December 16 and the Press Trust of India news agency reported another alleged murder and gang-rape on Sunday in the state of West Bengal.

According to police and prosecutors, the ordeal suffered by the victim of the Delhi crime began when six men lured her and her boyfriend onto a bus that they thought would take them home.

Instead the group, who had been drinking heavily, launched a savage attack lasting some 40 minutes that ended when the victims were thrown off the bus.

Protesters and the Indian media have demanded that the government unveil measures to make the country safer for women, while introspecting on how to uproot deep prejudice and misogyny in Indian society.

Initial government proposals include a public register for sex offenders and forcing convicted rapists to undergo chemical castration - the use of drugs to suppress sexual urges.

The government has already promised to bring in tougher sentences for the most extreme sex crimes and speed up a notoriously slow justice system that often fails to deliver timely verdicts.",[],"Share:NEW DELHI (AFP) - The victim of a gang-rape and murder which triggered an outpouring of grief and revulsion across India was cremated at a private ceremony on Sunday as it emerged she was planning to marry in February.

The parents of Sabika Sheikh, a Pakistani exchange student who was killed in the deadly mass shooting in a Texas high school two years ago, have started a foundation to keep her memory alive through providing university scholarships to low-income Pakistani women, according to a report in The Houston Chronicle.

Ms. Sheikh, 17, was among the 10 people killed in the 18 May 2018 shooting at Santa Fe High School near Houston, Texas. Thirteen others were wounded.

Her parents, Abdul Aziz Sheikh and Farah Naz, have created the Sabika for Peace Foundation to expand educational opportunities for those most in need, the Chronicle said.

“I’m always worried that we might forget (Sabika),” Farah Naz, the mother, told The Houston Chronicle during a Zoom interview with the family from their Karachi home. “But starting this foundation I know this is impossible. I know if I continue working with foundation, she will always be with me.”

The foundation is a partnership between the Sheikh family and several prominent nonprofit organizations, including the Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund and the American Council for International Education (ACIE), the report said. ACIE, the American Institute for Foreign Study and the International Education and Resource Network are providing a seed grant of $300,000 to establish the foundation, which will support programmes to “honor Sabika’s memory,” including by providing scholarships to fund university studies for low-income Pakistani women, particularly those with civic engagement aspirations.

Naz, Sabika’s mother, said that ACIE representatives approached the family prior to the coronavirus pandemic with the idea of honouring Sabika’s legacy through an educational foundation. While the pandemic presented some obstacles in getting the organization off the ground, in part because the academic year in Pakistan was postponed, the hope is that the foundation will be prepared to give out scholarships whenever Pakistani schools reopen.

“I’m always worried that we might forget (Sabika),” Naz said during the Zoom interview. “But starting this foundation I know this is impossible. I know if I continue working with foundation, she will always be with me.”

The Sheikh family said the scope of the foundation will target scholarships for universities in Pakistan for now, but will eventually expand to offering exchange opportunities for American schools “so that the connection and ties” with the United States continues, said Sania Sheikh, Sabika’s sister.

The new foundation will be led by a board of directors, which will include representatives from the Sheikh family as well as four independent directors selected by the family in consultation with the partnering organizations. Everytown for Gun Safety, which is representing Sabika’s parents in two civil lawsuits against the accused Santa Fe High School shooter’s parents and an online ammunition dealer, will maintain an advisory role with the foundation.

Sabika Sheikh came to Santa Fe High School in August 2017 as a youth ambassador with the State Department-sponsored Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study programme, which provides scholarships for secondary school students from countries with significant Muslim populations to spend one academic year in the United States.

She excelled academically and threw herself into the American teenage lifestyle, volunteering at the local library, dressing up as a pirate for Halloween, keeping score at baseball games and attending graduations, according to the report. At the time of the shooting in May 2018, Sheikh was weeks away from returning home to her family in Karachi.

Her sister, Sania Sheikh, said that despite Sabika’s distance from her family and the inherent difficulties being a young Muslim girl living in a small, rural, politically conservative Texas community, she believes Sabika cherished her school year in the United States.

“I think my sister spent the best days of her life in America,” Sania was quoted as saying.",[],"Ms. Sheikh, 17, was among the 10 people killed in the 18 May 2018 shooting at Santa Fe High School near Houston, Texas.

Note: Strong language. Readers discretion is advised

There was yet another murder that took place in Pakistan in the name of honor recently. It wasn’t a girl who chose to marry the person of her own choice, or a girl who did not want to marry the man her parents chose, or the girl who was caught talking to a boy on her cellphone.

This time, it was the murder of popular social media diva Qandeel Baloch. Like in most cases, her own family member (her brother this time) strangled her to death while she was sleeping. The coward chose a time when she would be least likely to fight back.

Some are saying that it was not an honor killing but rather a dispute about money. I guess they should have a conversation with her killer brother Waseem who had this to say:

“She was bringing disrepute to our family’s honor and I could not tolerate it any further. I killed her around 11.30pm on Friday night when everyone else had gone to bed.” Has cryptocurrencies' charm changed our perspective on money?

Thus honor killing.

However, this piece is not about Qandeel Baloch but rather the society she lived in; the people who raised her up only to push her down. The people who buzzed around her like sticky flies only to fling mud. The people who preached religion to her and told her she should be killed in the same breath.

Here are some gems that went around:

'I am not condoning what happened to her, I mean murder is wrong but she was asking for it.'

(Like how? Did she politely request people to kill her? How does one ask for it?)

'She paid the price.'

(Price of? Perverts ogling her 24/7?)

'She deserved it.'

(So you are saying murder is a perfectly acceptable thing then?)

'Oh no, now she was killed, people will start thinking of her as a heroine and all our girls will like nudity.' Pakistan to experience hot, dry weather in next 24 hours: PMD

(You certainly have your priorities in order! There is more to women then just their clothes, you know.)

'Although she was a disgrace… she should not have been killed.'

(I have no idea whether you are on her side or not…. Are you saying she should have been killed but no. Yes? No? Maybe?)

'This is what happens to girls who to go out of their homes.'

(Uhm, she was killed at home….by her own brother!)

Personally, I feel everyone in the society is to blame for her death, not just the murderer.

Uhm..that fell flat on its face. The ‘society’ is actually owning up to her murder or rather the condoning lady here.

Maybe for you Mr. Murderer Wannabe, but her family could have ignored her, or even disowned her. It’s not like she even used their name. However, let’s hope the ‘younger’ people don’t agree with your sickening way of thinking.

Nope, not much better!

Well, this Ahmed Mallick seems promising, he is just saying he never liked her and she is not a good Muslim. Definitely, better than others!

Uhm…

Wait... so you did like her then… You wanted to see her strip for you but are still happy she was killed? The sickness in your head, what is it called?

South Africa? I gather you know all the good bars where women dance there then? And she’s the one with the cheap mentality?

Also, being a mother is a crime now? What about her husband beating her the whole time they were married. That is okay?

Really? How much porn do you watch to be able to make such a conclusion by just seeing a picture?You must be one of the people who pushed up Pakistan in the “most porn watched” survey.

Are you against Qandeel here, or people who actually have this issue? Or her husband? Or are you just projecting?

Well, she was killed by her brother instead. Happy now? It’s what you wanted right? For her to die because she did not conform to the way you wanted her to live.

I have to hand it to you, at least you are honest about watching dirty dances with popcorn.

I really don’t understand why our people hate QandeelBaloch so much. They watch Bolywood item numbers with glee and a very disturbing smirk. They watch Game of Thrones just for the ‘scenes.’ Then why such a problem with Qandeel?

They could have just ignored her, it really is not that hard. However, I should not be hard on them; it’s just one single woman they hate. It’s not like they hate every woman out there. They must have really good reasons even if I don’t understand them.

Oh!

Didn’t Malala open schools for girls in Pakistan? Doesn’t she work for the equal rights for all? Doesn’t she emphasize on education? What is happening here!

Low cheap class? Malala? She is the youngest NobelPrize winner in the world. She is one of the reasons why the world looks up at us! If anything it is the likes of you who is hurting the image of Pakistan.

And hurting Islam? How?

I do wonder where yours and everyone else’s hateful comment were when the kids in Kasur were raped? When the girls were burnt alive in the name of honor. When acid was thrown on the faces of women. When Alisha was killed in Peshawar because the hospital would not treat her like a human being. I hope you do realize, it’s people like you who make Islam look bad.

And so I understand now, you have a problem with women who don’t wear the clothes you want them to, and also little girls who help the children in Pakistan.

This was a reply to when she posted pictures of little kids in her family. You call her dirty and cheap but this comment and everyone else who liked it are the ones with the dirty rotten minds. The least you can do is change your profile picture of Edhi sahab. He would never say such things or even think of stooping to such levels.

Yup, this is exactly what a good ‘naik Muslimah’ is supposed to sound like. Instead of guiding others, you curse them. Since you are so obsessed with gunah and all, please do tell me where it says you will be rewarded for being judgmental and talking down in such a manner. I am just asking but weren’t we told to be humble and patient?

And then came the other people who obviously had never sinned or done anything bad in their lives, upholding religion.

So who really is the one who was making Pakistan look bad?

Qandeel, who was simply part of show biz and wanted to be noticed and make a career, or the person who made lewd comments at her?

Qandeel, who was simply ambitious or the person who told her how he would kill her?

Qandeel, who was bold and said what she wanted and never lied about who she was or the hypocrite who spent hours staring at her pics and then cried about religion?

Qandeel, who never hurt anyone or asked anyone to or the person who repeatedly expressed happiness in her murder?

Qandeel, who still provided for her family or her brother who killed her over honor?

Rawalpindi-A man accused of killing a college girl after throwing acid on her at his house in Sadiqabad has been denied bail by a court of law here on Wednesday.

The accused had also attempted to rape the girl.

The police have arrested the alleged killer identified as Raja Faiser from courtroom and shifted him to police station for further investigation.

After hearing the arguments of both sides, Additional and Sessions Judge (ASJ) Ajmal Raja rejected the interim bail of Raja Faiser who was involved in shooting Minal Raja, his wife’s neice, in the head with a 30 bore pistol after throwing acid on her.

The investigators of Homicide Investigation Unit (HIU) of Police Station Sadiqabad arrested the accused from courtroom.

Muhammad Afzal Khan Jadoon, the prosecution, argued before court that Minal Raja was living in her aunt’s house in Sadiqabad and studying in a private college. He added that Raja Faiser, the uncle the girl, had tried to assault sexually her and threw acid on her when she resisted. “The accused even burned the sensitive parts of the girl’s body with acid and later on killed her by shooting her in the head with a 30-bore pistol,” the prosecutor said. He mentioned after killing the girl, the killer had put pistol in her hand in a bid to give the impression that she had committed suicide. In the medical as well as forensic report, it was proven that the girl was burnt with acid before getting shot.

The lawyer told court that police investigators had also detected the last phone call by Raja Faiser to Minal Raja asking her to come to get her memory card before her murder. Muhammad Afzal Khan Jadoon Advocate prayed to the judge to reject the interim bail of the accused. Opposing the arguments of prosecution, the defence lawyer Raja Abid said his client was being roped in the murder case by his relatives without any reason. He said his client was not present in the city at time of occurrence of incident. On this, Muhammad Afzal Advocate told judge police had also recovered the weapon that used in the murder that was also owned by Raja Faiser.

After completion of arguments of both parties, ASJ Ajmal Raja rejected the interim bail of killer and ordered police to arrest him. Following court order, police held the killer from courtroom and shifted him to PS Sadiqabad.

Islamabad-Additional and Sessions Judge (ASJ) Islamabad (West) Muhammad Atta Rabbani on Wednesday rejected the bail plea of PPP leader Nasir Khan Bangu in a rape case.

Earlier, a magistrate in federal capital on September 18 sent Bangu, who is facing charges of raping a girl on gunpoint, to Adiala Jail on 14-day judicial remand after a team of police told judge that they have completed investigation from the accused and needed no more custody of him.

When ASJ Muhammad Atta Rabbani took up the rape case, Zafar Khokhar Advocate appeared before the judge and argued that his client was roped in a bogus rape case.

He said he is a political figure of his area while his political opponents had implicated him in the rape case. He requested judge to grant his client bail in the case.

Opposing the arguments of the lawyer, Ms Aliya Zareen Abbasi Advocate said her client was victimised as she was needy and poor.

“Usually it is not easy for the family of the victim to come forward and set the law in motion in cases of rape. Rape is molestation that the generations have to suffer hence the accused cannot be extended any benefit while considering the bail,” she argued.

The court must observe the previous criminal conduct of the accused and in this particular case the defense has failed to highlight any motive, previous enmity or mala fide on the part of the complainant who is an innocent girl of 20 years only, she said.

Therefore, the court should reject bail plea of accused, argued Aliya Zareen Abbasi Advocate.

After completion of arguments of both parties, ASJ Muhamamd Atta Rabbani rejected the bail of Nasir Khan Bangu in the rape case.

On 7/9/2020, a young girl namely Saima lodged complaint with PS Karachi Company that she was raped by Nasir Abbas Khan on gunpoint after luring her for a job. Police rounded up the alleged rapist after filing a case against him.

A team of investigators of PS Karachi Company had brought the handcuffed PPP leader Nasir Bungu before the court of Area Magistrate Malik Aman on September 18 and pleaded the interrogation from accused was done and his physical custody needed no more by police.

In any conflict, whether it’s a war between states or a civil war of state’s repression against one ethnic or religious group, women along with children are the most vulnerable groups that suffer violence. According to UN Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict, the vast majority of casualties in today’s wars are among civilians, mostly women and children. Women in particular face devastating forms of sexual violence, which is sometimes deployed systematically to achieve a military or political objective.

After a visit to Cox Bazar, Pramila Patten, a special representative of the UN Secretary-General on sexual violence in conflict held Myanmar’s soldiers responsible for the systematic targeting of Rohingya women for gang-rape during violence against the minority Muslim community which triggered an exodus to Bangladesh. While talking to the reporters, she said that many women and girls had died because of the rapes. For the sexual violence that was commanded and orchestrated in Rakhine, she accused the armed forces of Myanmar.

The civilian government’s silence on military’s involvement in sexual crimes is nothing but a tool to accelerate the evacuation process in the Rakhine region. Myanmar’s silence on sexual aggressions of its soldiers is a disregard for international rules and treaties that aim to protect women from acts of sexual violence.

Even if the conflict ends in the near future, the acts of sexual violence will haunt these victims. The impacts of sexual violence persist in many forms including unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections and stigmatization. Fears are that widespread sexual violence may continue or even increase in the aftermath of conflict, as a consequence of insecurity and impunity.

In the light of the findings that have surfaced this Sunday, it is international community’s responsibility of utmost importance to constitute a tribunal to punish those involved in acts of sexual violence against Rohingya women. Letting these people go free will encourage other to unleash their bestiality against women in other conflict-hit areas.",[],"Women in particular face devastating forms of sexual violence, which is sometimes deployed systematically to achieve a military or political objective.

""A tragedy that cannot be overcome by money alone, that cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms,

which even aggravates the problems"".

–Pope Benedict XVI, 17 March 2009.

The papacy has often found itself on the wrong side of changing times, especially when it comes to matters relating to sexuality and tolerance. Pope Benidict’s(pictured above) remarks on the AIDs problem in Africa on the eve of this trip to Cameroon caused widespread criticism, and he was forced to backtrack. This wasn’t the only problem the papacy had to face in his term, he was dogged by a series of crises and controversies on issues ranging from child abuse, Islam and homosexuality to the Holocaust – which isn’t surprising considering the conservative views held by most of the catholic clergy.

Following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI on 28 February 2013, a papal conclave elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March – known now as Pope Francis. The new pope has surprised quite a few people with his progressive views. He famously ditched the ornate regalia of the office and chooses to appear in simple attire. He has also addressed issues his predecessors chose to avoid – such as dealing with the long and shameful history of cover-up of child abuse within the Church, and arguing for a more inclusive treatment and outlook on homosexuals. He might be described as a “maverick” pope, but it must be remembered that his a maverick according to papal standards; he maintains the traditional views of the church regarding abortion, euthanasia, contraception, ordination of women, and priestly celibacy.",[],"Share:""A tragedy that cannot be overcome by money alone, that cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms,which even aggravates the problems"".

ISLAMABAD - A minor girl is struggling for life at a local hospital after someone possibly assaulted and then threw her in the bushes near her home in a Bhara Kahu locality on Monday night, according to the police.

Zafar Abbas, son of Allah Baksh, resident of Bhara Kahu, told the police that some unidentified person picked his daughter Fatima Zafar, 4, when she was standing in front of the house on the night of July 8.

“She was enjoying rain when some unknown person picked her and later threw her in the nearby bushes after abusing and strangling her throat,” he narrated. The parents later found the minor unconscious and immediately shifted her to Polyclinic hospital and later to the PIMS hospital. She is under treatment in the ICU of the hospital, according to the police. The police have registered a case against unidentified accused under section 377-B, 324 of the PPC and further investigation is underway.

According to DIG (Operations) Islamabad Waqar-ud-Din Syed, they had constituted two teams to ensure arrest of the accused involved in the rape case registered at Bhara Kahu police station. One team would be headed by SP (Investigation) Dr Syed Mustafa Tanveer and the other by SP (City) Aamir Khan Niazi to arrest the culprit.

Recently, abortions rates are on a rise in Pakistan as abortions have become the only means to exercise birth control. Most of these abortions are being conducted in unsafe environments which adds on to the problems faced by women in the country.

The shadow of patriarchal social norms is being reflected in the form of high rate of unintended pregnancies which further allows room for high abortion rates in Pakistan. Undoubtedly it’s a vicious circle of patriarchy that haunts and transfers the suffering on to women. Women continue to suffer in the suffocating male-centered environment, plagued by unsafe abortions, forced marriages, attacks, rape etc. An active effort needs to be made to introduce programs and seminars focusing on awareness on violence against women. Additionally, to tackle the rising abortion rates, added awareness needs to be carried out on the availability of various contraceptive methods.

Indeed, it is difficult to completely eradicate existing patriarchic norms in the Pakistani society until or unless a holistic and strategic approach is applied.

ISLAMABAD - An Indian girl, who is currently in Pakistan, moved a local court Monday, claiming that she was forced to marry a Pakistani citizen at gunpoint.

Judicial Magistrate Syed Haider Shah conducted the hearing on her complaint filed under the section 200 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).

Indian Dr Uzma alleged in her plea that Pakistani Tahir Ali harassed and abused her after she came to Pakistan. She expressed her resolve not to leave the Indian High Commission in Islamabad till her safe repatriation.

She told the court that she met Tahir in Malaysia and they became friends. She said Tahir ‘forced her to get a Pakistani visa and visit him’.

“As I crossed the Wagah border into Pakistan, Tahir picked me up in a car and, after travelling a short distance, I was drugged and fell unconscious,” she alleged, adding that when she woke up at 10pm, she found herself in Tahir’s home in a strange village with strange people.

She went on to say: “That night, Tahir sexually assaulted and tortured me and threatened to kill me if I did not sign the Nikahanama (marriage contract) next day. The next day, they brought me to a dirty and strange house, forced me to sign the marriage contract at gunpoint. They made me marry forcefully for which I was not mentally ready as soon as marriage was done. Then, they started torturing me mentally, beating me and made me do all the household work.”

INP adds: Tahir accused the Indian mission of ‘detaining’ his wife as she went there to apply for visa – a claim rejected by the Indian officials.

Tahir reported to the Islamabad’s Secretariat Police Station that his wife hails from New Delhi and the pair first met in Malaysia. ""Uzma travelled to Pakistan on May 1 via the Wagha border, and we got married in Buner on May 3,"" Tahir stated.

According to Tahir, after the couple tied the knot, Uzma called her brother in New Delhi to relay the news to him. Her brother asked her to visit India on her honeymoon and told her she could find a man, named Adnan, at the Indian embassy who would be able to sort out their visas for the trip, Tahir alleged.

""At the Indian embassy window, she asked about Adnan. A while later, a man came out and took her inside through gate number six. I waited and waited, and then at 7pm I asked at the embassy gate if my wife was inside. They told me no one was inside,"" Tahir claimed.

He added that he then returned to the main gate on a shuttle bus, and noted that none of the three phones surrendered to the embassy by the couple at the time of entrance were returned to him.

After waiting for quite long, Tahir inquired about his wife but the commission refused to return her back.

He added: “Two days after we got married, we visited the Indian High Commission in Islamabad to obtain an Indian visa, following which I lost contact with my wife.“

The Indian High Commission told Pakistan Foreign Office that Uzma had approached them with the request to be repatriated to India after learning about Tahir’s first marriage and his four children.

The Pakistani authorities declared that the Indian citizen did not disclose her plans to marry in Pakistan when she applied for the visa and instead expressed her intent to visit her relatives in Pakistan.

The Indian mission arranged an attorney for Uzma and provided her with transportation and security to appear before the court for hearing. The court issued notices to respondents, including her husband, and put off the hearing until May 11.",['Shahid Rao'],"Share:ISLAMABAD - An Indian girl, who is currently in Pakistan, moved a local court Monday, claiming that she was forced to marry a Pakistani citizen at gunpoint.

https://nation.com.pk/12-Apr-2011/07m-girls-are-killed-in-india-every-year,2011-07-02 00:00:00,0.7m girls are killed in India every year,"Share:

Over eight million girls are estimated to have been killed in the last decade alone leading to a dipping in the child sex ratio from 927 in 2001 to 914 in 2011. Sabu George is an activist who has been working on the issue of the girl child for over 25 years and tells this writer why there is a need to act immediately to boost the child sex ratio by the next Census in 2021: Why do you insist that the killing of the girl child is a crime and not just a social evil? It is not a few hundreds, the killing of girls is happening in millions. It is genocide. In China, an estimated 1.2 million girls are killed every year in their obsession for sons and the one-child policy. In India, an estimated 0.7 million girls are killed each year. In the coming decade, we will exceed the Chinese in killing girls. We will then have the dubious distinction of being the country eliminating the largest number of girls every year along with the distinction of holding other dubious world records like having the largest proportion of starving children, highest maternal mortality and so on. In recent history, Partition is considered to be the most traumatic and violent event when over a million people were killed. But it is an even bigger tragedy that an estimated eight million girls were killed in the last decade. In the coming decade, over 10 million girls will be killed if something is not done immediately. In a historical context, we havent seen this magnitude of violence in our society or an event of this magnitude in terms of future consequences. Is the government doing enough to improve the sex ratio? Obviously no. In 1991 it was evident from the Census that in Gujarat, Punjab and Haryana five per cent of girls were eliminated. But nothing was done till 2001 when this went up to 10-15 per cent of girls being eliminated. The government and the country sat up and took notice, but little has been done. This is evident from the fact that even in parts of the country which were helping to keep the countrys overall sex ratio high, we are seeing a huge drop in the sex ratio. This shows that the practice of killing the girl child, instead of being curbed, is actually spreading everywhere. Why do you think the government does not do enough to curb sex selection? Many people in the government and among the elite believe sex selection will bring down population growth. From the 1970s doctors and many policy makers have been advocating sex selection as a way to bring down population. Of the five million less children born in the last decade, boys accounted for two million of the reduction and girls for three million. This means the relative decline of girls is more than 50 per cent of the reduction rate of boys. Yet, no one seems to care that the population reduction has come at the cost of girls who are being systematically killed. What, in your opinion, is the most effective way to improve the child sex ratio? There is only one way and that is to implement the law. We have a strong law meant to punish those engaged in the practice of sex determination and sex selective abortion - the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act 1994. Doctors have always promoted sex determination. The government has to start with tackling the criminal malpractice among doctors. You have to make it tough and not at all worth their while to indulge in this malpractice.

LAHORE - Four people including a 10-year-old boy were killed in accidents which took place in different parts of the provincial metropolis on Saturday, police and rescue workers said.

“One in four girls will experience sexual abuse by the time she is sixteen, and 48 percent of all rapes involve a young woman under the age of eighteen. It’s not surprising then, that in a society where sexual abuse of young women is rampant, many women never share their stories..”

Teen Girls, Young Women, and Everyone Who Cares About Them (2005).

Rape culture is the belief that rape is largely tolerated and that rapists get away with their crime because it is implicitly accepted by society. The fact that the judicial system is failing women is not an indication that rape is okay. How often is justice served to murderers or to other criminals in general?

Since most sexual abuse begins well before puberty, preventive education, if it is to have any effect at all, should begin early in grade school. Ideally, information on sexual abuse should be integrated into a general curriculum of sex education. In those communities where the experiment has been tried, it has been shown conclusively that children can learn what they most need to know about sexual abuse, without becoming unduly frightened or developing generally negative sexual attitudes.",[],"Share:“One in four girls will experience sexual abuse by the time she is sixteen, and 48 percent of all rapes involve a young woman under the age of eighteen.

KARACHI - Anti-Violent Crime Cell (AVCC) and Citizen Police Liaison Committee (CPLC) on Wednesday claimed to have arrested three members of outlawed militant organisation Daesh, who were also involved in abduction of citizens and other terror activities.

The police also recovered weapon, a vehicle and over Rs 10 million from the possession of the accused.

In a press conference addressed by DIG CIA Ameen Ullah Yousafzai, it was informed that the three accused abducted a person namely Muhammad Raheel on February 06, 2018 from Gulistan-e-Jauhar block 6 and case 36/18 was registered against unknown men.

The abductors demanded a ransom of Rs 100 million and later agreed on an amount of Rs 10.15 million. The family paid the ransom and secured the safety of their loved one. The police then started investigations into the case and was able to trace the culprits after successful raids in suburb areas of Karachi and some parts of Balochistan.

The accused that were arrested were identified as Rooh Ullah, Mukhtiar and Naeem. “Initially they were treated as abductors but further investigations revealed their link to banned outfit Daesh’s Pakistan network,” said the DIG CIA.

The accused were involved in other criminal and terror activities and other than abducting a person named Abid Sohail, who was later killed for not paying ransom, they also ended up with failed abduction bids of a person named Naeem and a trader Ashraf Tai from SITE Area.

“They were also involved in killing four Shiite persons besides also killing a policeman and two informers of police in separate incidents,” said Ameen Ullah Yousafzai.

Speaking on the links with the terror outfit, the DIG CIA said that one of their accomplices Musharraf Mehsud was killed after he jumped from a rooftop trying to evade arrest in Karachi. “Deash Pakistan chief Mufti Hidayat Ullah and its Quetta chief Salman Badeni were also killed,” he said adding that four of the accomplices are still on the run and the police are after them.

Four held over

honour killing

Police claimed to have arrested four accused persons involved in the killing of newlywed-woman who was allegedly killed by her relatives in the name of honour in the outskirts of the city.

Police officials said that the victim’s relatives including father-in-law, namely Saifur Rehman had killed the victim and later buried her at a graveyard in Janjar Goth in Gulshan-e-Maymar.

https://nation.com.pk/12-Oct-2012/china-s-mo-yan-wins-nobel-prize-for-literature,2012-10-12 00:23:09+05:00,China’s Mo Yan wins Nobel prize for literature,"Share:

STOCKHOLM (AFP) - Mo Yan, one of China’s leading writers of the past half-century, on Thursday won the Nobel Literature Prize for his writing that mixes folk tales, history and the contemporary, the Swedish Academy announced.

Mo Yan, 57, became the first Chinese national to win the prize, and the initial official reaction indicated it would be held up as a victory for China, in sharp contrast to Beijing’s angry response to the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize for dissident Liu Xiaobo.

Chinese-born writer, political dissident and exile Gao Xingian, who received French citizenship in 1997, won the Nobel Literature Prize in 2000 but it was ignored by the Chinese press at the time.

Mo Yan’s works explore the brutality and darkness of 20th-century Chinese society with a cynical wit.

He is perhaps best-known abroad for his 1987 novella “Red Sorghum”, a tale of the brutal violence that plagued the eastern China countryside — where he grew up — during the 1920s and 30s.

The story was later made into an acclaimed film by leading Chinese director Zhang Yimou.

“Through a mixture of fantasy and reality, historical and social perspectives, Mo Yan has created a world reminiscent in its complexity of those in the writings of William Faulkner and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, at the same time finding a departure point in old Chinese literature and in oral tradition,” the Swedish Academy said.

“On hearing the news that I won the award, I was very happy,” Mo Yan was quoted as saying by the official China News Service.

“I will focus on creating new works. I will strive harder to thank everyone.”

The Nobel prize is often dismissed in China as Western-focused, but users of the country’s hugely popular microblogging services broadly welcomed the win as triumph for Chinese literature.

It was the most discussed topic on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, with almost three million web-users posting messages within two hours of the announcement.

The Swedish Academy hailed Mo Yan, a pseudonym that means “Don’t speak”, and whose real name is Guan Moye, for a body of work which, “with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary.”

The Academy’s permanent secretary, Peter Englund, said the Academy had spoken to Mo Yan by telephone and quoted him as saying he was “overjoyed and terrified” at being given the prize.

Englund said his use of satire was important to be able to enjoy the dark sides in his work, describing it as both crude and sensual.

“There are things (in his books) that are among the most frightening things I have read,” Englund told Sweden’s Aftonbladet TV.

Mo Yan has published novels, short stories and essays on various topics, and despite his social criticism is seen in his homeland as one of the foremost contemporary authors, the Nobel committee noted.

His acclaimed works also include “Big Breasts and Wide Hips”, “Republic of Wine” and “Life and Death are Wearing Me Out”.

His work generally looks back at China’s tumultuous 20th century in tales often infused with politics and a dark, cynical sense of humour.

The backdrops for his various works have included the 1911 revolution that toppled China’s last imperial dynasty, Japan’s brutal wartime invasion, newly Communist China’s failed land-reform policies of the 1950s and the madness of Mao Zedong’s 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.

His latest novel, 2009’s “Frog”, is considered his most daring yet, due to its searing depiction of China’s “one child” population control policy and the local officials who ruthlessly implement it with forced abortions and sterilisations.

Despite such content, Mo Yan has so far deftly managed to avoid running into serious trouble with Communist authorities, aided by his position as vice chairman of the state-sanctioned Chinese Writers Association.

“We are very happy. This is a happy thing for the China literary world,” He Jianming, another vice chairman of the association, said on Thursday after the prize was announced.

Mo Yan has also supported official policies stating that art and literature must serve the socialist cause — and, by extension, not threaten Communist Party rule.

The author grew up in Gaomi in Shandong province in northeastern China, the son of farmers.

As a 12-year-old during the Cultural Revolution he left school to work, first in agriculture, later in a factory and in 1976 he joined the People’s Liberation Army and began to study literature and write.

His first short story was published in a literary journal in 1981.

The Nobels for medicine, physics and chemistry were announced earlier this week.

The peace prize will be announced on Friday, with the field of possible winners wide open, followed by the economics prize on Monday, wrapping up the Nobel season.

As tradition dictates, the laureates will receive their prizes at ceremonies in Stockholm and Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of the death of prize creator Alfred Nobel in 1896.

Because of the economic crisis, the Nobel Foundation has slashed the prize sum to eight million Swedish kronor ($1.2 million) per award, down from the 10 million kronor awarded since 2001.",[],"Share:STOCKHOLM (AFP) - Mo Yan, one of China’s leading writers of the past half-century, on Thursday won the Nobel Literature Prize for his writing that mixes folk tales, history and the contemporary, the Swedish Academy announced.

https://nation.com.pk/04-Dec-2016/violence-against-women,2016-12-04 02:08:05+05:00,Violence against women,"Share:

Violence against women (VAW), also known as gender-based violence, is violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman> women. Sometimes it is considered as a <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime> hate crime.

This type of violence targets a specific group with the victim's <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender> gender as a primary motive and is eventually gender-based, meaning that the acts of violence are committed against women and girls expressly because of their gender.

The UN <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_on_the_Elimination_of_Violence_Against_Women> Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women states that: ""Violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women"" and that ""violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men”.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan> Kofi Annan, former <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations> Secretary-General of the United Nations, declared in a 2006 report posted on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Fund_for_Women United Nations Development Fund for Women(UNIFEM) website that:

Violence against women and girls is a problem of <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic> pandemic proportions. At least one out of every three women around the world has been beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime with the abuser usually someone known to her.

As such, violence against women and Honour Killings are serious human rights violation and are condemned throughout the world. To raise awareness and trigger action to end this global scourge, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women is observed on 25th November every year.

Sometime, it takes a tragedy to jolt people into action against an injustice and such was the case when, on November 25, 1960, the three Mirabel sisters, Patria, Minerva and María, were assassinated on the orders of Rafael Trujillo, a Dominican politician, who ruled the Dominican Republic from February 1930 until his assassination in May 1961.

Minerva, who was a lawyer, wanted to rid their country of dictatorship and also to fight violence against women. As such, Minerva, along with her sisters formed a group 'Las Mariposas' (the butterflies) and fought clandestinely to expose Trujillo’s crimes. Six months after the Mirabel sisters' death, Trujillo was assassinated by one of his associates.

Las Mariposas resistance against tyranny and fight for democracy and violence against women inspired the UN General Assembly to designate 25 November as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.

Then on 6 December 1989, a student at the University of Montreal killed 14 female students. Distressed by this incident, a group of men from Toronto decided to work to stop violence against women. The White Ribbon Movement came into being as a result of their efforts and now, civil rights organisations hold an awareness-raising event (White Ribbon Day) between 25 November and 6 December every year. This year's theme is “Orange the World: Raise Money to End Violence against Women and Girls.”

According to Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) 900 rapes and sexual assaults were reported in 2015 in addition to 279 instances of domestic violence, 143 of burning, 833 of kidnapping and 777 of suicide and attempted suicide.

Also, during 2015, the report showed 987 honour crimes, with 1,096 female victims and 88 male victims, including an unknown number of children. The report is based on the complaints lodged with the police. Sadly, most victims of abuse and rape are afraid to go to police.

Unfortunately, violence against women is a norm in our society and seeking redress against it is considered even a greater crime. A woman who wants to lodge a complaint against her father, brother or husband has to face stiff resistance. Family members and the police try their level best to stop the women from lodging an FIR (First Information Report).

Aurat Foundation estimates that 8,500 women face violation in the country every year - the majority of these cases are of domestic violence, which takes place inside the home. Domestic abuse can be physical, emotional or psychological and can happen to anyone, anywhere.

The most unfortunate aspect of domestic violence is that people tend to blame the abused woman who is accused of not doing her job properly and therefore needs to be punished and thus deserves the beatings. Every day we hear of a woman being raped, a girl disfigured by acid, or burnt to death or women killed in the name of honour. Meanwhile, countless women also suffer endlessly at the hands of their male family members.

In difficult marital situations, the suffering of girls is not taken seriously and they are told by their parents to bear the hardships in silence, for divorce would bring dishonour to the family. This situation is not limited to the lower or middle classes, as women of upper middle and upper classes also put up with a lot of suffering to save their marriages.

In view of the rising violence against women, the Punjab Assembly passed the Punjab Protection of Women Against Violence Act 2015, which, sadly, was termed un-Islamic by the Council of Islamic Ideology (CCI).

Even Maulana Fazlur Rehman, the chief of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, said the law was in conflict with both Islam and the constitution of Pakistan and at a press conference, he said, ""This law makes a man insecure."" Only a man who is a coward will feel insecure at the passage of legislation to protect women!

Also, the National Assembly passed a bill against honour killing on 6 October 2016, plugging a loophole to prevent the murderer getting off scot-free. People who kill in the name of honour will still have to serve life imprisonment even if the victim's relatives forgive the murderer.

Marking the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on November 25, the Sindh Assembly unanimously passed a resolution, calling on the provincial government to take necessary measures to prevent physical and mental abuse of women.

The resolution reads, “The Sindh Assembly remembers 25 November as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and demands that the Sindh government take measures to control it”.

“This House also commits to providing basic rights to women and condemns mental and physical torture on women. This House also commits that all possible laws will be framed to provide basic rights to women of Sindh. This House should also commit to providing equal status to women politically and socially in all of Sindh.”

Now that the above resolution has been passed and adopted, one can only hope and pray that an appropriate law will be passed soon and that it will be enforced in letter and spirit. But unfortunately, our past track record indicates that this is never the case.

NEW DELHI: India's top court on Monday upheld death sentences for three men convicted over the notorious 2012 gang-rape and murder of a woman that sparked national protests and soul-searching.

Jyoti Singh, a physiotherapy student, was raped and left for dead by a gang of five men and a teenager on a bus in the Indian capital New Delhi in December 2012.

The 23-year-old woman, on course to be the first professional in the family, was coming home from the cinema with a male friend.

The six-strong gang beat the man unconscious before raping and torturing Singh with an iron bar as the private bus drove loops through the Indian capital.

She was dumped on the streets after 45 minutes with horrific internal injuries and died 13 days later in a Singapore hospital.

The brutality of the attack, and her determination to survive long enough to identify her attackers to police, triggered angry demonstrations by tens of thousands of people in Delhi and nationwide.

The case also put the treatment of women in the world´s largest democracy in the global spotlight and led to heavier sentences for sex crimes.

Four of the men were convicted in September 2013 for murder, gang-rape, theft, conspiracy and ""unnatural acts"" after a seven-month trial in a fast-track court.

All four maintain their innocence. Only three of them were involved in the appeal rejected on Monday by the Supreme Court.

A fifth man, the suspected ringleader, was found dead in jail in a suspected suicide, while a 17-year-old was sentenced to three years in a detention centre and has since been released.

The victim´s parents on Monday welcomed the ruling, with her mother Asha Singh saying it was ""very happy news"".

""It´s a great message for the entire society. This verdict is meant for society, women and all of us,"" father Badrinath Singh told reporters.

But the defendants´ lawyer said he would file a curative petition, the last legal challenge. If that fails they could seek a pardon from the president.

""Justice should be for everyone. Injustice has been meted out to them. The court has taken a decision against these kids (convicts) under political and media pressure,"" A. P. Singh told reporters.

40,000 rapes

Following the 2012 case and subsequent protests, some of which were violent, there were demands to overhaul the laws on sexual assaults.

A panel entrusted with reviewing legislation rejected public appeals for the death penalty for rape but boosted the jail terms to 20 years.

But the government then buckled under public pressure and approved capital punishment for repeat offenders.

There were some 40,000 rapes reported in India in 2016, according to the most recent official figures available.

But activists say this is just the tip of the iceberg as many victims are afraid to report the crimes due to threats by perpetrators or the social stigma attached to sexual assaults.

In recent months a string of sex attacks, mostly of children, have caused further outrage and protests.

This included the attack on an eight-year-old girl from a Muslim nomadic community in January.

The girl from the northern Jammu region died after being kidnapped, drugged and gang raped by several men for days at a Hindu temple.

This led to the introduction of the death sentence for raping girls younger than 12.

Death row

More than 1,300 people have been sentenced to death in the past decade, and India ranks 10th globally in the number of sentences handed down.

India rejected a 2007 UN-sponsored moratorium plea on executions amid an ongoing debate on capital punishment.

More than 370 convicts were on death row as on December 2017, the last official count, down from 399 the previous year.

But many were spared the noose by higher courts on appeals, including 35 who were acquitted outright.

Out of the 371 death row convicts in 2017, 43 were awarded the ultimate punishment for crimes involving fatal sexual assaults.

But India carries out very few hangings.

Just four convicts have been executed in the last 25 years, including Dhananjoy Chatterjee in 2004 for the rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl.

The three other hangings in 2010, 2011 and 2015 were for terrorism.",[],"Share:NEW DELHI: India's top court on Monday upheld death sentences for three men convicted over the notorious 2012 gang-rape and murder of a woman that sparked national protests and soul-searching.

SARGODHA - Violence against women has been assuming pandemic proportions, which warrants zero tolerance policy to check sexual harassment and domestic violence against women. Special measures must be taken to empower women as social and economic development cannot be attained without empowering half portion of the population.

This was the crux of speeches made at a daylong seminar titled “End of Violence against Women and Girls” arranged by the Department of Sociology and Criminology, Sargodha University in collaboration with the Punjab Commission on the Status of Women (PCSW).

The seminar aimed at raising awareness about women and girls who are subjected to sexual abuse, domestic violence and other forms of violence while highlighting the role of women in economic and social development of the country.

Prominent among the speakers were PCSW Divisional Coordinator Talawat Hussain, Social Worker Rukhsana Bhatti, Women Sub-Inspector Anam Sarfraz and Assistant Professor Sociology Asma Younas. A large number of students and faculty members attended the seminar.

Speaking on the occasion, Talawat Hussain stated that women comprised 52 percent of the country’s total population and they must be provided with equal rights, opportunities and facilities so that they could play their effective role in the development of Pakistan.

He briefed the seminar that PCSW is making legislation pertaining to legal counselling of the victims and cyber harassment to safeguard rights of women and to empower them by building their confidence and helping them in overcoming inferiority complex.

Sub-Inspector Anam was of the view that there is a dire need to encourage the domestic violence and sexual harassment victims to report the incidents as most of them do not opt to do so. She informed that in last eight months, 761 cases of sexual harassment, domestic violence and honour killing have been registered in Punjab which show that the violence against women has been escalating to pandemic proportions.

It may be added here that the seminar was a part of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence Campaign marked internationally every year from 25 November to 10 December to galvanize action to end violence against women and girls around the world.",['Our Staff Report'],"Share:SARGODHA - Violence against women has been assuming pandemic proportions, which warrants zero tolerance policy to check sexual harassment and domestic violence against women.

ISLAMABAD - Survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) on Friday performed in a theatre play ‘Inspiring Change’ organised by Aurat Foundation under USAID supported Gender Equity Programme (GEP).

""It was like telling our story to the world. We did not have to act,"" said Warda, a survivor of acid attack, who performed on the stage for the first time. ""I enjoyed doing this play thoroughly. We appreciate the organisers for providing us with this opportunity,"" she added.

The performance was themed around social mindset that terms domestic violence a private matter. Theatrical performance by GBV survivors was the result of intensive training and rehearsals with GBV survivors conducted by Director Interactive Resource Centre Muhammad Waseem and choreographer Imran Nafees.

""It took us fifteen days to prepare for this play. The GBV survivors were incredible in all sense. We are also impressed with the level of confidence they have displayed,"" said Director Interactive Resource Center Muhammad Waseem.

Combating GBV is one of the four main objectives of GEP. To meet this objective, GEP supported private shelters for psychosocial counselling and economic rehabilitation of GBV survivors. Under this initiative, GEP provided support to 12 private shelters, 954 women took refuge in these shelters, 598 were rehabilitated and 1,870 were trained for economic rehabilitation under 94 trainings.

Rehabilitation centres applied many innovative techniques to rehabilitate the GBV survivors. One such technique was drama therapy which was meant to combine theatre techniques and choreography with psychological intervention method.

To further rehabilitate and encourage the GBV survivors and highlight their resolve to live and contribute as useful citizens, the GEP team decided to involve the GBV survivors trained under different GEP projects, in its main events.

The theatrical performance on IWD was part of the same effort. It provided GBV survivors of Dastak and Acid Survivors Foundation with an opportunity to exhibit their talent besides further rehabilitating them. At the end, anchorperson Qurat-ul-Ain Ali distributed certificates among the survivors. She said that In Pakistan, GBV is a complex issue and major forms of violence are considered private matter, as it occurs in the family.

It provided GBV survivors of Dastak and Acid Survivors Foundation with an opportunity to exhibit their talent besides further rehabilitating them.","['shelters', 'drama', 'women', 'gbv', 'gep', 'private', 'trained', 'violence', 'survivors', 'play', 'performance']","{'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/rsss.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/android_app_on_play_logo_small.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/g_plus.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/linkedin_share.png', 'https://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619912693.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png?date=2019-02-15', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/twitter.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_publishrr.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/utube.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/uploads/theme/logo-1550475639.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619902433.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2014-03-08/1394233843-9149.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/whatsapp_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2014-03-08/1394224854-5098.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/facebook.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/app-store.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2014-03-08/1394224854-5098.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png'}",True,https://nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2014-03-08/1394224854-5098.jpg,1,,,,,nation

ISLAMABAD-The police registered a case against Station House Officer Shahzad Town Sub Inspector Abbas Rana along with other police officials for his inaction a day after he was suspended on the charges of ‘poor performance, inefficiency and sheer negligence towards official duties’ when it came to action in the Farishta rape and killing case.

Gul Nabi, the victim’s father, got registered the First Information Report at the Shahzad Town police station on Wednesday under Section 166 (public servant disobeying law with intent to cause injury to any person) of Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). Nabi stated in the FIR that the victim’s family had approached the police a number of times to help find Farishta, and register an FIR in the matter, but instead of searching for the missing girl, the SHO told them that she must have run away with someone.

Farishta, 10, went missing from her home in Ali Pur in the jurisdiction of Shahzad Town police station on May 15 but the police registered FIR on application of Gul Nabi under section 365-B against unknown persons on May 19. Her 4-day-old body was found from a forest a day after registration of the FIR with the police suspecting that she was raped before the murder.

Nabi alleged that instead of registering an FIR, the police officials continued to put questions. The aggrieved father said that he had been mistreated by the police every time he visited the police station.

The father had called for action against the SHO and other officials involved in negligence. The results of a post-mortem examination conducted on Tuesday are awaited, and samples have also been taken for a DNA test to confirm the victim’s identity. The family had protested against the alleged police inaction in Islamabad’s Trammari Chowk on Tuesday and SHO Rana was suspended from duty in order to ensure a transparent inquiry into the case.

On Wednesday, IG Islamabad Aamir Zulfikar Khan also visited the victim family to assure that the culprits would be arrested soon as the police was investigating the matter on scientific basis. In his statement on the occasion, the IGP said that two teams had been constituted to investigate the matter. He asked the father of the victim to contact high police officers in case he wanted to help police in the investigation.

To a question, the IGP said that details about who was arrested so far in the case could not be shared with media but assured that the details would be shared once the police meet success in the case.

On the other side, according to the sources, the police have arrested 3 neighbours of Farishta as the investigation into the rape and murder of the minor girl continues. According to police sources, the daughter of one of the men was friends with the victim. According to police, one of the men arrested is a close relative of the 10-year-old Farista Mohmand. The police did not give more details regarding the case and said that they had widened the circle of their investigation.

Meanwhile, the district administration has also ordered inquiry into the incident.

LUCKNOW : An Indian teenager died after allegedly being set on fire during an attack by four men when she went outside to relieve herself in the country’s east, police said Monday.

The family of the girl, thought to have been 17, has told police she was attacked on Saturday night when she went outside because her home in Uttar Pradesh state - like many in India - does not have a toilet. The girl was from India’s lowest Dalit caste. She had earlier been harassed by the attackers for using a mobile phone which they thought was immoral, a police officer said. The girl had argued back against the men’s directive to stop using the phone, her family told police.

“The girl’s father has accused (a man called) Mukesh and three others of killing his daughter by setting her on fire when she had gone out to answer nature’s call,” said SP Akhilesh Chaurasiya.

The girl was taken to hospital but died on Sunday from injuries sustained in the attack in Auraiya village, 100 miles (160 kilometres) from the state capital Lucknow.

Chaurasiya told AFP that initial criminal cases have been registered against all four men, who also belong to the Dalit caste. The leader of the group has fled the village, he said.

Men hold great sway over life in India’s rural, dirt-poor villages where unmarried women are encouraged to follow strict rules in a perceived bid to protect their modesty.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said last month that India should strive to ensure every household has a toilet within the next four years.

Almost half of India’s population defecates outside, according to experts, leaving women in particular exposed not only to disease but also harassment and assault.

Unfortunately, bonded labor and feudalism have become the foundations of our political system. All the political forces have big land lords, businessmen and rich people in their ranks. They always protect their interests during making laws in parliament. So called labor laws have passed but there is no implementation. Slavery is also illegal in Pakistan.

https://nation.com.pk/03-Mar-2016/blasphemy-and-honor-two-peas-in-a-pod,2016-03-03 13:02:35+05:00,Blasphemy and honor: Two peas in a pod,"Share:

""Let us thank every good and noble man who stood so grandly, so proudly, in spite of opposition, of hatred and death, for what he believed to be the truth."" - Robert G. Ingersoll, The Liberty of Man, Woman and Child

During the last few days, blasphemy and honor killing, two different, yet closely related issues have been the centre of attention in Pakistan and among those interested in Pakistan. The reason as we know is that on 29th February Mumtaz Qadri was hanged, a bill that aims to protect women from violence was signed in Punjab and a Pakistan filmmaker won an Oscar for a movie that highlights the issue of honor killing.

Although the hanging of Qadri was by far the biggest of these events and also led to widespread mob violence and disruption in various cities of Pakistan, it is not hard to figure out that both blasphemy and honor killings are related to each other. And while more or less everyone condemns honor killing, there is a sizeable number of those among them who feel severe punishment including death is a justifiable punishment for blasphemy; and in my opinion this is the same as believing that honor killing is justified.

And if someone is still not sure what is the relationship between these two problems then the answer is Islam (or how Muslims practice it if you are unhappy at religion being blamed).

I am sure there will be many who will now jump up and scream this is not right for honor killing has got nothing to do with Islam or Muslims, well they should read this excellent study which shows that:

‘’Although Sikhs and Hindus do sometimes commit such murders, honor killings, both worldwide and in the West, are mainly Muslim-on-Muslim crimes. In this study, worldwide, 91 percent of perpetrators were Muslims. In North America, most killers (84 percent) were Muslims, with only a few Sikhs and even fewer Hindus perpetrating honor killings; in Europe, Muslims comprised an even larger majority at 96 percent while Sikhs were a tiny percentage. In Muslim countries, obviously almost all the perpetrators were Muslims. With only two exceptions, the victims were all members of the same religious group as their murderers.’’ Sindh reports 9 death, 888 new COVID-19 cases in last 24 hours

So we can see that for whatever the reasons, honor killing is predominantly a crime committed by Muslims, and in the same way only in Muslim countries is blasphemy a crime that is punishable by death.

We can therefore conclude that Muslims all over the world share some common trait that makes them demand death for blasphemy and kill their daughters in the name of honor. Question is what is this common factor?

Here we cannot blame religion directly, for while death for blasphemy clearly has a religious basis there is no command from any religious school of thought to kill your daughter or sister if you suspect her of tainting the family honor.

The clear agreement among all four Sunni religious schools as well as the Shia school that a blasphemer deserves nothing but death is rather strange for there is nothing in the Quran that would support any punishment let alone death for blasphemy.

In fact in my personal opinion those who believe that the punishment of death for blasphemy is justified are:

1. Refuting the basic teaching of their religion.

2. Refuting that Quran is the word of God.

3. Refuting the teachings of Mohammed.

4. Refuting the very existence of God!

How? Let me explain:

1. Recommending death for blasphemy refutes the basic teaching of Islam

Correct me if I am wrong but I think Islam recommends a punishment that equals the crime. So if someone slaps someone he should get a slap as the punishment; if someone blinds another he will be blinded and the ultimate crime, which is taking a life is punished by death.

However blasphemy does not fulfill any of these criteria. It does not harm even a hair on anyone's body, so how can the ultimate punishment be recommended for something that causes literally no physical harm at all? Clearly, this punishment is against the basic principles of Islam.

2. Recommending death for blasphemy refutes that Quran is the word of God

So if you believe in Quran it says that God tells you everything clearly. And if that is the case, to recommend the ultimate punishment, to ask that someone's life is to be taken there should be a clear command to do this in Quran. Well can someone knowledgeable about the Quran tell me where and which verse of Quran says that blasphemy should be punished by death?

Now here someone will come up with this answer, not everything is in Quran. For example where does Quran say how to perform namaz, but how can this be comparable. If someone performs namaz incorrectly and there are variations between various sects then should they be killed and what punishment will they get in afterlife? I think none. So how can you decide that you can take someone's life, the ultimate act of violence, without God clearly telling you that you can do it for blasphemy?

And therefore by insisting on such an ultimate punishment when it does not exist in Quran is rejecting Quran in my opinion.

3. Recommending death for blasphemy refutes the teachings of Mohammad

Again, please correct me if I am wrong but do we have any authentic reference that Mohammad ordered anyone to be killed for insulting him? Did he order anyone to be killed for insulting God? I don't think so. And therefore those who insist on this punishment are rejecting the teachings of Mohammad.

4. Recommending death for blasphemy refutes the very existence of God

We need to ask a question, why is there punishment for any crime? Why is there death punishment for murder?

The reasons are:

i) To provide justice to the victim and his/her loved ones. The next of kin of the one killed can feel that justice has been done and achieve some kind of closure that the killer has met the same fate, death. This does not apply in blasphemy for no one has been killed, so how can you provide justice by killing someone who has not killed anyone? Are you trying to provide justice to Mohammad and God? Don't you think both of them are above such petty insults?

ii) The second reason is deterrence. By killing a murderer you send out a message that if you take life your life will be taken from you. Whether it is an effective deterrence of not is arguable but theoretically it is deterrence. So what are you trying to prevent by killing blasphemers? Blasphemy does not kill anyone; so if you don't prevent murder by this then how can you justify it as deterrence?

And herein lies the logic that if you think that blasphemy is such a disliked crime in God's eyes then don't you think He will punish it as He feels appropriate on the Day of Judgment? You need to punish for crimes that harm others in this world to provide them justice or as deterrence, but for a crime that does not harm anyone in this world but those in the other world, shouldn't the punishment be left to the other world?

And the very reason people insist on death for blasphemy is that they actually don't believe in the existence of God. Although I am sure they have convinced themselves that they do, but they are only fooling themselves for if they did then they would leave God to punish those who insult him or his beloved Prophet Himself.

So how, one may ask, did the illogical and obviously un-Islamic practice of punishing and killing blasphemers become a part of mainline Islam? Here I feel the belief finds its roots in the same mind set that considers honor killing as justified. I will come back to this a bit later.

Analysts have given a long list of reasons for what leads someone to kill for honor ranging from preservation of economic assets to US drone attacks. But I feel besides explainable reasons there is a highly motivating and unexplainable pure sense of honor which induces people to commit this crime. In other words many who do kill in the name of honor are not doing it due to specific tangible reasons but out of a real sense of shame at their personal or family honor being tainted and believing that by the violence they will redeem what has been lost.

For whatever reasons, the sense of honor is very highly developed among the Muslims and Pakistanis.

I am told that a highly respected and enlightened Pakistan anchor had defended the attack on the office of a Paris magazine by tweeting that if the honor of my beloved Prophet is at stake then it is right to defend it by using violence. So once again the reason why Muslims and Pakistanis demand death for blasphemy is out of a real sense of honor, out of a need to use violence to defend or avenge their Prophet in the same way they do for their family honor.

In conclusion for me it is quite clear that both these phenomena peculiar to the Muslim world in general and Pakistan in specific have their basis in this false belief in honor which is part of the psyche of Muslims and Pakistanis. It is time we examine what is wrong with our societies which leads to this irrational and dangerous sense of false honor developing among our people and take steps to eliminate this error.

To do this we also need to develop among our so-called liberals the courage to see the truth. I use the term see rather than speak deliberately for many of our liberals are brainwashed to ignore the truth. I have seen them arguing that Taseer did not actually condemn the blasphemy law but the wrong use of this law, such statements are nothing but condoning Mumtaz Qadri. For, it means that if Taseer had actually condemned the blasphemy law he should have been punished. What needs to be clearly said is that there is no justification for severe punishment for criticizing current blasphemy laws in Pakistan, the argument that the law is correct but used incorrectly is ludicrous for it is illogical to have a law that can be misused so easily and no one with even a shred of humanity in him/her can demand that anyone should be killed for insulting another person or book. It is strange that those who are disgusted by honor killings yet feel severe punishment for blasphemy is justified fail to see that they are accepting as legitimate a crime which is even worse than the crime of honor killing.",['Aamir Butt'],"And while more or less everyone condemns honor killing, there is a sizeable number of those among them who feel severe punishment including death is a justifiable punishment for blasphemy; and in my opinion this is the same as believing that honor killing is justified.

The girl, however, did not return which concerned her parents greatly and they along with the other family members searched her everywhere the whole day and night but in vain.

The family dialled the police and complained about the incident, saying that the accused had killed their girl after sexual abuse and kept her stuffed in a closet to conceal the crime.

Laisar Kalan police reached the spot, took the body into custody and shifted it to Tehsil Headquarters Hospital for post-mortem.

The police registered a case (No 39/2018) under sections 201 and 302 PPC against suspects including Iqbal, his two sons Qaisar Ali and Yasir Ali and three female members of the family. The police also arrested Yasir, Qaisar and the three women present at the house while Iqbal managed to flee away.

The initial autopsy reports confirmed that Zainab was murdered after rape. The DNA samples had been collected from the crime scene and were sent to Lahore for forensic examination.

The incident sent a wave of shock and fear among the residents of the area. Narowal District Police Officer Imran Kishor urged the people to keep a close eye on their surroundings to avoid such horrendous incidents.

Later, the police handed over the girl's body to the family for burial after medico legal formalities. The ill-fated girl was laid to rest in her native graveyard amidst sobs and tears. A large number of the people attended her funeral. The bereaved parents sought justice from Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

Berlin-An independent study commissioned by the Roman Catholic Church uncovered hundreds of cases of sexual violence allegedly committed by clergy and laymen in Germany’s top diocese, its authors said Thursday. The long-awaited 800-page report on the Cologne diocese found 202 alleged perpetrators of sexual assault and 314 victims between 1975 and 2018, Bjoern Gercke, a lawyer mandated by the Church, told reporters.

“More than half of the victims were children under the age of 14,” Gercke said.

However, the investigation cleared Cologne’s Archbishop Rainer Maria Woelki, a conservative who has long resisted reform, of breach of duty over the abuse.

‘Tragedy of Cologne’

Woelki had faced months of protests for refusing to allow the publication of an earlier study on abuse committed by priests in his diocese.

He had justified his decision by citing a right to privacy of the alleged perpetrators accused in the report, carried out by a Munich law firm, and what he called a lack of independence on the part of some researchers.

His approach was branded “a disaster” as recently as late February by Georg Baetzing, president of the German bishops’ conference.

In the wake of Thursday’s damning report, Woelki said he was suspending two Cologne Church officials, bishop Dominikus Schwaderlapp and the head of a diocese court, Guenter Assenmacher, with immediate effect, citing a “cover-up” of abuse cases.",[],"Share:Berlin-An independent study commissioned by the Roman Catholic Church uncovered hundreds of cases of sexual violence allegedly committed by clergy and laymen in Germany’s top diocese, its authors said Thursday.

LONDON - Girls are more likely to be married off before their eighteenth birthday than enroll in secondary school in an “alarming” 26 countries, a global charity said on Friday. Niger, where 76 percent of girls marry before they turn 18 and only 10 percent enroll in secondary school, topped the list compiled by CARE International, followed by Chad, Central African Republic, South Sudan and Somalia. “Girls shouldn’t be walking down the aisle in greater numbers than into secondary school classrooms,” Helen Pankhurst of CARE International said in a statement. “Every time a girl under 18 is forced into a marriage or prevented from attending school, it’s a missed opportunity to improve that girl’s life and strike at the roots of poverty.” Child marriage deprives girls of education and opportunities and puts them at risk of serious injury or death if they have children before their bodies are ready.

They are also more vulnerable to domestic and sexual violence. Although many countries have closed the gender gap in primary education, they still have significant gaps when it comes to secondary education, said CARE in a report published ahead of International Day of the Girl Child. Each day about 39,000 girls worldwide are forced to marry, said CARE, citing United Nations figures. Meanwhile, 62 million girls are not in school, half of them adolescents. Some of the underlying causes of child marriage, such as poverty and gender discrimination, apply across countries. Others are more localised, like trafficking of girls in Mauritania, dowry considerations in Bangladesh or conflicts in Afghanistan and Mali, CARE said. In June, the U.N. Human Rights Council adopted a resolution calling for an end to child, early and forced marriage, and recognising child marriage as a violation of human rights.

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has released new guidelines for Muslims in the country with the aim of prohibiting dowries and extravagant marriages after a woman recently committed suicide due to “dowry harassment.”

The guidelines are contained in a document released for Muslims to be signed and followed. The AIMPLB is widely regarded in India as the representative of Muslims in the country.

The 11-point guidelines were released by AIMPLB Chairman Maulana Rabe Hasan Nadvi recently.

Nadvi has urged all members of the Muslim community to shun the dowry system and lavish spending during wedding ceremonies.

The move comes after a Muslim girl from Gujarat committed suicide last month by drowning herself over dowry harassment, in which her husband and in-laws physically abused her for the dowry. The suicide set off a countrywide debate over social evils associated with marriage among Muslims.

The board has already launched a 10-day drive to educate members of the community across the country and to raise awareness against such evils. During the campaign, Muslim clerics will place emphasis on solemnizing marriages according to Islamic customs to eradicate dowries and overspending during marriage functions.

The new guidelines allow only simple wedding ceremonies, ban dowries and do not permit traditions such as wedding processions, fireworks, dancing and lavish feasts, as it calls them un-Islamic. It only allows Dawat-e-Walima, a feast served after wedding rituals are completed by the groom’s family in which invitations are also extended to poor and needy people of the community.

Many un-Islamic rituals have ended

Maulana Umrain Mahfooz Rahmani, secretary of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said it is not right to say that measures to end social evils like dowries are being taken suddenly.

“The Muslim Personal Law Board has been working for years to bring about good changes in society and motivates Muslims to end bad practices and customs. As far as marriage is concerned, work has been done on it for years so that the evil practices that have become associated with it could be curbed,” he told Anadolu Agency.

Previously, marriages were rarely solemnized in mosques. But now a good change is taking place and a large number of marriages are being performed in mosques and many un-Islamic rituals have ended, said Rahmani.

He said that despite many good changes, the painful aspect is that many poor girls still stay unmarried as their families are unable to spend a lot of money.

“There are many others who are suffering even after marriage as the dowry demand continues and the girl’s husband and his family keep pressuring her to bring more dowries. Many girls commit suicide as they are unable to bear the physical and mental harassment. To end all these things, a new guideline has been made and it is being worked on all over the country.

“Members of the Personal Law Board are in the entire country. Among them are well-known Muslims from a cross section of Indian Muslim society such as religious leaders, lawyers, politicians, scholars and other professionals. They have been asked to work on this in their respective areas. Meetings of imams [clerics] of mosques are being held all over the country,” he added.

Similarly, members of the Islah E Muasharah (Reforms of Society) Committee of the board have also been asked to discuss this issue and take action so that more and more people can be made aware. In most areas of the country, discussions are taking place and the common people are participating in debates.

“Even in the mosques, the clerics are talking with the people. During the last three Fridays, discussions and arguments took place in the mosques after the Friday prayers and the harms of the dowry system and mega wedding ceremonies were explained to the people. People visiting the mosques for offering namaz [prayers] are being told to avoid dowries and extravagance,” said Rahmani.

Zafaryab Jilani, a member of the Muslim Personal Law Board, said marriage is a contract.

“Our effort is to make nikah [marriage] easy and simple for the people.”

“We want them to avoid spending money unnecessarily in marriage so that they can present a good example before society. The board has always tried this and will continue to do so,” said Jilani.",[],"Nadvi has urged all members of the Muslim community to shun the dowry system and lavish spending during wedding ceremonies.

LAHORE - Sheikhupura Regional Police Officer (RPO) Zulfikar Ahmed Cheema has revealed that the five victims of a gang-rape have identified the culprits during the ‘identification-parade’, while all the required evidences have also been collected to bring the criminals to justice.

“The DNA test of the accused has also proved that the same criminals had assaulted the five girls,” the DIG told reporters on Monday. The police did not leave any stone unturned to ensure justice in this case, said the DIG, who is personally supervising the investigations of the case.

In November last year, some influential men in the limits of Narangmandi police in the Sheikhupura district had raped five girls including daughter and nieces of a poor worker.

On this occasion, the parents of the girls expressed their reservations stating that the criminals were influential and well-off in the area and some quarters were backing the rapists. The regional police officer warned that the police would also ensure strict action against the supporters and backers of the criminals, no matter how powerful and influential they are. “Let me clear, the elements found involved in backing the rapists would also be arrested and punished as per law. The police will utilise all the resources and energies to ensure rigorous punishment to the culprits,” Zulfikar Cheema warned.

The RPO also informed that the police had completed the investigations in professional way by using scientific methods as well and the services of senior lawyers are also hired to pursue the case in the court of law to get the rapists punished.

The police officer hoped that following the pattern of lawyers’ community in New Delhi in India, the legal fraternity would never represent the rapists. In India, the lawyers unanimously refused to represent the accused, who had gang-raped a girl in the moving bus, prompting countrywide protests.

According to a press statement issued on Monday, Sheikhupura District Bar President Rana Saif Ullah and General Secretary Tahir Shehzad announced their support for the victim girls. They also said that they would represent the innocent girls rather than the criminals in the court.

Various civil society organisations and political activists have also announced their support for the poor girls. The parents of the girls appreciated the police team which carried out raids and arrested the culprits in days. According to Sheikhupura district police officer, Rana Abdul Jabber, all the eight accused had been sent to the jail after proper investigations. The accused were identified as Sajjad alias Shahzad, Tassaddaq alias Mara, Aqeel Atif, Nawaz alias Noori, Ali Raza, Mohsin Raza, Nawaz alias Lala, and Zaheer Ahmed.

The Narangmandi police had registered the case (FIR No 534/12 under section 376/B and 365/B of the PPC) against eight nominated accused. The court had ordered the medical examination of the ill-fated girls.

Reportedly, influential landlords Mara Jutt and Zaheer Jutt along with their accomplices had tied Muhammad Boota and his wife with ropes. They abducted and ultimately gang-raped the daughter and four nieces of the poor labourer on November 23, 2012.

Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif had visited the house of the victim girls in Muridke and announced that he would ensure that rigorous punishment was given to the culprits involved in gang-raping five innocent girls.

Hailing from Kohistan, KPK, Afzal Kohistan rose to prominence in 2012 when he bravely went against the customs of his area to bring a case of “honor” killing to the national attention. In 2011, a video of his two brothers dancing to the songs and clapping of four women went viral in the village and came to the attention of a local Jirga. Afzal alleged that the four women in the video had been killed by their families on the orders of the Jirga and his brothers went into hiding to save their lives. When a fact finding mission was sent by Chief Justice to probe into the matter, two girls were shown to them with claims that they were the ones seen in the video. However, Afzal and one of the members of the mission, Dr. Farzana Bari contested these claims. Later, a report from the digital lab of United Kingdom proved that the girls presented to the commission only had 14 and 40 percent face resemblance with the girls seen in the video. It was only seven years later in 2018 that the Police finally registered an FIR of the alleged honor killing. In the meanwhile, this whistleblowing had also jeopardized the lives of Afzal and his family. Three of his older brothers were killed in 2013 and his house was burnt. Rest of the family members had to leave the village and hide in an unknown location to avoid a similar fate. Despite all these tribulations, Afzal refused to back down and continued fighting the case in the courts. He was also killed in March this year in Abbottabad.

Should we be worried about why a normal video of men, women singing, dancing has led to so many deaths?

Zainab’s case has proved to be a catalyst for exposing many other cases of child abuse. The question is- is the state responding with as much urgency as the occurrences of these instances?

The National Assembly (NA) on Friday passed a resolution to form a 10-member special committee to look into child abuse cases for curbing such crimes by making full use of legal remedies, effective investigation and speedy prosecution.

On the same day that the NA formed the committee, two more cases of child sexual abuse and abduction were reported in Dir and Hafizabad. As the unceasing line of new such cases are showing, the problem has always been there, we are just paying attention to it more.

The depth of this issue bellies the meager efforts of a small committee of the NA with the vague task of “looking into child abuse cases”. Tackling this problem requires fundamental changes with how we police such cases, how we use medical and DNA testing in a reliable - and sensitive - manner, how we prosecute and punish offenders, and how we create preventive measures in society. The NA body - while a good initiative - however is merely conducting executive oversight on the investigations into the child abuse cases, not looking at ways to fix the system.

The shadow of the Kasur child abuse victims have harboured over this case, reminding us how easy it is to raise outcry, and then forget about the issue. The uproar over the Zainab case, too, will die away once a few high-profile cases are closed, but the same mechanisms will remain. This is why the NA needs to deploy more of its resources to tackle this problem; task the law ministry with the job of suggesting legislation, reach out to stakeholders - such as NGOs - which have already compiled extensive reform proposals and engage the MNAs into debate that leads to legislation. A measly ad-hoc committee without many powers is not going to cut it.

Zainab’s brutal rape and murder was not a rarity of cases; it was the factor that deflected light on the prevailing instances of child sexual abuse in the country. NGOs estimate almost eleven children are sexually abused in Pakistan every day; our NA needs to implement some deep-rooted reforms to challenge the abusive culture that prevails in our legal system which allows this abuse to happen- or else, Zainab too will become just another statistic.",[],"Share:Zainab’s case has proved to be a catalyst for exposing many other cases of child abuse.

ISLAMABAD – Youm-e-Wisaal of Ummul Momineen Hazrat Khadija tul Kubra (RA) will be observed on Monday throughout the country as International Youm Al-Huzn with religious spirit, devotion and respect.

The great Muslim lady Hazrat Khadijah (RA) passed away on 10th Ramadhan in the tenth year of Hijrah, 620 CE, at the age of 65.

Her death was a great loss to the Prophet (SAW). The Holy Prophet (SAW) was grieved to the extent that he declared the year of death of Hazrat Abu Talib (A.S.) and Hazrat Khadija (RA) as Aam- ul-Huzn i.e. the year of mourning.

Sayyiduna Rasoolullah’s (SAW) marriage with Sayyidah Khadija Radi Allahu Ta’ala Anha took place about fifteen years before the beginning of the Revelation, he being 25, and she was 40. She was a rich widow and ran a large trade of her own. It was she who offered herself in marriage to the Holy Prophet Muhammad (SAW) who was associated with her in trading ventures. From the time of her marriage with the Holy Prophet till her death, over a period of twenty years, she gave her husband ease of circumstances, and deep love and devotion.

“She believed in me when none else did. She embraced Islam when people disbelieved me. And she helped and comforted me when there was none else to lend me a helping hand.”

“Never was I jealous of any of the Prophet’s wives”, said Sayyidah Ayesha Radi ALLAH Ta’ala Anha, “but Khadija, although I never saw her. Her sweet memory never blurred in the Prophet’s heart.

Once I hurt his feelings on this issue and he replied gravely, ‘Allah SubHanuhu wa Ta’ala has blessed me with her love.’

Sayyiduna Khadija (RA) bore the Beloved Habeeb SallAllaho Alaihi wa Sallam six children, the first born was named Sayyiduna Qaasim Radi ALLAHu Ta’ala Anho, after whom, according to Arab custom, the Holy Prophet SallAllaho Alaihi wa Sallam received the Kunya “Abul Qaasim” or “the father of Qaasim”. Then were born Sayyiduna Abdullah Radi ALLAHu Ta’ala Anha Anhum Ajmaa’een. All of them passed away in their infancy. Amongst the daughters Sayyidah Ruqayya Radi ALLAHu Ta’ala Anha was the eldest, then came Sayyidah Zaynab Radi ALLAHu Ta’ala Anha, Sayyidah Umm Kulthoom Radi ALLAHu Ta’ala Anha and the last and best known of them was Sayyidah Faatima Radi ALLAHu Ta’ala Anha.

In the absence of this Bibis sacrifices, Islam would not have achieved its fanfare. Hazrat Khadija was born in Makka. She was the daughter of Khuwayled bin Asad bin Abdul Uzza bin Qusayy. Qusayy was the common progenitor of her line as well as the line of Muhammed Mustafa of the clan of Bani Hashim, and the future Prophet of Islam. She thus belonged to a collateral branch of the Bani Hashim. Next to Bani Hashim itself, her family was the noblest and the most honorable in all Arabia. Her family was distinguished not only by its opulence but also by the content of its character. Khadija’s mother had died in or around AD. 575; and Khuwayled, her father, died in or around A.D. 585. Upon his death, his children inherited his fortune, and divided it among themselves. Wealth has its own perils. It can tempt one to live a life of idleness and luxury. There are four women who enjoy supremacy over other women and one of the great personalities out ofthem is Hazrat Khadija tul Kubra (S.A.) on whose honour and supremacy an Ayah of Holy Quran stand witness that says: Rasool, We found you poor, then we made you wealthy.

Khadija tul Kubra (R A) was great Mohsina-e-Islam on which Quran also stands witness.

This great woman has the honour of being the first Musaddiqa-e-Paighambar (SAAW), her wealth and sacrifices of her offspring helped Islam to a great extent as she utilised all her wealth all around to dissemination of Islam.

He said Hazrat Khadijas (R.A.) home had become a shelter not only for Rasool (SAAW) but for all Muslims. Hazrat Khadija tul Kubra (RA) had been the protector and defender of Paigham-e-Risalat in the initial and most difficult era of Islam. The Seerat-e-Khadija (RA) is the beacon of light for women at large in every era. Before

Islam, Khadija was the Princess of Makka. When the sun of Islam rose above the horizon, Allah was pleased to make her the Princess of Islam also. Allah was also pleased to make her the Mother of the Believers, as He says in His Book: The support that Khadija gave to the Muslim community in Makka, was indispensable for the survival of Islam. Her support to the Muslim community guaranteed its survival when it was in a state of blockade. In this sense, she was a maker of history -the history of Islam.",[],"Share:ISLAMABAD – Youm-e-Wisaal of Ummul Momineen Hazrat Khadija tul Kubra (RA) will be observed on Monday throughout the country as International Youm Al-Huzn with religious spirit, devotion and respect.

https://nation.com.pk/19-Oct-2017/metoo,2017-10-18 23:40:30+05:00,MeToo,"Share:

In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein allegations, Alyssa Milano, of Who’s the Boss and Charmed fame, started a #MeToo, social media campaign that has flooded Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The campaign aims to illustrate the prevalence of sexual harassment and sexual assault, and has clearly succeeded in the endeavour. Within just two days the campaign has successfully revealed the sheer magnitude of sexual violence. Milano’s campaign has received 80,000 responses, women, some men and members of the Trans community are participating in the campaign from all across the world.

The numbers are overwhelming, the stories are horrifying and the support is moving. But what else are we learning from this campaign?

Stories of sexual harassment and assault cut across industry, geographical locations, class, age, gender and marital status. The campaign may have started in response to predators in the U.S entertainment industry, but is definitely not restricted to it. In the local context, there are numerous stories surrounding the Lollywood industry and famous cricketers none of which have gained significant media attention nor inspired legal action. In the political realm, PTI leader Imran Khan has been accused of sexual harassment by Ayesha Gulalai Wazir and former PM Nawaz Sharif has been accused of sexual advances towards Kim Barker; both of which have been dismissed as ‘attention seeking’. Professors from LUMS, Karachi University and Punjab University have been accused sexual harassment, all of which have been settled within university affairs. The list goes on.

The volume of people participating in the campaign is large. The trend has caught fire because people feel empowered by sharing their stories. They have control over their narrative, they can choose to reveal as much or as little as they want, and are not forced to identify their abuser. People are allowed to define sexual assault in personal terms, and are not required to sanitize their language using legal or political jargon. As the assaults are not always directly described, mostly participants have been not gas-lighted nor trolled. There is a perceived safety in numbers, a common thread connecting all participants in solidarity. While all these conditions have contributed to the success of the social media campaign, it is depressing to realize that had all these conditions not be prevalent, the campaign would not have gained traction. In different circumstances participants of the campaign would have fallen prey to social media trolls and victim blamers.

However, the volume of people participating in the campaign can also be perceived as small. As with all cases of sexual violence there is a huge discrepancy between reported violence and actual violence. Revealing experiences of sexual assault and harassment on a public platform comes at a high price for many. Historically members of the LGBT community are less likely to report violence because it invites more violence, cyber bullying and therefore, psychological harm. Victims of sexual violence may be in intimate relationships with their abuser. Abusers may be in a position of power at home and in the workplace, and therefore in a position to punish the victim. Even well intentioned loved ones can add to the victims’ disempowerment but clumsily and persistently asking unwelcomed questions. In a hasty attempt to protect victims, near and dear could curtail the victim’s agency by imposing curfews, insisting that they quit their jobs and disallowing to independent access to public spaces. If one were to learn anything from this, is that participating in the #MeToo campaign is not case of jumping on the band wagon, but a deliberate and calculated move.

#MeToo is not the first of its kind. Other social media campaigns include #YesAllWomen and #EverydaySexism, both of which are run predominantly by women aiming to educate men about sexism and harassment. While acknowledging the power of social media campaigns, one can’t help but question the limits of its impact. It seems that women (and other victims) have to not only protect themselves, recover from abuse but also bear the burden of educating men. How many stories, how many campaigns will it take for men to believe us? Will the onus of preventing sexual harassment and assault ever fall on men?

I saw another Facebook post today, one that didn’t gain as much traction. It said “A heartfelt request to men: in the comments of this post please list one tangible action that you will take to end rape culture. (We know many of you are victims too, we believe you. But we still can’t solve this problem without you.)” – by Audra Williams.

Perhaps this should be the next social media campaign.",['Maheen Saeed'],"Share:In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein allegations, Alyssa Milano, of Who’s the Boss and Charmed fame, started a #MeToo, social media campaign that has flooded Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
The campaign aims to illustrate the prevalence of sexual harassment and sexual assault, and has clearly succeeded in the endeavour.
Professors from LUMS, Karachi University and Punjab University have been accused sexual harassment, all of which have been settled within university affairs.
As with all cases of sexual violence there is a huge discrepancy between reported violence and actual violence.
If one were to learn anything from this, is that participating in the #MeToo campaign is not case of jumping on the band wagon, but a deliberate and calculated move.","['campaign', 'sexual', 'assault', 'men', 'violence', 'metoo', 'participating', 'media', 'harassment', 'victims', 'social']","{'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/rsss.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/android_app_on_play_logo_small.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/g_plus.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/linkedin_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2017-10-18/withdraw-taxes-on-dipers-you-too-will-need-them-soon-1508352274-7660.jpg', 'https://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619912693.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png?date=2019-02-15', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/twitter.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_publishrr.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2017-10-18/and-that-means-lahore-roads-will-again-remain-closed-for-at-least-three-days-more-panic-sri-lanka-to-play-one-t20-in-lahore-1508352297-5740.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/utube.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/uploads/theme/logo-1550475639.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619902433.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/whatsapp_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/facebook.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/app-store.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png'}",True,https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg,1,,,,,nation

British schools were urged to act to protect girls at risk of being taken abroad for marriage during the summer holidays after government figures released on Thursday showed nearly a third of reports of possible forced marriage involved children.

The warning came a day after a mother went on trial in Birmingham accused of tricking her teenage daughter into traveling to Pakistan to marry a much older man to whom she was allegedly betrothed when she was 13.

Campaigners said the case could lead to the country’s first conviction for forced marriage.

Data released by the government’s Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) on Thursday showed it received reports of 1,196 possible cases last year.

Although the figure was 19 per cent down on 2016, it said the drop did not represent a decrease in the prevalence of forced marriage which remained a “hidden crime”.

Nearly a third of cases involved people under 18 - the definition of child marriage. In 15 per cent of cases, the victim was under 16 - the youngest was just two.

More than a third of cases related to Pakistan and more than 10 per cent to Bangladesh.

The biggest change was the rise in reports linked to Somalia, which had doubled since 2016. A fifth of cases overall concerned male victims.

Karma Nirvana, a charity which campaigns against forced marriage, said it had seen a sharp increase in calls to its own helpline.

Charity founder Jasvinder Sanghera said it was alarming that so many cases reported to the FMU involved children and called for schools to take action.

“In Britain today there are children in our classrooms who are either engaged ... at risk of forced marriage or have been forced into marriage,” she said.

“Families will use the summer holidays as an opportunity to take their kids abroad to enter into marriages or engagements - so what are we doing to ensure schools are engaged?”

Sanghera said she had recently met education chiefs to discuss the issue.

“There is still an attitude out there that (schools) don’t see it as a safeguarding issue, but as a cultural issue. They don’t ... want to offend parents,” she added.

Forced marriage is illegal under British law, even if carried out abroad.

The unit could not immediately say if it had referred any cases to police.

“The law is futile if we don’t use it,” Sanghera said. “Many people in Britain, and certainly the victims, don’t even know the law exists.”",[],"Campaigners said the case could lead to the country’s first conviction for forced marriage.

ISLAMABAD - A three-member probe committee at Quaid-e-Azam University (QAU) has started hearing sexual harassment accusations made by a female student against her department in-charge but in the eyes of the media he has been already proven guilty.

Ajmal Waheed, the in-charge of Quaid-e-Azam School of Management Sciences (QASMS), said he is near to his retirement and it is for the first time in his 30 years career that a student who visited him twice in his office since her enrolment alleged such malicious charges against him.

Seeing her academic record and demands to withdraw cheating case against her and help her get passed in a subject, he had sensed that she may make any charges so he asked her subordinates to remain present in the office whenever she visited him, said Waheed. The day when alleged assault took place, technical assistant of the school Muhammad Imran was present and many other students were gathered in the adjacent room, the door of which opens into in-charge's room to get information about Prime Minister's laptop scheme, he said.

He maintains that in total strength of 750 of the school around 40 per cent are girls and he has supervised nearly 20 female students. ""They may complain about my strictness and other issues but no one levelled such allegations. And the way print and social media exaggerated the issue without any investigation and continued mudslinging, my damaged reputation would not restore even if the committee declares me innocent,"" he regretted.

The student denies that she cheated in exams of MBA 5th semester. She says the case was fabricated and the in-charge of school manipulated all the teachers to damage her academic record. She alleges when she visited his office to get his approval to rectify a mistake in marks of a subject he uttered some indecent remarks and demands. On hearing such remarks she got panic and ran away from the room and her shawl was left there.

But the administration staff and a professor who visited the in-charge at that time, however, viewed that the shawl gave them a feeling as if someone has deliberately put it on the chair to make a case.

There is another background of this issue that has been ignored, informed another professor of the school who wished anonymity. ""An inquiry against her for using unfair means in the exam was already going on and a disciplinary case was also under investigation against her class fellow who threatened the in-charge to take back the cheating case against her,"" he said.

The way application was written, moved and disseminated to media and social media systematically, it seems that the students are being used by other groups for their vested interests without thinking about the future of the students. They have headed towards the point of no return and don't know what they are trying to achieve, he remarked.

The teacher says that she used to work hard but business management was not her field. ""She was already on probation and in the 5th semester due to cheating case, wrong registration of a subject and failing to clear another subject she might be dropped out.""

The students are dissatisfied with university investigations and committee. But the administration says the case has been referred to an inquiry committee that was already probing another harassment case. ""Committee can't be made on the wishes of the accused and the victim. The committee was formed a few months ago after dissolution of the anti-harassment committee that will decide the case under efficiency and discipline rules as the university has been asked by the President Office that harassment act does not apply on educational institutions,"" informed QAU Vice Chancellor Dr Etazaz Ahmad.

Because of good repute of school in-charge and his rigorousness many teaching faculty members and students believe that the case is fake. ""It's become very easy to level such allegations and get away with all your past faults."" said a professor of Earth Science Department refusing to comment on record.

""Though in male dominated society there is harassment at every level yet a few reported cases are fake too. If a student comes to my room, goes back and says that I said some indecent things to her, I can't prove it wrong. And until it is proven wrong I will continue to be considered guilty by all. Now the teaching faculty has become so careful that they refuse to meet any student in their office to avoid such allegations,"" he opined.

Gender experts maintain that it does not matter whether someone enjoys a good repute or not in such cases and the past record of the students cannot be overlooked either. ""Sexual harassment does exist and it can be of various forms. Wherever power dynamics exist, such cases appear. As mostly men occupy managerial positions, women are mostly victims of harassment but it can be vice versa too,"" says Fatima Ihsan, faculty member of Gender Studies Centre, QAU.

Although by and large students are disrespected by teachers and officials in the administration and females feel unsafe in the campus yet there have been some false accusations as well, said Professor Dr Qaiser Mushtaq, former dean and syndicate member and chairman of anti-harassment committee.

He as a chairman of the committee probed four harassment cases and of them the decision of two cases was implemented by the administration.

There is a gender bias at the campus and almost all the students are frightened of the teachers' wrath. But, according to him, at least in three cases both parties were involved initially and the complaints were moved by either of the parties due to vested interests. The university administration also took the opportunity to twist arms for settling scores or for establishing it 'writ'.

'In the complaints the statements are contrasting and inadequate and biased information is provided. Politics comes in and the lobbyists start protecting their sides'. He found that strangely in most cases the students had poor academic performance and the complaints were either due to grievances of the students to take advantage. Sometimes, the university also digs out cases to punish the 'disliked' ones.

Such cases are appearing in every organisation including universities but somehow the cases in QAU are leaked to the media, said Maliha Hussain of Mehergarh, a nongovernmental organisation that has been leading the passage and the implementation of the law.

Maliha, who has been involved in resolving 3000 cases of harassment in the country, said the law can be misused like any other law and people spend their whole lives in jails on false accusations. Women can also misuse it but it does not mean it should be repealed, she said.

She said the protection against harassment of women at the workplace act, 2010 fully covers students and educational institutes and an official of the university who was proven guilty was pardoned by the then president on the advice of ministry of law that was sentenced without thoroughly reading the law.

She said the cases should be investigated carefully by trained committees to give justice to the real victims and the cases of false accusations should be referred to ombudsperson for any action.",['Asma Ghani'],"She says the case was fabricated and the in-charge of school manipulated all the teachers to damage her academic record.

Honor killing has been, and continues to be, a bane of the sub-continental society.Yet, until the recent past when the human rights movements finally shifted their focus to the malaise, it was rarely ever highlighted. This scourge was inherited by Pakistan from its very inception, and the decay has persisted till date.

In 2012, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan noted in its annual report that, “at least 943 women were killed in the name of honor, of which 93 were minors”.But despite the raging debate and the reformation in laws, curtailment of the crime continues to prove to be a herculean task.

The mensrea behind this perverse act could be the assuagement of inflated egos, and it is commonly committed in the rural and backward areas of the country as a punishment for the ‘disrepute that the act of marrying a person of choice brings to the family’. Take for instance, the inhumane incident in Chakwal, wherein a brother brutally killed his sister by the repeated blows of the dagger, for having married of her own free will.

This stems from the patriarchal mindset that pervades the Pakistani society, wherein the leader of the house is trained to be a ruler and his housemates as his subjects; as opposed to being made a role model and a friend of all members. This inherent fault in the upbringing, traditions, and the spillover effect of the same into the education system of the country manifests itself in the form of honor killing.

The discrimination that the girls are subjected to while growing up, by granting priority to the boys, inculcates a sense of superiority in the boys, who then start acting as the Gods of another’s life. Thus, where the retaliation and resistance is shown by the girl, be it in such fundamental choice as choosing the man she would spend the rest of her life with, extreme violence becomes her fate.

These failings of the society are then projected onto the religion of the majority and onto the country itself, thereby, giving a bad name to it in the world.

This is despite the fact that Islam ordains restraint in reacting to allegations and mere aspersions.

According to a hadees, Hazrat Saad Bin Uabadah asked the Prophet (P.B.U.H.),“if a person finds a man with his wife, shall it be lawful for him to kill that man?” The Prophet (P.B.U.H.) replied: 'No'.

In another hadith on another occasion, HazratSaad Bin Uabadah asked the Prophet (P.B.U.H.),“If I find a man with my wife should I wait till I bring forth four witnesses?”. The Prophet (P.B.U.H.) replied,“Yes”.

This means that until and unless sexual activity is proved, one must not act upon allegations.

Moreover, Islam does not bar a woman from choosing a husband of her own choice. Au contraire, it provides that a ‘Nikah’ should not be solemnized if a woman disagrees with the prospect. This is exactly the rationale behind asking the woman thrice if she agrees to the marriage, before the same is affirmed.

The marriage by choice, unfortunately in the Muslim societies, has become analogous to illicit sexual relations, and using the Quranic wisdom which explicitly proscribes adultery, the punishment becomes a fate of the marrying subjects. However, the Quranic verse (24:2) which asserts that: “the woman and the man guilty of adultery flog each of them with a hundred strips, let not compassion move you in their case in a matter prescribed by Allah, if you believe in Allah and the last day; and let a party of believers witness their punishment” can be distinguished on multiple grounds. Foremost, the verse prescribes the punishment in equal measure for both the girls and the boys; secondly, the punishment is for a crime of adultery and not for choosing to marry of accord; thirdly, the prescribed punishment is that of flogging and not execution; and lastly, the said punishment has to be enforced through the state, and vigilante justice may not be condoned in any circumstances.

The last one vindicates that Islam posits perpetually upholding the state sovereignty, and dissuades an individual from taking law in own hands. Individuals cannot, under any circumstances, be allowed to create chaos.

Although the laws are being reformed, the need is to metamorphose the society’s paradigm, and this feat cannot be achieved by unilateral state efforts. Every person would have to play his part, and educational system of the country would have to be transformed. The society would have to be remodeled from the grass root level, so that the gender inequality is stemmed. This, only, can alleviate the state from the affliction of honor killing.",['Saba Zubair'],"),“if a person finds a man with his wife, shall it be lawful for him to kill that man?” The Prophet (P.B.U.H.)
Moreover, Islam does not bar a woman from choosing a husband of her own choice.

JAKARTA : A 12-year-old boy is the sole survivor of a plane crash that killed eight people in mountainous eastern Indonesia, authorities said Sunday.

The Swiss-made Pilatus aircraft lost contact with air traffic control Saturday during what was supposed to be a flight of around 40 minutes in remote Papua province. The wreckage of the plane was found in a heavily forested area on a mountain side in the Oksibil subdistrict on Sunday morning. ""Eight passengers were found dead and one was found alive,"" Papua military spokesman Lieutenant colonel Dax Sianturi said.

""At the moment the cause of the crash has not been confirmed,"" he told AFP, adding an investigation would be carried out by the national transportation safety committee.

The plane, which was owned by private charter company Dimonim Air, was carrying seven passengers and two crew.

Before the accident, villagers in nearby Okatem reported hearing a loud roar followed by an explosion.

Search and rescue teams walked two hours to reach the crash site and were still recovering the bodies late morning.

Indonesia relies heavily on air transport to connect its thousands of islands but has a poor aviation safety record and has suffered several fatal crashes in recent years.

Papua is a particularly difficult area to reach.

Five people died after a small plane crashed near Wamena in Papua province in July last year.

In August 2015, a commercial passenger aircraft operated by Indonesian carrier Trigana crashed in Papua due to bad weather, killing all 54 people on board.",[],"Share:JAKARTA : A 12-year-old boy is the sole survivor of a plane crash that killed eight people in mountainous eastern Indonesia, authorities said Sunday.

LAHORE: Ninety percent women face harassment on public transport and 82 percent at bus stops.

Most of the women commuters attempt to downplay such incidents and do not report them due to patriarchal socio-cultural patterns that complaints will not be acted on, stated a report titled ‘Women's Safety Audit in Public Transport in Lahore’ conducted by Aurat Foundation.

The study was conducted by Aurat Foundation and co-led by the Women’s Development Department (WDD) Punjab and UN Women, in collaboration with the Punjab Commission on the Status of Women (PCSW), the Chief Minister’s Strategic Reform Unit and the Punjab Safe City Project (PSCP).

According to the report, the most common types of sexual harassment at bus stops include staring, stalking, obscene gestures, whistling, passing sexual comments, and touching.

The study assessed the safety concerns of women and girls using public transport in Lahore.

Focusing on the bus services provided by the Lahore Transport Company (LTC) and Metro Bus, it includes a detailed desk review, a perception study with 903 women commuters and 100 bus drivers and conductors, key informant interviews, safety walk evaluations at selected bus stops, and focus group discussions.

The data reveals an alarming situation regarding the safety of women on public transport.

According to the research, finding a situation contributing to existing restrictions on women’s mobility, limiting their opportunities to engage in economic activity, education and other aspects of a fulfilled life.

There is no sex-disaggregated data on women using public transport.

There is limited use of travel cards by women and 79 percent of women and girls traveling on the Metro bus service do not possess travel cards.

There are significant safety concerns at bus stops and 82 percent of women commuters report facing harassment at bus stops, with higher rates at LTC bus stops compared to Metro bus stations, targeting mainly younger women (20–29 years of age).

There are significant safety concerns on buses and 90 percent of women report experiencing sexual harassment on buses with a higher ratio on LTC buses.

The main types of sexual harassment include passing sexual comments, staring, pushing and inappropriate touching.

The perpetrators are primarily fellow passengers and 62 percent of women state that they have been harassed by fellow passengers; this perception is confirmed by all Metro bus drivers and 97 percent of LTC bus drivers and conductors.

Women also report being harassed by bus staff and passerbys. But both women and girls take limited action when they are harassed on public transport and 98 percent of respondents are unaware of existing emergency helplines or mobile phone apps to report sexual harassment.

About 94.8 percent of women are unaware of such laws and 99 percent have no knowledge of Pakistan Penal Code Section 509, which deals specifically with sexual harassment. Similarly, 92 percent of LTC bus drivers and conductors are unaware of pro-women laws.

Women commuters residing in Mughalpura, Kot Lakhpat and Harbanspura perceived a higher security risk at these bus stops. The observers at Kot Lakhpat Railway Station, LTC bus stops did not find these locations safe.

According to the women commuters, the police do not play their due role in addressing the sexual harassment of women on public transport.

All bus stops, even the newly-built Metro bus stations, fail to make provisions for women commuters with special needs.

These include pregnant women, those with young children, women with disabilities and elderly women.

Alarmingly, the entire public transport system neither addresses nor responds to the special need of people with disabilities.

The LTC bus stops are poorly managed, with inadequate lighting, missing benches, no signage, no dustbins, badly maintained overhead shades.

The report suggested that collecting sex-disaggregated data to effectively analyse and address the issues faced by women using public transport.

Furthermore, to make infrastructure and the integrated transport network women-friendly through gender sensitive planning.

The report was launched on Tuesday at local hotel in which Australian High Commissioner to Pakistan Margaret Adamson was chief guest.

Country Representative UN Women Pakistan Jamshed M Kazi, Punjab Women Development Department Secretary Bushra Aman, United Nations Women Program Lead Violence Against Women, Governance & Human Right Aisha Mukhtar, Lead Researcher of report Women Safety Audit Dr Raana Mali and Resident Director, Aurat Foundation Mumtaz Mughal, were present on the occasion.",['Faizan Ali Warraich'],"Share:LAHORE: Ninety percent women face harassment on public transport and 82 percent at bus stops.

LAHORE-Forced marriages are not a new phenomenon in Pakistan. In recent years, this issue has been highlighted by the print, electronic and social media. Rida Shah is an aspiring photographer from Islamabad who has captured the ordeal of those who get married against their will, through her lens.

Rida has a versatile portfolio ranging from random photography to theme based layout, and shoots for clothing lines.

Since civil society has now started to raise their voices to create awareness about ‘forced marriages,’ a number of people have come out to take a stand against it in their own way, and Rida Shah uses the power of her lens to highlight the issue of “forced marriages.”

In a recent spread on the Social Media site Instagram, she has shown how 21pc underage girls are being forced into marriage as given on the site ‘Girls not Brides’. The theme shows how a woman cannot speak her mind or give her opinion in such a scenario.

In one picture the model is shown with her feet tied with a rope depicting her forceful tying in a matrimonial relationship. The background of the spread have slogans in Urdu saying, Larki jawan hogai (the girl has matured), Larki to parai hai (parents’ home is a temporary abode for girls).

Rida Shah says that these ‘un-Islamic’ practices are being practiced openly in an Islamic society.

“In this so called Islamic society of ours, it is surprising how so many false and unfair practices are followed even by our most educated families. One of those is forcing your child to marry someone absolutely without their consent. ‘Abhe nae pasnd tou kia hua, aik bar nikkah krdo sb theek hojaega;’ (if you don’t like him now get married it will be alright later).

‘Bacha hai tou kia hua, prhae likhae shadi k bad krlega’” (what if she is a kid, she can complete her studies after marriage).

Rida said that she respects parents’ right to find a life partner for their children but Islam does not give them the right to force their decision on their children.

“I completely respect the fact that parents have the right to ‘suggest’ to their children who they should marry or not, but Islam does not give them the right to take this decision all by themselves, especially when their child is not willing to.”

Stats given in the post too show that an estimated 21% girls in Pakistan are forcefully married before the age of 18.

She went on to say that such marriages do not last long and the children blame their parents forever. She also believes that not only women are forced to marry but men also have to face such aggression in the family; however females have to bear this trauma more than males.

“These marriages either end up in divorces or children blaming their parents all their life.”

Speaking to The Nation, Rida Shah said, “I know a couple of people who have gone through this ordeal and how messed their life became after it. Parents need to realise that they are doing no good to their children by forcing them into marriage with someone they don’t want to marry.”

To a question as to why her model’s face is covered she said, “The face of the person is not important but the cause is. This is an issue which men and women face. My point was to highlight the issue and raise awareness about it.”

When asked if this project was supported by someone she said, “I have done this shoot all myself and used different places in my surroundings.”

In conclusion she said, “I know this practice will not end overnight, but I hope to have educated people about it so they can understand the importance of the issue and take a stand against it.”",['R Umaima Ahmed'],"Rida Shah is an aspiring photographer from Islamabad who has captured the ordeal of those who get married against their will, through her lens.

ISLAMABAD - Chairman Kashmir Committee Shehryar Khan Afridi on Monday said that Indian occupational forces were waging a ‘rape war’ using rape as tool of genocide against the freedom loving Kashmiris in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and the failure of world community in punishing the culprits of Kupwara mass rapes may lead to eruption of a new war between two nuclear neighbours.

He expressed these views while addressing the participants of a seminar titled ‘Mass rapes’ by occupational forces of India in Kunan Poshpora, Kupwara, Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir on February 23, 1991. The event was held under the auspices of Islamabad Institute of Conflict Resolution (ISCR) in liaison with Embassy of Azerbaijan.

Afridi said that until recently, there existed no punishment for ‘war rape’ in international law.

“War crimes or humanitarian law specifically focuses on the treatment of the civilian population and ‘any devastation not justified by military necessity.’ Thereafter, war rape has rarely been prosecuted as a war crime. Since 1949 Article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention explicitly prohibits wartime rape and enforced prostitution. The United Nations and the prosperous world needs to take steps to protect the weak and unprotected segments of society, Afridi said”

He said that repeated incidents of massacres and genocide reflected that the world had failed to protect the oppressed people living in conflict zones as “might is right prevails.”

Shehryar Afridi said that the mass rapes of women in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and Khojaly, Nagorno-Karabakh had been used by occupational forces as tool of genocide.

“Kunan Poshpora in Kupwara is the most scenic area of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir but the mass rapes of 1991 have left scars in the minds of the people of Kashmir,” he said. He said that expansionist designs of India were a threat to world peace and if the world failed to bring resolution to conflict zones like Jammu and Kashmir, no one could rule out possibility of a new war erupting between Pakistan and India.

“Any new war may suck in other nuclear powers of the region. Hence, this conflict may not remain limited,” warned Afridi.

He said that India was being ruled by a fascist regime of Narendra Modi who believed in Hindu supremacist ideology and all minorities in India were under a threat of genocide.

He said that unfortunately, rape was also used as a tool of punishment in conflict zones and history suggested that this one element of violence was used as an effective weapon and strategy for disarming psychological war. “This weapon of rape was used by many combatants and this global issue has no national boundaries of ideology or religion.”

He said it was more of associated with masculine identity commonly but in war times there was often violation of men and children too through different means of torture and distress.

“Therefore, it often does not remain gender bound but women being soft target are more of victim of rape in war precincts. There are many examples of such mass rapes during conflicts and war times during Rawanda genocide, Bosnia & Kosovo conflicts, Khojaly massacre by Armenian forces in Azerbaijan and not to forget Kashmir where such incidents occur frequently to suppress freedom movement,” he added.

Afridi said that in Kashmiri history, mass rape incident ensued in area of Kunan Poshpora in February 1991 and social stigma generated out of this incident was that women still faced difficulties in getting married.

He said that South Asian subcontinent was the least gender sensitive region in the world. It was the only region in the world where men outnumber women.

Azerbaijan Ambassador Ali Alizade highlighted the genocide perpetrated by the Armenian army in Nagorno-Karabakh area of Khojaly and said that the occupational forces committed massive killings to suppress the voices against freedom of Nagorno-Karabakh.

He said that despite United Nations Security Council resolutions, the world community failed to help the oppressed people of Nagorno-Karabakh.

He also urged the United Nations to hold plebiscite in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir as enshrined in the United Nations Security Council resolutions.

BEIJING : The son of a Chinese general has been charged with rape, state media said, in a case that has sparked public anger over the seemingly privileged lives of elite youths.

Li Tianyi, 17, ""is among five suspects who allegedly gang-raped a woman in a hotel"" in February, the Xinhua state news agency said late Monday.

The boy's father Li Shuangjiang holds the rank of general as dean of the music department for the Chinese army's Academy of Arts, and is known for singing patriotic songs. The public prosecutor's office only provided the surname of the suspect but confirmed ""the case is the same gang rape case"", Xinhua said. Li Tianyi triggered public controversy in 2011 after he and another teenager, both driving expensive cars, attacked a couple who reportedly blocked their passage, while the victims' child looked on.

After the incident drew widespread attention online, he was sent to a correctional facility for one year and the general apologised for his son's actions.

Public resentment has built in China towards the children of powerful officials and wealthy families viewed as living extravagantly or above the law due to their connections.

In one prominent scandal, the son of a police chief in 2010 tried to assert his father's status to avoid trouble for a fatal car accident.

LOS ANGELES - Brad Pitt is under investigation by US authorities after being accused of physically and verbally abusing his children during an angry outburst, TMZ reported Thursday. According to the entertainment news site the Los Angeles Police Department began probing Pitt based on an anonymous tip received by the LA County Department of Children and Family Services, as is systematic following any report of child abuse.

The news comes days after 41-year-old Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt, 52, citing irreconcilable differences and seeking custody of their six kids.

A British academic who blackmailed victims into sending him increasingly depraved images which he shared on dark web forums was jailed for 32 years on Monday after admitting 137 offences which included encouraging the rape of a four-year-old boy.

Dr Matthew Falder, 29, a geophysicist employed as a researcher at Birmingham University in central England, duped victims by masquerading as a depressed female artist on forums and mainstream online advertising websites.

He fooled them into sending him naked or partially clothed images of themselves before blackmailing them into sending more humiliating images by threatening to send the original pictures to their family, friends and employers.

Using the names “evilmind” and “666devil”, he then distributed the images on “hurt core” websites, hidden forums devoted to discussing rape, murder, sadism, torture, paedophilia, blackmail and degradation.

Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA), said he approached more than 300 people worldwide, with 45 victims represented in the charges against him.

The NCA set up a global taskforce with law enforcement officials from the United States, Australia and Europol and enlisted the help of the UK’s eavesdropping spy agency GCHQ during a four-year hunt to track down Falder who had used specialist anonymising techniques to remain hidden.

He was finally arrested in June last year and in October pleaded guilty to 137 charges which included encouraging rape, inciting sexual exploitation making indecent images of children and voyeurism.

“It is a tale of ever-increasing depravity,” Judge Philip Parker said as he sentenced Falder at Birmingham Crown Court.

“The effects on the girls, women and men were devastating. The damage is ongoing for these individuals. It will never end. Time and again people begged you to stop. Time and again you ramped up the pressure.”

At least three of the victims, who ranged in age from early teens to people in their 30s, tried to take their own lives. Falder, a graduate of Cambridge University, also secretly filmed adults he knew when they were in the shower using hidden cameras he had installed at a number of locations.

“Dr Matthew Falder thought he wouldn’t be caught,” said NCA operations strategic lead Matthew Long. “He would stop at nothing to exploit (the victims), to make them feel sad, humiliated and unhappy. Ultimately that has devastated some people’s lives.”",[],"Share:A British academic who blackmailed victims into sending him increasingly depraved images which he shared on dark web forums was jailed for 32 years on Monday after admitting 137 offences which included encouraging the rape of a four-year-old boy.

LAHORE - A young woman and her boyfriend were killed for bringing shame to the family at a village in Lahore’s Manawan neighbourhood early on Monday.

Police described the double-murder as honour killings and said that a suspect was arrested by police soon after the incident. The bodies were sent to the morgue for autopsy.

The deceased were identified as 21-year-old Nabeela and 20-year-old Usman. A police official said the girl had developed friendship with the boy, who was the resident of the same village.

The main suspect named by police as Naseer tried to flee after the killings but he was captured by locals and handed over to the police for interrogation. According to a police investigator, Naseer is the brother of Nabeela.

On the day of incident, Nabeela and Usman were talking to each other in the backyard of a house in the village when Naseer along with his accomplices appeared there and attacked them with a large knife and iron rods. As a result, both the victims died on the spot. The other attackers fled instantly but villagers managed to capture Naseer and handed him to the police for investigations.

The police also registered a double murder case and launched the homicide probe with no arrest made yet.

The incidents of killing for so-called honour are quite common in this Punjab province where more than 1,850 persons were murdered, mostly by relatives, for bringing shame to their families from 2011 to 2016.

The federal government, two years ago, introduced new laws to severely punish the criminals involved in honour killings but the legislation seems unable to stop ruthless and horrific killings even in urban parts of the country.

A young man was tortured to death allegedly by relatives of his ‘girlfriend’ in a village in the Hayer police precincts just two weeks ago.

Father of the deceased told the police that a group of men had attacked Saeed with iron rods when he was on his way home.

Pakistani playwrights - we need to talk. As if it wasn’t enough to have love troubles between a husband and his two wives or a husband and his friend’s wife or his cousin or cousin’s wife or wife’s sister or his ravishing colleague or his ex that he tossed out in a fit of rage and now wants back or something just as unappetizing, we are now romanticizing marital rape? I admit I haven’t watched our plays with undying dedication for the past decade or so, hence, I can be wrong in gawking and saying oh, my word since when?! But bear with me. The last serial I remember bearing this issue was Nijaat. Yep. 1993's awesome Nijaat - Marina Khan, Atiqa Odho, Noman Ajaz, Sajid Ali, Huma Nawab, and a host of other gems including Yusuf Ali who played the bad guy that forcibly marries a minor, then, locks her up every time he leaves the house because he is afraid she might otherwise escape. In that play, the issue wasn’t romanticized. It was creepy. And they showed it creepy. Although, the core idea was to protest against child marriage, it did subtly touch on the issue I’m discussing here and did it justice. DRAP announces helpline against 'irregular' prices But now, 21 years later, in the 21st century, we have the daring and dashing Bashar Momin.

Ew. I won’t deny I had hots for the character for the first 13 episodes. And then, he blew it. It would’ve been charming if he’d left her alone; been super hunky and swoon-worthy if he hadn't crossed that line - along with the line of physical abuse as well as aborting her pregnancy without her consent via poisonous juice. But the cherry on top wasn’t Bashar. Oh no! That honor went to his abused wife who fell in love with him. I mean - Stockholm syndrome? No brains? Bad taste? All of the above? Okay, fine, granted, he was the bad guy to begin with. The devil incarnate; the villain; the emotionally unstable fiend who subjected all around him to his uncontrollable fury/blackmail/manipulation/ bad drunk-boy acting, so, of course, it was only natural to spice it up by throwing sexual and physical abuse in the mix, too. Only, I think that’s a crime more heinous than money laundering. Also, I think the play set a tone for us to like him as it started out. Sindh reports 9 death, 888 new COVID-19 cases in last 24 hours Big fail. Stone him. The trend, however, seems to have caught on because in another play on another channel, an apparently good guy is found passionately doing the same to his witch of a wife.

In this one, the wife wants a divorce, he denies her, she falsely accuses him of impotency, so of course he kidnaps her, imprisons her and tells her he’ll let her go once he impregnates her. Yes, I had to get a lifetime supply of anti-nausea meds after that. It did teach me a valuable lesson with regards to eastern marital culture, though, or a culture that at least thrives in the heads of the drama makers if nowhere else. If the wife wants to save her marriage, she must be patient, submissive, stupid, and utterly sweet to the point that it poisons her. There are more plays than I can bear to watch on the plot where a husband conveniently forgets he has a wife - Aap ki Kaneez, Arranged Marriage,Rukhsar, Mere Mehrban, Mausam, Ghar ek Jannat, Malika Aaliya, and the list goes on. Hamilton wins Portuguese Grand Prix: Formula 1 On the contrary, if a man wants to save his marriage, he just needs to bully his wife and - you know - lock her up, up, up! Such a no brainer and so wrong to say he isn't making someone happy. The lock and key industry must be so thrilled over this newfound niche. So, this is it. This is our new dimension in relationships. After the media success of the Husband who emotionally and often physically abandons his wife, we now present to you the Husband who kidnaps and rapes his wife. Honestly, if we’re going to go with this sort of badness, then can we please have an over the top drop-dead chikna for the job? At least, it’ll be worth my while to ogle him if nothing else. However, the question remains: Where are the gentlemen? Will they seriously not make interesting heroes? Is it not sexy to be good anymore? I shall wait to be amazed…",['H. A.

Karachi - Caritas Pakistan’s Karachi chapter and the Catholic Women’s Organisation (CWO) jointly organised an awareness seminar with women and girls on forced conversion, child marriage and women’s rights.

The event took place in Kausar Naizi Colony, a Christian neighborhood of St Jude’s Parish of the Archdiocese of Karachi, on Nov 13. The objective of the seminar was to create awareness in the context of the Arzoo Raja case. Arzoo, a 13-year-old resident of Karachi’s Railway Colony, was abducted, married off to a 44-year-old Muslim man and converted to Islam. Her family is fighting a legal battle for her custody.

The case sent shockwaves throughout Pakistan, prompting religious minorities, particularly Christians, to hold nationwide protests. “Mothers play a very important role in family building to protect young girls from falling into the trap of wolves who prey on young girls and change their religion,” said Sister Catherine Qasir, a CWO coordinator.

“We must daily pray with all family members to spiritually strengthen and renew our faith in Jesus Christ and to fight against the forces of evil.” Tabassum Yousaf, a high court lawyer and counsel for Arzoo, shed light on the legal rights of minority girls as per the constitution of Pakistan. “Although abduction of an individual for the purpose of forced marriage is a criminal offense in Pakistan, it is one of, if not the most, widespread reported crimes against women in the country,” she said. Yousaf advised girls about how to keep themselves safe. She urged them to memorise the cell phone numbers of their parents and siblings.

She called on mothers to spend time with their daughters, befriend them, patiently listen to their problems and address them with love, care and respect.

“We must reinforce our commitment to provide quality education and equal opportunities to our young girls and children and start this from our family,” she added.

Mansha Noor, executive secretary of Caritas Karachi, said the Arzoo Raja case provides a useful opportunity for mothers and girls to learn about the menace of forced conversion and child marriage and their negative impact on society.

“What we learned from this seminar we must share with others and start implementation from our family if we have to save and protect young girls and children,” Noor said.

“We must remember the most beautiful quote of St Mother Teresa on the family that ‘the family that prays together stays together, and if they stay together they will love one another as God loved each one of them.’”",['Our Staff Reporter'],"Share:Karachi - Caritas Pakistan’s Karachi chapter and the Catholic Women’s Organisation (CWO) jointly organised an awareness seminar with women and girls on forced conversion, child marriage and women’s rights.

Mansha Noor, executive secretary of Caritas Karachi, said the Arzoo Raja case provides a useful opportunity for mothers and girls to learn about the menace of forced conversion and child marriage and their negative impact on society.","['arzoo', 'conversion', 'girls', 'karachi', 'family', 'seminar', 'young', 'mothers', 'forced', 'pakistan', 'marriage', 'child', 'examines', 'caritas']","{'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/rsss.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/android_app_on_play_logo_small.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/g_plus.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/linkedin_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png?date=2019-02-15', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/twitter.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-01/Lahore/epaper_img_1619815489.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_publishrr.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/utube.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2021-04-30/how-to-get-covid-19-vaccination-1619805870-9601.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/uploads/theme/logo-1550475639.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/whatsapp_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/facebook.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/app-store.png', 'https://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-01/Lahore/epaper_img_1619826878.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png'}",True,https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg,1,,,,,nation

KARACHI - Civil society members along with activists of Karachi Youth Forum (KYF), Awami Raaj Tahreek (ART), Sindh United Party (SUP), Jeay Sindh Qaumi Muhaz Bashir Group (JSQM-B) on Tuesday held a protest demonstration outside the Karachi Press Club (KPC) against the murder of a girl in Khairpur district.

Carrying placards, banners and portraits of a 14-year-old girl Rimsha Wassan, who was killed by alleged honour, they chanted slogans against feudal lords of the area.

The protest was led by Saad Memon of KYF, Arshad Bhan, Sarang Joyo, Gul Hassan Lakho and it was joined by Illahi Bux Bikak of JSQM-B, Khalil Chandio of Sindhi Adabi Sangat and veteran actor Hyder Qadir.

Speaking on the occasion, Saad Memon said that Rimsha Wassan was gunned down in front of her mother at her home by accused Zulfiqar Wassan who is said to be a frontman of former minister Manzoor Wassan. He regretted that the accused is yet to be arrested as he is being protected by the ruling party.

He appealed to the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Chief Justice of Sindh High Court and Inspector General of Police (IGP) Sindh to order action against the accused. Sarang Joyo said that every day girls are being killed under the so-called honor but the government is doing nothing against the feudal lords who conduct honor jirgas in their areas.

He said that opposition in Sindh Assembly was not allowed to bring a condemnation resolution against the murder of Wassan because the culprits are close to the ruling party.

Hyder Qadri said: ‘Being artist I am very sensitive and when I saw pictures of the killed girl, Rimsha, I was shocked.’’ He said such murders are very horrific and society should resist against honor killing.

Media reports say that Rimsha Wassan, 14, was reportedly shot to dead by accused Zulfiqar Wassan alias Zulfo, a few days back at her home in front of her mother over the allegations of honour. However, the main suspect is still at large, allegedly due to political pressure.

An anti-terrorism court (ATC) declared that three men had been charged with the murder of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Ali Raza Abidi.

All three men were brought to court, and did not plead guilty to the crime. The court postponed the hearing of the case until November 30, when witnesses will also be called to testify in the court.

Four suspects have been separately declared absconders in the case, with permanent arrest warrants issued for all four.

Police say that these suspects had been given 800,000 rupees to arrange the murder of Abidi. When they committed the crime, they also burned the motorcycle that was used to murder Abidi.

Ali Raza Abidi was killed on December 25 last year just outside his residence at Khayan-e-Ghazi in DHA Karachi. Gunmen opened fire on his vehicle, and Abidi was shot severl times in the head and neck as he got out of his car. The suspects then sped way after the attack.

Abidi was a controversial member of the MQM-P. In 2016, Abidi came under fire from within his party for what his fellow party members called his ""failure"" to follow the directives of MQM leader Altaf Hussain. Abidi also resigned from the National Assembly in 2017, saying that he had been unable to do anything for his constituents, and felt that there was something fundamentally wrong about the way the Rangers operation in Karachi had been conducted. Abidi was one of the few members of parliament who stood against a controversial cyber-crime bill pushed into legislature by the then Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government.

At the time of his death, many believed Abidi had been killed because of his vocal opposition towards the sectarian Ahl-e-Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ).

NEW DELHI: Indian police said Tuesday they are investigating four Christian priests for allegedly raping and blackmailing a woman in a cycle of abuse and threats lasting almost 20 years.

The woman told police that her ordeal began while still a minor in the 1990s when an Orthodox priest at a church in the southern state of Kerala forced her into sex.

She confessed to a second priest, who allegedly blackmailed her into having sex with him. A further two priests also threatened her and forced her into sex, the woman, who has not been named, told investigators.

“We filed a case on Monday based on her complaint. We have now started our investigation,” local police official S. Sreejith told AFP.

Her alleged suffering only came to light after an audio clip of her husband complaining to a church official went viral on social media, media reports said.

The Christan community in India, as elsewhere around the world, has been rocked by sexual abuse allegations.

Last year, a pastor accused of raping two women on the pretext of driving out evil spirits was arrested in eastern India.

In 2016, an Indian priest was sentenced to 40 years in prison for raping a 12-year-old girl.

It seems like the government is set to pass some of the most sweeping reforms to anti-rape laws—the Law Minister has confirmed that the parliament will soon promulgate an ordinance to introduce strict punishments for rapists and sex offenders including the death penalty and chemical castration. Several other important amendments are also being made, including expanding the definition of rape and prohibiting the controversial “two-finger” test.

The events of the previous year had made some legislative change absolutely necessary. Rape incident after rape incident had alarmed the public, with the lack of action and the victim-blaming attitude of some security officials generating negative attention for the government.

Some of the proposed provisions could go a long way in changing the way that rape is perceived in the country. More helpful than the introduction of the death penalty and castration, is the expansion of the definition of rape, which was severely lacking in previous laws. The new definition has been expanded to make the victim gender-neutral and has included other acts in addition to intercourse that constitute rape. This change is crucial—it now allows male children and members of the transgender community and other gender minorities to seek refuge under this law. However, there are some disturbing aspects of the legislation as well—it seems the age of consent has been needlessly lowered from sixteen to thirteen, a change which does not make sense considering the prevalence of sexual crimes against children and the incidents of child brides.

Nevertheless, the amendments introduced are a step in the right direction and hold great impact—it is a pity then that the government is including them in an ordinance rather than passing it as a bill in parliament, meaning that it will soon lapse. There is no political sense to it—this is an issue all parties are on board with.

https://nation.com.pk/20-Jan-2021/france-proposal-to-ban-islamic-veil-sparks-criticism,2021-01-20 15:48:19+05:00,Proposal to ban Islamic veil sparks criticism in France,"Share:

An ongoing debate on the controversial draft of a ""separatism"" bill has sparked criticism, resulted in a diversion, dividing the house on the question of veil, whether to include amendments to ban veiled students at the university and accompanying parents from displaying any religious symbols at school premises.

Several parliamentarians on Tuesday have deemed the move to be counterproductive.

Sacha Houlie, a member of President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist liberal La Republique En Marche party, warned that prohibiting university students and accompanying parents from public services and school trips, and preventing their participation in cultural and sporting activities would ""be totally counterproductive in relation to the very objective of this text which fought against the separatists"" and ""would refer these people to their identity"" so ""would favor the community withdrawal.""

Boris Vallaud, a member of the Socialist Party also reacted: “Students are users of the public service, this secularism does not apply to them.""

“To ban the veil at the university would be to say that all women who wear the veil pose a problem, which would mean we consider that it is Islam which poses a problem,"" said Pierre Yves Bournazel, an Act Together party member representing Paris.

A 2004 law prohibits the wearing or open display of religious symbols in all French schools, but it does not apply to universities. There is no law banning mothers from wearing the hijab on school trips, but there have been several instances when veiled women were verbally abused or asked to not accompany their wards.

The discussion was ignited by right wing and conservative Republican party member Eric Ciotti’s demand on Tuesday to ban the Islamic veil at the university. “We cannot tolerate that the university, temple of the knowledge of reason and science, can tolerate a garment of enslavement of the woman within it,’’ he told the hearing by the special commission examining the text of the bill “confirming respect for the principles of the Republic” at the National Assembly.

The government says the bill presented to the Council of Ministers on Dec. 9 aims to fight “separatism” and radicalization by a series of provisions such as banning polygamy or forced marriages, virginity certificates, homeschooling, controlling foreign funding, making places of worship more transparent, proscribing political meetings in a religious building, fighting against online hate speech and illegal content, among others.

Around 1,700 amendments were presented for discussion ahead of the examination of the bill which began on Monday, majority of which were labelled as “inadmissible”. This included an amendment by Aurore Berge and Jean-Baptiste Moreau, members of Macron’s party, to ban the wearing of the veil for ""little girls"" and mothers accompanying school trips, which was eventually rejected.

In a comment to the French daily Le Express, Berge said she stood by her suggestion, adding: “Supporting the improvement of access to abortion and fighting against the veiling of young girls are part of the same fight for the emancipation of women.

Earlier, Macron had warned over such amendments that there was a probable “danger to divert the debate on this question which has no place today” and it had ""no relation with the bill”.

“And this can lead to a stigmatization of Muslims, while we have repeatedly said it was not a text against the Muslim religion,” the daily Le Parisien quoted him as saying at a seminar last week.",[],"Boris Vallaud, a member of the Socialist Party also reacted: “Students are users of the public service, this secularism does not apply to them.""
A 2004 law prohibits the wearing or open display of religious symbols in all French schools, but it does not apply to universities.
There is no law banning mothers from wearing the hijab on school trips, but there have been several instances when veiled women were verbally abused or asked to not accompany their wards.
The discussion was ignited by right wing and conservative Republican party member Eric Ciotti’s demand on Tuesday to ban the Islamic veil at the university.
This included an amendment by Aurore Berge and Jean-Baptiste Moreau, members of Macron’s party, to ban the wearing of the veil for ""little girls"" and mothers accompanying school trips, which was eventually rejected.","['party', 'islamic', 'university', 'school', 'criticism', 'women', 'wearing', 'sparks', 'ban', 'veil', 'proposal', 'france', 'trips', 'member', 'bill']","{'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/rsss.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/android_app_on_play_logo_small.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/g_plus.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/linkedin_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/digital_images/medium/2021-01-20/france-proposal-to-ban-islamic-veil-sparks-criticism-1611139640-7290.jpg', 'https://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619912693.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png?date=2019-02-15', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/twitter.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_publishrr.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/digital_images/large/2021-01-20/france-proposal-to-ban-islamic-veil-sparks-criticism-1611139640-7290.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/utube.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/uploads/theme/logo-1550475639.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619902433.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/whatsapp_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/facebook.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/app-store.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2021-05-02/so-what-disaster-are-we-writing-about-today-stories-today-pandemic-pverty-scandal-1619896356-6502.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png'}",True,https://nation.com.pk/digital_images/large/2021-01-20/france-proposal-to-ban-islamic-veil-sparks-criticism-1611139640-7290.jpg,1,,,,,nation

RAWALPINDI - In a tit-for-tat action, Pakistan Army on Monday destroyed an Indian army post across the Line of Control and killed two soldiers hours after a Pakistani minor boy lost his life in Indian firing along the Line of Control (LoC).

“Pakistan Army troops neutralised Indian post which targeted a minor along LOC. Two Indian soldiers killed,” the military's media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Monday.

Nearly two hours earlier, Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor had said in a tweet that an eight-year-old boy named Ayan was killed in Indian firing in Janjot Bahadar, a village of Azad Jammu and Kashmir's Kotli district.

“Indian brutality takes life of an eight year old boy Ayan of Jajot village along LOC.” “Use of pellet guns in Indian Occupied Kashmir (IoK) and blatant targeting of innocent unarmed civilians across LoC exposes true Indian face,” the ISPR added.

On February 11, three civilians including two women were injured in Indian firing along the LoC in Battal, Hot Spring and Khuiratta sectors. Unprecedented escalation in ceasefire violations by India has been continuing since the year 2017 when the Indian forces committed more than 1900 ceasefire violations. In 2018, Indian forces have committed more than 150 violations, prompting befitting response from the Pakistani side.

LAHORE - A woman killed her two children and attempted suicide at her parent’s house in Raiwind, police said on Friday. Rescue workers said the 27-year-old mother was shifted to hospital with serious injuries around her neck. The bodies were sent to the morgue for autopsy.

Resident of Basti Sultanpura, Naheed Bibi killed her four year old son Ahtesham and five year old daughter Mahroba by throwing them into the water tank on the rooftop. The incident took place in the Raiwind city police precincts early Friday.

Initial police investigation revealed the woman later attempted suicide by slashing her neck with a sharp-edged weapon. Apparently, she took the extreme step after a clash at her in-laws, a police investigator said.

The official said Naheed was residing at her parents’ house for the lost eight months. She left her house over some dispute with her husband, Nasir, a resident of district Swabi.

According to relatives, some in-laws of Naheed reached her parents’ house on Thursday night to reconcile the dispute between the couple. But, they also clashed with the woman. Naheed killed her children before attempting suicide before dawn when all other members of her family were asleep.

The police later arrested the woman after registering a double murder case against her. Further investigation was underway.

Among the many issues aggravating the covid-19 pandemic has been the rise in violence against women reported the world over. Reports of domestic violence increased by 30% in France, over 50% in certain US states and tripling in China’s Hubei province, for instance.

In Pakistan, violence against women has been one of the goriest manifestations of human rights abuse. And as a result, the covid-19 lockdowns have seen its aggravation.

The so-called honour killings have persisted across the country, and even a global pandemic couldn’t cause a reduction. During the first month of the covid-19 lockdown in Pakistan, in Swat alone eight women lost their lives over ‘honour’.

According to the Barikot police, six of the women had been killed by their husbands, while two took their own lives. The police additionally reported attempted suicides as well, as they look to crack down on the culprits, and prevent further violence against women.

“The police took timely action… and filed report under the honour killing laws,” Barikot’s Deputy Superintendent of Police Badshah Hazrat said.

Multiple legislations, aiming to prevent honour killings, have been in place for decades. These include the 2006, Protection of Women Act of 2006, the Third Amendment to the Criminal Law Act from 2011, and the Punjab Protection of Women against Violence Act along with the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Offences in the name or pretext of Honour) Act passed in 2016. However, the implementation of these laws has been a concern.

Even bigger question mark has been over addressing the patriarchal setup of the society and the ideals that have historically been used to justify violence against women.

Among the many forms of violence justified through aggressive misogyny is domestic violence, which has seen a global rise in recent weeks. With families locked down, and no escape for many owing to the pandemic, the violence against female family members has increased.

Furthermore, with the global pandemic causing multiple crises, the impact of those has also translated into a rise in domestic violence – which often self-manifests in abusing the most vulnerable.

Mental health professionals and other medical practitioners, currently offering telehealth services in Pakistan, have reported that domestic abuse has significantly increased during the lockdown. Some health professionals have even reported that online health sessions are being cut short under intimidation or fear of a violent backlash. Not only women, but children have been bearing the brunt of the abuse during lockdowns as well.

Pakistan’s Human Rights Ministry has noted the vulnerability of women and children during the covid-19 crisis, and has set up a helpline to curtail the violence.

“Lockdowns and quarantine measures often leave women and children vulnerable to domestic abuse and violence — which is known to rise during emergencies. Our helpline is here to help you. Dial 1099 or call/text us on WhatsApp: 03339085709,” the official Twitter handle of the ministry posted.

Federal Human Rights Rabia Javeri Agha has further underlined that efforts are ongoing to protect women. She says that the ministry is looking to raise awareness with regards to the rights of women, and providing the victims the help that they needed.

“Women are more vulnerable to violence due to the current lockdown, as male family members target them due to frustration. We are evolving a comprehensive plan to counter domestic violence and create awareness among women [during the pandemic],” Agha said.",['Kk Shahid'],"Share:Among the many issues aggravating the covid-19 pandemic has been the rise in violence against women reported the world over.

Life is hard for women in the patriarchal societies of India and Pakistan with hundreds of incidents of rape recorded every year. The actual figures may be much higher than what is reported in the media and reports published by human rights groups. A series of incidents has led to Delhi being branded as the rape capital of the world. The situation in Pakistan from urban centers to rural areas is not better in any way. According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), an incident of rape occurs every two hours and a person is gang-raped every four to eight days. These are alarming statistics, which point towards the state’s failure to protect predominantly female victims. While the law offers strict punishment for rapists, it is often not implemented due to societal pressures and corruption in the criminal justice system.

Rape victims in Pakistani and Indian societies often choose to remain silent due to fear of stigmatization at the hands of police and the wider society. They are often viewed as responsible for bringing ‘shame’ upon themselves and their families. Some do not even reveal what they’ve gone through to their families and are forced to deal with the trauma on their own. Once identified as a rape victim, women find themselves ostracised and denied opportunities to lead a normal life once again. They are not deemed fit for marriage and not allowed to recover from incidents that occur due to no fault of their own. The sort of social awareness and legal campaigns that have been recently carried out in India following the brutal rape of a Delhi student in a bus are yet to be witnessed in Pakistan. While anti-rape legislation has been introduced in the country’s parliament, there is plenty that needs to be done to rectify the situation. Problems are exacerbated by anti-women entities such as the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), which stands against employing DNA evidence to identify and convict rapists. Moreover, tribal jirgas that mediate in the absence of a legal body often pass decisions that either endorse rape or are otherwise unfavourable to rape victims.

In both India and Pakistan, there is a serious lack of education, which encourages patriarchal tendencies amongst men who don’t think twice before attacking women to exercise power. Since sex remains a taboo in these societies, sexual frustration emerges as a key factor behind incidents of rape. However, the affects of ignorance and sexual frustration would not have been so destructive if not for the poor implementation of the law, which leaves culprits undeterred and emboldened. The menace will not be curbed as long as the state and its judicial system comes down heavily against the aggressor and in favour of the victim.",[],"Share:Life is hard for women in the patriarchal societies of India and Pakistan with hundreds of incidents of rape recorded every year.

SYDNEY-A 14-year-old girl who as a child was the face of iconic Australian outback hat firm Akubra has taken her own life over online bullying, say her family.

In a Facebook post, the father of Amy “Dolly” Everett called for more awareness of bullying so his daughter’s life “will not be wasted”. Akubra also expressed its condolences, issuing a call for all to “stand up” against any kind of bullying.

One in five children in Australia say they were bullied in the past year.

In his emotional Facebook post, written on Sunday, Dolly’s father, Tick Everett, gave no details of the bullying, but said she had wanted to “escape the evil in this world”. He said he hoped the attention on Dolly’s death last week might “help other precious lives from being lost”.

He also invited the bullies to her funeral, saying: “If by some chance the people who thought this was a joke and made themselves feel superior by the constant bullying and harassment see this post, please come to our service and witness the complete devastation you have created.” On Wednesday, the family released a statement to media outlets saying Dolly had been “the kindest, caring, beautiful soul”. “She was always caring for animals, small children, other children at boarding school who were less fortunate than herself.”

The family shared a recent drawing by Dolly showing a skinny figure bent over backwards underneath the words: “Speak even if your voice shakes.”

“This powerful message tells the dark, scary place our beautiful angel had travelled to,” her family said.

According to Australian broadcaster ABC, the family also said they wanted to establish a trust to raise awareness of bullying, anxiety, depression and youth suicide. The wide-brimmed rabbit-fur Akubra hat is one of Australia’s most recognisable brands, closely associated with rural outback life.

Dolly starred in a well-known ad campaign for the brand when she was eight.

“Bullying of any type is unacceptable,” the company wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. “It is up to us to stand up when we see any kind of bullying behaviour. Dolly could be anyone’s daughter, sister, friend.” It urged readers: “Be a friend, check up on your mates.”

According to Australia’s National Centre Against Bullying (NCAB), while overall bullying rates have marginally declined over the past decade, cyberbullying has seen a sharp increase.

“What’s different in the case of cyberbullying is that it can be constant, 24/7,” Jeremy Blackman of the NCAB told the BBC. “Another big factor is the anonymity on the internet,” he said, explaining this can make it harder for people to feel any empathy for their victims.

“What it means it that more children can be bullies,” he says.

Despite services and help lines available, teenagers are very reluctant to report when they are victims of bullying, according to NCAB, and only reach out for help if their situation has become unbearable.

There are no official statistics on suicides due to bullying. While national suicide rates in Australia are declining, the number of people between 15 and 24 taking their own life has seen a rise in recent years.",[],"In a Facebook post, the father of Amy “Dolly” Everett called for more awareness of bullying so his daughter’s life “will not be wasted”.

CHENNAI: Measuring flour, whisking eggs and folding batter, K. Asma forgets the deep scars that run down her face and neck as she bakes cupcakes in an upscale cafe in the Indian port city of Chennai.

Four years ago, Asma poured kerosene on herself and lit a match, after reaching breaking point in an abusive marriage. By setting herself on fire, Asma had meant to scare her husband into stopping the violence.

""I was thinking a small burn mark, some ointment and back to work as a sweeper cleaning the city roads after a day,"" Asma told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""I didn't think the fire would consume me and my life would become a living hell.""

The 29-year-old is one of seven victims of domestic abuse hired by Writers' Cafe in a pilot project to help them regain their self-esteem while learning new skills that could provide some financial independence.

India first recognised domestic violence as a criminal offence in 1983 and amended the penal code to include cruelty by a husband or his family against a married woman as a crime.

Last year, there were a reported 327,394 crimes against women in India, 35 percent of which were classified as ""cruelty by husband or relatives"", according to the National Crime Records Bureau.

The overall crime rate was down by 3.1 percent compared to 2014, but data showed an 8 percent increase in cases brought under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. In 2015, 461 cases were registered against 426 in 2014.

SUICIDE BID

Hiding bruises and staying quiet, many women in India, especially in rural areas, accept violence as a normal part of life.

Many envisage suicide as the only way out with hanging, poisoning and self-immolation common causes of death.

Like Asma, Parimala Gopi is also part of the Writers' Cafe pilot project, and had also tried to set herself alight after enduring years of domestic violence.

""I could see the horror in the face of my children when they saw me,"" Gopi, 35, said. ""I could deal with my pain but seeing theirs broke my spirit.""

At Chennai's Kilpauk Medical College burns ward, one of the largest in southern India, doctors treat up to 100 women a month for burns from kerosene and alcohol. Often the injuries are self-inflicted.

Counsellors at the hospital said that 60 percent of the cases have third-degree burns that prove fatal.

""Among those who survive, we found that many were dying after discharge from the hospital,"" said Prasanna Gettu of International Foundation for Crime Prevention and Victim Care, a support agency for victims and survivors of domestic abuse.

""They did not have enough money to take care of their diet or the medication they needed to heal. Families were not being supportive and many were just withering away. They needed jobs.""

HAPPINESS

At Writers' Cafe, Swiss baker Silke Stadler and chef Karan Manavalan, who are training the women to bake cakes, said their aim is to create a positive workplace where the women are not judged for past actions.

""It is a good space to make things right for them,"" Stadler said.

Aniruddha Sen, the chief executive of CC Fine Foods South India Private Limited, which opened Writers' Cafe, said his company planned to open similar cafes in 2017.

""We want them (the women) to have permanent livelihood through this venture,"" he said.

Projects like this and Sheroes' Hangout, a cafe run by survivors of acid attacks in the western city of Agra, are helping women find their place in society, campaigners say.

""It has been a long journey for these women to simply say yes to a job,"" Gettu said.

""They have battled stigma and their own insecurities before stepping out of their homes, boarding a bus, ignoring the stares and getting to work.""

Asma does not mind that many people on the bus choose not to sit next to her during her daily commute to work.

""I just think about the work and the 10,000 rupees ($147) I earn every month,"" she said.

""Baking that cake makes me forget everything, even my gnarled hands and scarred face. I find a little bit of happiness,"" Asma said.",[],"The 29-year-old is one of seven victims of domestic abuse hired by Writers' Cafe in a pilot project to help them regain their self-esteem while learning new skills that could provide some financial independence.

KARACHI - Pakistan Peoples Party MPA Sharmila Farooqui said on Sunday that nation would make real socio-economic progress when women are provided all equal rights at par with men across the country as the status of women in Pakistan differ considerably across classes, regions and the rural-urban divide and tribal and feudal social formations.

“Pakistan’s women want to pass life free from stigma, torture, harrassement and violence and need a future that’s sustainable, peaceful, with equal rights and opportunities for all. To get us there, the country needs women at every table where decisions are being made. Real national progress will come after women provided all rights,” she said in a statement on the occasion of the International Women’s Day being observed on March 8.

She paid tributes to Mohtarrma Benazir Bhutto and Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah for playing role to empower women and boosting demcracy in Pakistan.

“This year, UN Women has announced the theme for International Women’s Day 2021 as ‘Women in leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 world.’ The theme celebrated the tremendous efforts by women and girls around the world in shaping a more equal future and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Women from medical professional also took active part as frontline soldiers in fight against coronavirus in Pakistan,” she said. Sharmila said women in Pakistan made up 48.76 percent of the population and had played an important role in the country’s history. In Pakistan, women had held high offices including that of the Prime Minister, Speaker of the National Assembly, Leader of the Opposition, as well as federal ministers. However, there was need to further empower them, she added.

“Women in Pakistan face discrimination as result of patriarchal society of Pakistan. Some of the problem faced by women in the country are domestic violence, honour killing, rape and abduction, marital rape, and forced marriages, which needs to be ended by implementing all existing laws,” she said.

Reffering to reports, she said that the Global Gender Gap Index report 2020 ranked Pakistan 151 out of the total 153 countries. Another survey ranked Pakistan as sixth most dangerous country for women.

https://nation.com.pk/14-Dec-2014/violence-against-women-and-girls,2014-12-14 15:06:36+05:00,Violence against women and girls,"Share:

It has been 25 years since the Montreal Massacre where 25 year old Marc Lépine felt compelled to go on a murder spree against women attending the École Polytechnique [Montreal University branch]. He viewed the young women studying in the field of STEM as feminists [who were threatening his male identity]. He ordered the men to leave the classroom and after successfully separating the males from females, he pulled the trigger on his first 9 female victims—killing 6 and critically injuring 3. He then walked through the school and continued the murder spree before turning the gun on himself. His war on women lasted 20 minutes on the evening of December 6, 1989, and in those terrifying 20 minutes—14 women lost their lives and 10 other women were injured along with 4 men.

He declared [to the students] he was at war with feminism. He left behind a suicide note identifying his targets, intentions and reasoning. He also expressed concerns of being painted a madman by the media by reassuring [in the note] that he is quite rational. As he shot the first 9 victims, he claimed they were studying to become engineers therefore they must be feminists. In Lépine’s world—a woman who makes use of her intellect is a feminist and deserving of death.

Misogyny walked the halls of an educational institution and took down 14 lives in its own honour that evening.

What Lépine felt wasn’t unique—many felt [and continue to feel] his pang—along with the MRA (Male Rights Activism) movement who hailed him a “hero”. He felt hatred for women who dared to live a life free of conformity to a patriarchal culture. His interpretation of “feminists” was women who were educated and independent—and so it was clear [to him] they had to die. He was sending these sinners to meet their “Maker” and soon after the massacre, the apologia and unnecessary confusion on the “why” began.

It had nothing to do with violence against women and girls (VAWG)—he was a “madman” with a gun and a knife [as he predicted he’ll be portrayed] who was ‘acting out’ because of his father’s abuse! Ignore his suicide letter—his words don’t matter. When it comes to the realm of crimes against the female gender—no amount of physical evidence is valid enough to deliver justice by labeling the crime for what it really is. What matters is how the world can now deviate from the concern of VAWG by deflecting this sinister act [deeply rooted from misogyny and sexism] and reiterate Lépine’s own view on how great women and girls have it in society.

For those living in the West, the name Elliot Rodger also rings a bell. He provided a manifesto declaring a “war on women” because they [the women] rejected his sexual advances. The manifesto also contained his contempt for other men who had better sexual opportunities [with women]. He also provided a scathing rant on his hatred for racial minorities and the LGBTQ. So, on May 23, 2014, in Isla Vista [California], the 22 year old Elliot Rodger casually commenced his “retribution” on the “sluts” and the men of these “sluts”, and the racial minorities and anybody else that was in the remote vicinity of his prowling. He murdered 6 people and injured 13 others before killing himself.

But society believed the trigger point of Rodger’s was a mental disorder because he killed men too—so there’s no way it could have been even partially triggered by misogyny—in fact, it was described as a non-VAWG crime because he was just a mentally unstable young man with an undiagnosed condition.

Rodger spent sufficient time in MRA forums [that are infamous for inciting VAWG and dictating misogyny and sexism]. His “retribution” video on YouTube specifically identified the source of his rage—which was that he was a lonely, sexually deprived, 22 year old male virgin [and the girls and women who had rejected him since he reached puberty needed to be punished for such “injustice” and “crime”]. He also blasted his family members and yet all the evidence contained in his manifestos clearly pinpoint the trigger was a result of rejection by the “beautiful” women and girls he had pursued.

They should have embraced him instead of being alarmed by his questionable behaviour! He’s the “supreme gentleman”—how could women and girls just pass up his charm?!

Once again—the killer’s own words are irrelevant even though he gave his reasoning on a platter of misogyny, sexism and racism topped with a dressing of narcissism and gun powder.

To brush this off as an act of another madman of society [who just happened to also have a misogynistic rage he thoroughly documented and left behind as evidence prior to the attacks] only encourages more boys and men who feel justified in their misogyny.

I doubt the people who suffer from genuine mental illness take pleasure in being grouped in with the likes of Marc Lépine and Elliot Rodger and be indirectly implicated in acts of such violence as if they aren’t already facing enough abuse under the stigma of mental illness.

The horrific murder of Zahra Abdille and her two children [from Toronto] was one of the stories of VAWG and domestic violence that made headlines on November 29, 2014 in Canada.

Zahra Abdille had fled to a shelter due to domestic violence. She expressed concerns for the safety of her two children, Faris and Zain, and herself, at the hands of her husband, Yusuf Abdille. She attempted to get custody of the children but she was a nurse and made more income than what would qualify her for assistance from Legal Aid Ontario (LAO)—so it was reported LAO refused her a certificate to retain a lawyer and her efforts for custody were presumed unsuccessful. What were her choices—or rather what was the only choice the system had left her? She couldn’t afford private housing or a lawyer to fight her abuser legally. So she went back to live with her husband, hoping for a reconciliation. Soon after Zahra and her two children returned to live with Yusuf, they were murdered. Yusuf then committed suicide by plummeting off a bridge and was run over by a vehicle.

If he can’t have her—no one else can—not even Zahra herself.

The skeptics of marital rape make the survival of women fleeing domestic violence more difficult. I would like to welcome these skeptics to the civilized world where a marriage contract has never once equated consent to sexual activity.

A marriage contract is a unity of people—not a license to violate a woman’s body.

VAWG is a primitive form of violence and oppression; it’s an age-old apartheid enforced by religion and other patriarchal fronts. The greatest threat to every woman and girl is daring to live even an ordinary life of choice free of male discretion—which the women and girls living in the East can attest to on a wider spectrum.

The nature of VAWG taking place in the East isn’t too different from the ones occurring in the West. The only obvious difference would have to be the navigation pertaining to the survival of the victims. The West provides safer access to resources for women and girls to deal with the abuse. The west also has a better legal support system protecting female rights along with better economical standard which helps fortify their survival.

Wherever there is VAWG—it goes hand in hand with financial abuse. Developing nations with economic gender inequality also has one of the worst rates of human rights abuse [disproportionately affecting the female population].

Pakistan is number two on the list led by Chad as the top two worst countries with economic inequality. Women in the West still make approximately 20% less on an equal job to their male counterpart—this ratio is much worse in the developing world. Over 70% of minimum wage jobs are also held by women and girls worldwide.

In the East, the rate of women dying by freak accidents like a kitchen gas explosion is questionably high [as it occurs often in south Asia]—especially when it is reported the in-laws have dowry feuds with the bride and her family.

Yes, “dowry” is still a thing in the East because nothing speaks “love” like buying a bride.

In the Middle East and Central Asia, countless women and girls have been horrifically injured or died as a result of being doused with acid and other forms of violence for refusing to wear certain religious attire or conform to the idea that females are inferior to males.

Less than 50% of females are literate in most developing nations, mainly due to cultural bans on education for their gender. The outrage the demand for universal education creates is beyond any logical comprehension. Malala Yousafzai, the brave little girl from Pakistan advocating for educational rights, took a bullet to the head for her line of activism. That’s how deadly it is to obtain education while being a female in some countries in the 21st century.

Every day, 23,000 girls under the age of 18 are forced to marry a man twice their age and end up becoming voiceless victims of physical and sexual abuse while being used for the purpose of giving birth—but criticizing this trend of human rights abuses foreigners deem “cultural and religious rights” is labeled “gross and racist” by western pseudo liberals like Ben Affleck who unwittingly promote gender apartheid and anti-liberal democracy in the developing world.

In nations like Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan—there is a great volume of female prisoners who are found “guilty” of “moral crimes” which range from being a victim of sexual violence to domestic violence. There is also an alarming rate of women being accused of “adultery” by their husband whenever there are unresolved marital conflicts—and the punishment for such a crime is almost always death.

And in all nations—there’s foeticide—where the fetus is aborted simply because it is a female instead of a male. With this kind of parental love—who needs the MRA?

In the USA, the rights of females are constantly under threat by religious and conservative zealots. Recently, the state of Michigan passed a bill banning abortion coverage in insurance plans and suggested if a woman or girl require abortion due to sexual violence—these women and the parents of underage female children should buy a separate insurance plan that will cover abortion in the case of rape. Basically, consider yourselves as a future rape victim if you want an abortion after being impregnated by rape. Haven’t you realized by now that VAWG can be committed upon you at any random time and if you don’t have this “rape insurance” handy—you’ll be forced to relive the trauma by giving birth to a child who was created through an abhorrent crime committed upon you. That’s the message USA is working hard to enforce on its female population.

Who can forget Arizona? It’s another state in the USA, much like Michigan, and it too is eager to trample on the rights of women and girls. They want to grant employers the right to fire female employees who take birth control for the prevention of pregnancy—in other words—dictate their sexual life. As if religious and cultural fanaticism wasn’t already keeping the rights of women and girls in the dark ages—this land of the free that preaches about democracy wants to police women’s sexual lives and meddle with their reproductive rights which play a primary role in VAWG.

A woman or girl who is suffering VAWG is undeniably in the most vulnerable state while pregnant. Most victims who report physical and sexual abuse at the hands of an intimate partner also reported the severity of violence escalated when they were discovered to be pregnant.

The number one killer of women is not cancer—it is in fact VAWG. While a little over 6,500 US soldiers died in the Iraq and Afghanistan war combined—almost 12,000 women died within the same period in USA as a result of VAWG.

In Canada, over 3000 women flee domestic violence every night and live in shelters [with their children] just so they don’t end up becoming a gruesome evening news scene. Understand that if these women did not have a shelter to find refuge in—they will become homeless with their children which increases vulnerability to all sorts of violence from rape [by strangers] and kidnapped and forced into the slave-sex-trafficking industry which is globally a multimillion dollar “business” and a vast majority of its victims also happen to be women and children.

Race-based misogyny is as prevalent as any other form of misogyny. Women and girls of colour face a dire form of systematic and domestic abuse. Their rights as immigrants is already limited by the system that dehumanize their gender only to be further crippled by the phobia of the melanin levels in their body [or I can just say their “skin colour” but I really don’t want to oversimplify the bigotry of racism]. VAWG is a double threat to this female population because they have to endure both cultural and race-based misogyny.

Many women are scrutinized for not “leaving” abusive relationships—yet nobody dare tell them where they are supposed to go legally. As explained above, the system makes sure majority of victims are financially less privileged so they can’t move to another country or city nor can they afford a lawyer or shelter in moments of need. It’s like being trapped in a warzone and being denied refuge in neighboring countries, just waiting to be killed.

Even in cases of highly documented domestic violence—family courts rarely allow a mother to relocate to another city with her children [far from the abusive parent] because even if he had beat and raped the mother, he still has the right to see the children [even if he had abused the children too]—so the children always end up becoming used as leverage [by the abuser] to punish the woman for ending the relationship. And if by chance she does find her own housing—the abuser will stalk her and the children at work and/or at school.

So why doesn’t she just get a restraining order? Assuming we’re discussing the VAWG occurring in the Western world [because in most developing Eastern nations, there’s no such thing as a “restraining order” for women fleeing violence]—a restraining order isn’t as powerful as many believe and it isn’t simple to obtain either. If the courts do grant a restraining order and the abuser starts violating it—the chances of the abuser being found guilty of contempt of the order is difficult. He can violate the order 6 times in a row and still the police will refuse to lay charges because in the court of law—the act of violating the restraining order must be proven as an “intentional” act. So as long as the abuser keeps claiming the violations were all “accidental”—he will rarely face charges. And on most stalking cases related to VAWG and domestic violence—the stalker ends up murdering or physically harming his partner and/or their children.

When it comes to male stalking—the likelihood of it escalating to sexual or physical violence and/or murder is exponentially high in comparison to female stalking and that is the statistic which helped set a better foundation to combat VAWG in Canada [by enforcing the police to view all stalking complaints as legitimate]—not that it has prevented stalkers from stalking their victims but it had rather provided a relief from the world of skepticism and empowered victims to come forward.

So, back to the question of “why doesn’t she just leave him”—are these women supposed to leave their children with their abusive partner and flee for their own safety or do they take a chance and remain with the abuser to continue being tortured so their children aren’t harmed behind closed doors and suffer as they did? The court system is definitely not giving them a fair chance to fight the abuse legally.

Damned if she leaves and damned if she stays. That’s “why”.

We know the names of the victims of Marc Lépine, Elliot Rodger and Yusuf Abdille—they’re all just a simple Google search away. But what about the names of victims we don’t read or hear about? We know that in Canada a woman is murdered by her intimate partner every 5 days—but the media doesn’t report about a dead woman every 5 days. So where are the tears of indignation and outrage for this unprecedented scale of violence [stemming from misogyny] women and children face across every nation on this planet we dare call home?

If the world collectively writes obituaries every time a women and girl are killed by male entitlement—would that reduce the skepticism? Rejecting the scale of VAWG is no different from rejecting science and insisting the Earth is flat and at the center of the universe and the human race was birthed from the incestuous relationship of Adam and Eve’s children. If you believe in evolution—it’s time to start considering the evolution of misogyny which is being celebrated as “culture”, “tradition” and “religion”.

The finest way to discuss VAWG is through the most flagrant method of communication—laying out facts just the way they are without filters and frills. Women and girls are human beings—their lives aren’t tainted material that must be filtered for the usage of someone else for the purpose of “tradition”.

Only solution to end VAWG [and domestic violence] is to denounce the objectification of the female gender and make solidarity for these victims louder than the silence that keeps them bound and bruised and leaves them much too often in a pool of their own blood.

VAWG is in fact a global health crisis—affecting millions of women and girls. This continues to make Feminism a valid and necessary movement no matter how much it is deemed a glorified villain by the world of Patriarchy because in this world of Patriarchy—there will be neither proper justice nor democracy until women, girls and LGBTQ are emancipated from its grip.

People often conveniently forget that females are co-creators of society. There isn’t a foot of intellectual value in any society until absolute equality is mandated as a fundamental human right [for all genders] across the globe [without prejudice] and until the occurrence of this phenomenon—humanity will continue to squander its mutual endurance and commit itself to a much darker social crisis.

If you want to help end VAWG—it’s imperative to concede to its reality—concede to the fact that it’s the most prevalent form of violence. Most acts of VAWG are almost never committed in the hallways of a public institution or sidewalks, nor do the abusers leave behind a manifesto to identify their guilt. It’s committed behind closed doors where the only witnesses are the abusers and their victims which is why the only person who can actually “stop” VAWG is the abuser. The only way the abuser can do this is by acknowledging the victims as equal human beings and the only way to even remotely convince abusers of this fact is by holding them accountable for their own actions.

It’s a tough pill to swallow when one lives in a glass house thriving off the convenience provided by the enslavement of the female gender.

Racism triggers people to protest and march the streets, demanding justice. But for misogyny—the most common serial element in all races, cultures, religions and nationalities—all it triggers is skepticism and mockery. Every life matters—which means female lives matter too—so hashtag that.

Misogyny isn’t a faceless, invincible God that creates nonbelief—it is a tyrant in the form of the worst human rights abuse taking place since the dawn of civilizations and into the 21st century. It has a face. It has a name—violence against women and girls.

Before the arrival of our next century, we must canvas VAWG and apply permanent solutions. It’s beyond appalling to witness tolerance to a world that romanticizes misogyny as culture, religion and tradition. What’s more devastating is how it is worshiped in the name of bronze aged nonsense. It’s time to issue a confession on this collective bigotry and end it once and for all.

Willful ignorance will not alter the necessity to leave behind the puerile mindset and get used to the reminder of what greatness every living, breathing women and girls could have been long accomplishing since the get-go if only they hadn’t been dehumanized and enslaved to childbirth and male egotism.

Domestic violence is not a new phenomenon as far as Pakistan is concerned, but in the past three months the acts went beyond any limit. Most of the victims were minors and teenage girls, though married and unmarried, as well as aged women too suffered the same fate, to be subjected to heinous offences of murder, honor killing, instigation to suicide, sexual assault, torture, gang rape, prostitution, molestation and notably Karo Kari and Jirga verdicts.

In our patriarchal society, women are dominated and exploited, though Islam raised the status of women, none of that is seen in truth. It is obvious that the crime against women were committed by feudal lords and local self-designated lords and at the same time our impotent authorities dancing to their tunes. Most remorsefully, our law enforcement agencies help these feudally arrange Jirgas. There are strong politicians backed by the police involved in most crimes, so who will catch them, or punish them?

https://nation.com.pk/04-Jan-2017/urgent-need-for-family-planning,2017-01-03 21:52:49+05:00,Urgent need for family planning,"Share:

Samia* was married off at a very young age. Her husband worked at a brick kiln. Despite working several jobs, her husband was incapable to support his growing family. Samia started working alongside him on a farm in an effort to feed her children.

During her marriage, she gave birth to seven girls. Pressured by her husband and in-laws to produce a son, she once again became pregnant. Frequent and closely-spaced pregnancies, though, took a toll on her health and the village midwife warned the family that Samia should not continue the pregnancy as it would endanger her health and the health of her fetus.

Paying no heed to the warning, Samia’s in-laws forced her to continue the pregnancy. Shortly after giving birth to her eighth child – a stillborn boy – Samia passed away.

Sadly, Samia’s case is not unusual. According to the report ‘State of Family Planning in Pakistan’, more than 80 women in Pakistan die each day due to preventable complications during pregnancy. The latest data confirms that the total fertility rate – or average number of children a woman would have if she survives all her childbearing years – remains high at 3.8, and is highest among women in rural areas and those with the lowest level of education.

Low mortality and high fertility sustained over a long period of time has serious implications for the structure, composition and distribution of population.

Pakistan is on the brink of a population explosion. With an estimated population of nearly 192 million, and a growth rate of 1.92 percent, Pakistan has become the sixth most populous country in the world. With the population growing at an alarming rate of two percent every year, it is likely that Pakistan’s population will reach 343 million people by 2050.

Considering the extreme pressures of over-population, what can be done to reduce the total fertility rate in Pakistan? And what can be done to prevent tragic and unnecessary deaths like Samia’s?

Improved access to quality healthcare that includes family planning counseling and services, antenatal and obstetric care, nutrition counseling and immunization services can easily save the lives of women such as Samia. Despite some progress in recent years on nutrition and immunization, accesses to family planning services and supplies have not been prioritised.

The provision of family planning services in Pakistan is hindered by many factors. These include illiteracy, poverty, religious barriers, poor access, traditional beliefs, misconceptions, lack of trained providers and poor coordination of health programmes.

Based on data shared by Population Council in its report on family planning, Pakistan has one of the lowest contraceptive prevalence rates in the region; out of 31 million married women of reproductive age in the country, less than 26.1 percent currently use modern contraceptives.

In Pakistan, the use of contraceptives is still considered a taboo topic. Despite maternal mortality rate of 276 deaths per 100,000 live births, next to nothing is being done to help women control their fertility rate. Most women don’t use a modern contraceptive method as their families mistakenly believe it is equivalent to abortion or leads to infertility. On the other hand, when it comes to men, people deem it forbidden to discuss birth control.

With the subject considered taboo, the society terms it a controversial matter that provokes vulgarity in sheer contradiction to injunction of their religion. All advertisements regarding preventive measures were stopped by the government regulatory body after viewers branded it immoral and unsavory to the nation’s social fabric.

Although the decision was soon revoked, PEMRA directed all electronic channels to avoid the airing of such advertisements during primetime.

Family planning is desperately needed in Pakistan due to the rapid increase in population and the resultant severe strains on economic resources, development and security. Family planning can curb population growth which, in turn, can contribute to sustainable social-economic development.

At the Family Planning London Summit in 2012, the government committed to working toward achieving universal access to reproductive health and raising the contraceptive prevalence rate to 55% by 2020. In order to achieve this, they must ensure the following:

First, voluntary and universal access to family planning is applicable to all, irrespective of their socio-economic status, gender, religion and marital status.

Second, young people, approximately 60% of the population in Pakistan, must be better informed and supported to exercise the right of family planning.

Third, innovation in family planning programme design, implementation and monitoring must be encouraged.

Certain pockets of non-governmental organizations like Family Planning Association of Pakistan – Rahnuma, Greenstar Social Marketing and Marie Stopes International have been making sustained contributions in providing family planning services as part of the community uplift programmes in their areas of operation.

According to statistics on the Greenstar website, during the past decade their initiatives have prevented approximately 11,000 maternal deaths, 127,000 child deaths, and a staggering 8 million unintended pregnancies.

But these figures dwarf when compared to the needs of nearly 31 million married women of reproductive age in Pakistan. Unfortunately, these NGOs lack support from the government which has also been a major drawback when it comes to promoting the issue on a national level compared to other programmes i.e. HIV/AIDS, polio and dengue eradication.

In order for Pakistan to achieve its FP2020 objectives, sustained, bold and unequivocal leadership and commitment at all levels of government is needed.

Motherhood is considered a blessing for women, but if the woman dies during pregnancy there is no blessing to celebrate.

Pakistan has tremendous opportunity to regain its earlier momentum and achieve both immediate and long-term objectives related to family planning. It is evident that until and unless population growth is given its due attention, the country will continue to fall short in meeting the needs of its citizens.

The purpose of law is to guide and streamline society within the limits guided by moral judgment and to guard against miscreants and criminals. This may work sometimes, but in most cases, laws have failed or have loopholes to frame others of crimes for their own vested interests. The laws can be faulty in dispensing justice which is either based on the principle of revenge in most cases, circling those involved who are handed over the verdict, sometimes wrongfully with no recourse for the accused to counter the judgment. The laws are ever being evolved to make them better suited for sufferers, but they can never be perfect, for the fault lines are much graver when it comes to punishment bestowed by a lack of evidence.

It is true that not all sentences carried out are wrong, but there is little to the defense of those accused. For example, the Diyat and Qasas laws, the Islamic jurisprudence that allows for the murderer to pay blood money to the family of the victim to go scot free. This law is suitable for well-to-do families but this facility is not for those who cannot afford blood money to be paid to the family of the victim. This law is faulty in the sense that it allows for the murderer to go scot free without any repercussions. This has been observed in the cases of honor killing where killers are pardoned within the family. This is a case of faulty justice as it serves only the rich and influential while punishing those who cannot pay blood money.

The controversial Qisas and Diyat laws were introduced in the 1980’s during Zia’s Islamization as a way to appease the clergy. Under the law, the case of honor killing is considered a civil offence, not a criminal activity, thus patronizing and justifying the killing over alleged adultery. It is because of these laws, it is estimated, that the crime of murder has risen manifold rather than becoming controlled. It is estimated that the conviction rate has dropped dramatically and out of court settlements have increased, meaning justice is not served to the murderers who can go scot free after paying blood money. This law works unfavorably for women who remain helpless in seeking justice, even in death. The cases of compromise have been so high that it is not possible to keep a track of statistics where family members pardoned the perpetrators, usually members of the same household. However, in cases where the families do not want to pardon the murderers, the family can register a complaint in the anti-terror court where the murderer can be indicted. But such cases are very few in Pakistan. There is a crying need for the review of the law to ensure justice for the victims who were murdered in cold blood to settle scores.

The other most heinous law that needs to be reviewed is the Blasphemy Law. Introduced again during the time of Zia ul Haq, this law carries its weight merely on the hearsay of people against those accused of blasphemy. This law was first introduced in 1860 and amended further in 1927 during the British period to avert mob justice and carried sentences for the crime of blasphemy. But this law was further hardened during Zia’s time and carried death sentences for the crimes of blasphemy. The major defect of the law is that anyone can be accused of the crime by mere hearsay and no investigation ever takes place to get to the truth. Worse still, the accuser can easily frame others of blasphemy to settle scores or “cleanse” society of non-muslims, as has been the case with Rimsha Massih, against whom the evidence was fabricated. Luckily, the fabrication of the evidence was proved and Rimsha Massih was acquitted, but she had to flee the country with her family for security reasons as the behavior of clerical mobs cannot be predicted. What is noteworthy in this case is that the cleric who was found to be fabricating evidence has gone scot-free as no action has been taken against him.

The laws against witchcraft in the US centuries ago are a stark reminder of how the invisible crime carried sentences of death. Mere hearsay was enough to send men and women to the gallows. This law has long gone, but it is somewhat synonymous to what we witness in Pakistan today: the blasphemy laws that strip the accused of any defense.

This is the law where those wrongly accused are sentenced for no crime of theirs while the accusers face no repercussions. Any talk of the review of the law has created more trouble and claimed the lives of Salman Taseer, the former Governor of Punjab and Federal Minister Shahbaz Bhatti. No one dares to talk about amending the law, yet the stark injustice is visible to all.

The Qisas and Diyat Laws and Blasphemy Laws need great introspection and review as they are a major source of injustice, creating disharmony and resentment within society. Unless the laws are repealed and replaced by more secular laws, justice can be rightly served with equality and rightfulness. Take the case of the Hudood Ordinance, which did not give any distinction between rape and adultery. This law has been gradually softened by the Women’s Protection Bill and guaranteed protection to women. The same should be introduced for the other unjust laws of Pakistan that have snatched the safeguards of the poor and vulnerable.",['Zeeba T.

ISLAMABAD - The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Friday said that the Holy Quran also does not mandate the punishment of death for the offence of adultery, and if a man suspects his wife of infidelity he should follow the path prescribed by the Holy Quran and the law of Pakistan.

A two-member bench of the apex court comprising Justice Qazi Faez Isa and Justice Sardar Tariq Masood gave these findings in a judgment of a murder case.

A petitioner Muhammad Abbas had killed his wife Mst Saima Bibi stating that she was woman of bad character. Sessions Judge Nankana Sahib awarded petitioner death sentence under Section 302(b) of Pakistan Penal Code.

Abbas challenged the sentence in Lahore High Court (LHC) which upheld his conviction, but reduced his death sentence to life imprisonment.

The petitioner then approached Supreme Court against the LHC verdict. The apex court ,however, dismissed his petition.

The verdict authored by Justice Qazi Faez Isa said that the woman or the girl who is killed in the name or pretext of honour has no chance to redeem her honour. She is deprived of both her life and reputation.

He wrote that the petitioner who professes to be a Muslim did not follow the methodology commanded by Almighty Allah and the law of Pakistan to resolve his suspicions about his wife.

The verdict said that the petitioner then couched his criminal and un-Islamic conduct by stating that he became enraged to see his wife in the company of a man and on account of his ‘ghairat’ he killed her.

“Almighty Allah loves those who amongst others restrain their anger. To become enraged is not an admirable trait nor is ghairat,” said the apex court’s verdict.

The top court of the country noted that Pakistan has one of the highest, if not the highest per capita honour killings in the world and predominantly the victims are women.

The judgment said that by stating that murder was committed on the pretext of ghairat (honour) the murderer hopes to provide some justification for the crime.

It may also elevate the murderer’s social status with those not familiar with what Almighty Allah Commands in the Holy Quran. This is unfortunate, more so because there is no honour in such killings.

Justice Qazi wrote that Parliament was rightly concerned with the prevalence of such killings and enacted legislation to dissuade, if not stop such crimes. It did so by ensuring that offenders do not avail of the benefit of section 302(c) PPC, for which the maximum punishment is 25 years imprisonment but which does not prescribe a minimum punishment.

Parliament specifically stipulated that such crimes attract clause (a) or clause (b) of section 302 PPC, for which the punishment is either death or imprisonment for life, he added.

He said that according to Principle of Policy set out in the Constitution; “The State shall protect the marriage, the family, the mother and the child’.

When women and girls are not protected but rather killed in the name or on the pretext of honour the family is destroyed, he added.

According to the judgment, the two concurrent findings of guilt against the petitioner by the Sessions Judge and LHC are supported by evidence on record which the apex court also independently examined.

There is no reason justifying the grant of leave, which is declined, and, consequently, the petition is dismissed, added the judgment.",['Shahid Rao'],"Share:ISLAMABAD - The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Friday said that the Holy Quran also does not mandate the punishment of death for the offence of adultery, and if a man suspects his wife of infidelity he should follow the path prescribed by the Holy Quran and the law of Pakistan.

The Los Angeles district attorney´s office has received a second sexual assault complaint against Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey, whose acting career has nosedived following allegations by more than a dozen men in the United States and Britain.

""A case of sexual assault was filed yesterday (21/8) in our office by the Los Angeles County Sheriff´s Department, involving Kevin Spacey, and is under review,"" Greg Risling with the prosecutors´ office told AFP Wednesday.

A separate investigation was opened back in April for a complaint about an alleged assault in 1992 involving a man.

Risling did not specify details about this new complaint, or the status of the previous one.

The two-time Academy Award-winner has seen allegations against him pile up on the heels of the #MeToo movement, which began with the fall of Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.

Spacey also has open investigations in London, where he directed The Old Vic Theater between 2004 and 2015, and in Nantucket, an island resort near Boston.

The first report that was made public was that of actor Anthony Rapp, 46, who claimed that the actor sexually abused him at age 14, back in 1986.

Spacey apologised to Rapp, claiming not to remember the incident, but remained silent as accusations against him mushroomed.

One actor anonymously told the Vulture portal that Spacey tried to rape him in 1984, when he was 14 years old.

And eight members of the production team of his popular Netflix series ""House of Cards"" who also denounced ""predatory"" behavior by Spacey.

After first accusations of abuse against him, Spacey was fired in November from the political series. Then he was dumped from his scenes in Ridley Scott´s latest film, ""All the Money in the World,"" where was replaced by Christopher Plummer.",[],"Share:The Los Angeles district attorney´s office has received a second sexual assault complaint against Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey, whose acting career has nosedived following allegations by more than a dozen men in the United States and Britain.

One minor girl died while nine individuals injured as a house collapsed in Hub area of Balochistan as earthquake hit across the country.

Tremors of earthquake felt in Lahore, surrounding areas today.

The PMD, Pakistan stated that quake was measured 6.1 on Richter Scale with depth of 179 Kilometers. The quake had epicenter in Hindukush Mountain Ranger, the department said.

According to media reports, the tremors were felt across the country including Swat, Bannu, Peshawar and other northern areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhuwa.

A school building was collapsed in Peshawar and several children are feared to be injured. The rescue operation has been started.

The officials also dispatched teams in Balochistan and nearby Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to assess reports of damage.

However Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority did not expect serious losses, a spokesman said.

The epicentre was near Afghanistan's Jarm, which was hit by a devastating 7.5 magnitude quake in October 2015 that triggered landslides and flattened buildings, killing more than 380 people across the region.

The bulk of the recorded casualties were in Pakistan, where 248 people were killed, including 202 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and more than 1,600 injured.

Afghanistan is frequently hit by earthquakes, especially in the Hindu Kush mountain range, which lies near the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates.

Aid agencies have stressed the need for greater disaster preparedness in the war-torn country, which remains extremely susceptible to recurring natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes and landslides.

But deteriorating security has seen international NGOs such as the Red Cross and Save the Children downgrade their operations across the country, making it even more difficult to deliver crucial help to its most vulnerable citizens.",['Web Desk'],"Share:One minor girl died while nine individuals injured as a house collapsed in Hub area of Balochistan as earthquake hit across the country.

GAZA - Thousands of angry Palestinian mourners attended on Saturday the funerals of seven Palestinians, including two children, who were shot dead by Israeli gunfire during the protests in the eastern Gaza Strip close to the border with Israel. In each funeral of the seven killed, the mourners took their bodies from the mortuary, while gunmen fired into the air during the procession to their homes.

In the house of Nasser Musabeh, a 12-year-old boy killed in the Friday protests, his families, friends and neighbours received the boy's body with deep grief.

Outside Nasser's house, hundreds of people gathered to offer condolences to the bereaved family. ""What was our fault in order (for Israel) to kill children? Why are they (Israelis) killing children?"" asked 12-year-old Mohamed Ibrahim, one of Nasser's friends.

The Gaza health ministry said on Friday that the Israeli army killed seven Palestinians, including two children under 15, and wounded 506 others, in the Palestinian March of Return rallies.

""The high number of martyrs and injuries yesterday confirms the excessive use of the policy of force (by Israel) against the peaceful demonstrators,"" Abdulatif al-Qanoua, spokesman of Hamas which controls Gaza, said by phone.

KARACHI - The majority of child abuse cases in Pakistan go unreported, according to child protection experts speaking at a seminar Safeguarding Children: Communities, Schools and Online organised by Aga Khan University’s Institute for Educational Development, IED. Even though Pakistan has a range of laws to protect children, poor implementation of regulations alongside a low conviction rate mean that child abuse continues to be a persistent problem in society. Highlighting ways to report child abuse, experts noted the actions parents can take to protect a child. For example, if abuse has occurred and medical help is needed, parents can go to a hospital. They may also inform the police by dialing 15 or call the child protection authority on 1121. Dr Kishwar Enam, lecturer at the department of paediatrics at AKU’s Medical College and president, Child Protection Services, Aga Khan University Hospital, said that around the world seven out of ten cases of child abuse take place at homes (such as the residence of victims or offenders). Dr Enam noted that this figure is likely to be similar in Pakistan but cautioned that underreporting of crimes means that statistics from NGOs and the Sindh government are likely to underestimate the scale of problem. “There are many reasons why cases go unreported,” said Dr Enam. “These include fear of the perpetrator, concerns about being stigmatised by society, economic dependence, inability to recognise child abuse as being improper, poor awareness of ways to complain and lack of trust in the system.” Speakers at the event expressed concern about the growing number of child abuse cases in Pakistan and discussed how neighbourhoods, schools and parents can take steps to reduce the risk of abuse which can happen to children of any race, socioeconomic group, religion or culture.",['Staff Report'],"Share:KARACHI - The majority of child abuse cases in Pakistan go unreported, according to child protection experts speaking at a seminar Safeguarding Children: Communities, Schools and Online organised by Aga Khan University’s Institute for Educational Development, IED.

Narendra Damodardas Modi the 14th Prime Minister (PM) of the world’s largest democracy is a very mysterious individual. Not much is known about his private life and his journey to power. Lives with his mother, was married for a brief period in 1968 to Jashodaben Narendrabhai, her whereabouts are unknown. Claims to have attended Gujarat University in 1983, University of Delhi 1978 and then School of Open Learning University of Delhi. He enrolled as full time RSS worker in 1971 in his home province of Gujarat. In 1985 he was assigned to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) the political wing of this fascist militant outfit. He rose to be the secretary General of BJP in 2001, the same year he replaced the ailing Chief Minister (CM) of Gujarat Keshubhai Patel.

In 2002 Narendra Modi emerged on the world map with the title of ‘Butcher of Gujarat’. As CM of Gujarat he allowed massacre of over 2000 Muslims. For three days the goons of RSS were given a free hand for ethnic cleansing. For his complicity in this crime against humanity he was barred from entering any Western country for over ten years. He remained CM till 2004 before entering the political arena at the centre. Commissions were formed and inquiries were conducted to punish the culprits of the Gujarat carnage but he escaped conviction due to lack of evidence which is a typical failure of common law in high profile cases.

Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was formed in the year 1925 as a ‘National Patriotic Organization to create a fascist Hindu State. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the first PM who had RSS background. Like Modi he too had an interesting life. Never married, perhaps remained celibate like the Catholic priests. He was once asked the reason for his bachelorhood. The answer was quite interesting. He grew up with his elder brother and his wife. His ‘Bhabhi’ (Sister-in-law) was always worried about the safety of her husband. Atal Ji decided that no female should be made to live a worrisome life so he decided to remain single. Unlike Modi he was a statesman and a poet who wanted to build a legacy. He distanced himself from RSS and worked for peace. His famous verse “Hum Jang No Hone Denge’ (We will avoid war at all costs) reverberated at Minar-e-Pakistan during his visit to Lahore.

When Ronald Reagan took oath of office as 40th President of USA it was reported that he was the first divorcee to occupy the White House. The 39 Presidents before him were all family men who had stability in their personal lives. Donald Trump the 45th head of state arrived with his third wife and a teenage son to run the world’s lone Super Power. It seems the world has changed, the standards have been lowered to accommodate ordinary individuals into the corridors of power. It is indeed interesting that Hitler, Vajpayee and now Modi have similar backgrounds, they emerged from grass root politics as single males with no one to consult or guide their daily conduct. Hitler was able to consolidate his power and caused unamendable damage to the world. Vajpayee never got a second term in office despite his claims of ‘Shining India’. Modi is now in his second term in office and in the process of attaining absolute control. Imran Khan is right, the world must be watchful of Modi the Butcher of Gujarat before he causes immeasurable damage to the world.

The ‘Mystery of Modi’ has to be demystified to save humanity before it is too late. The siege of 80 million unarmed Kashmiris is a test case for the world and the international bodies created for peace and human rights. ‘Mysterious Modi’ the Tea Boy and ‘Butcher of Gujarat’ was raised and indoctrinated to destroy not to build. RSS is in his blood, he will need a major transfusion to cleanse his system.

Extensive research has been carried out on the rise and fall of ‘Adolf Hitler’, even movies have been made but it seems no lessons have been learnt. ‘Hitler’ has been demystified but after the damage and destruction that he has caused. The movie on Gandhi was an epic, the one on ‘Modi’ will be a nightmare for the world to watch under the title of, “ The Carnegie of Gujarat” To protect human interests ‘Modi’ should be under the ‘Magnifying Glass’ to watch his inhuman moves. Researches and Think Tanks have to focus on this Hitler of the 21st century., RSS is an extension of the Nazi Party. BJP is just a political façade to create a fascist Hindu state. So far the Tea Boy of Gujarat has been able to deliver on the expectations of his launchers. Arena and scope of his nefarious designs has now been expanded to entire Indian Union. For a population of 80 million in Kashmir he has deployed a million soldiers. A bloodbath may be in the making as pointed out by Imran Khan. The slogan should be to ‘Expose Modi’ a fascist phenomena of the 20th century dominated by Nazism and Adolf Hitler whose road map he has followed to the teeth. Appeasement did not work then, it will not work now. History should not be allowed to repeat itself. Through ‘Modi’, Hitler has entered the 21st century, his tracks have to be blocked to save the world. From Kashmir the message is,

“We will be destroyed before the world understands our plight”.",['Dr Farid A Malik'],"Claims to have attended Gujarat University in 1983, University of Delhi 1978 and then School of Open Learning University of Delhi.

A scandal pertaining to child abuse surfaced in Taunsa Sharif district of Dera Ghazi Khan, the native area of Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, on Saturday.

It has been revealed that the suspect is blackmailing the families of the children through their pornography videos. The affectees have claimed that the accused Adnan Zafar is threatening them for reconciliation while showing them his photograph with the Punjab CM.

They have alleged that the suspect made videos of at least 19 children and also took extortion money from them. Moreover, the father of Adnan is serving in Punjab police force. On the complaint of the families, police took action and has registered a case against the incident.

Kasur had last attained local and international notoriety last year when the incident of rape and murder of six-year-old Zainab Amin came to light. It was the 12th such incident to occur within a 10 kilometre radius in Kasur in one year and had sparked outrage and protests across the country.

In February 2017, an anti-terrorism court handed down death penalty to Imran Ali on four counts after he was found guilty of rape and murder of Zainab and six other minor girls. A fine of one million rupees was also slapped on the convict alongside a sum of one million as blood money.

He was later hanged in the Kot Lakhpat Jail Lahore on October 17 last year.

Later in February 2018, ATC acquitted at least 12 men of child sex abuse and blackmail charges in Kasur in a massive paedophilia scandal that rocked the country in August 2015.

The abuse and extortion scandal, which authorities have called the largest in Pakistan’s history, allegedly involved hundreds of victims in Punjab province.

Two of the accused were jailed for life in April 2017. In the village of Hussain Khanwala in Kasur, southwest of Lahore, videos were made of at least 280 children being sexually abused by a gang who blackmailed their parents by threatening to leak the videos.

The police, who had conspicuously failed to act despite pleas from some parents, eventually made dozens of arrests after clashes between relatives and authorities brought the issue into the media spotlight.

In March 2016, Senate also passed a bill that criminalised sexual assault against minors, child pornography and trafficking for the first time -- previously only the acts of rape and sodomy were punishable by law.",[],"Share:A scandal pertaining to child abuse surfaced in Taunsa Sharif district of Dera Ghazi Khan, the native area of Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, on Saturday.

WASHINGTON - The US Department of Education on Friday changed its guidelines for university sexual assault investigations and dropped recommended standards from the previous administration that critics said could be discriminatory.

This guidance on sexual assault probes took effect in 2011 during the Barack Obama administration to help universities fight the widespread problem. It instructed schools to use a ""preponderance of evidence"" standard.

The old guidelines came up against considerable resistance from universities, many of which complained of increased pressures on investigative procedures. Legal experts also pointed to the lack of fairness between the accused and the accuser.

President Donald Trump's administration has maintained that using a lower standard of proof in sexual misconduct cases in fact suggests a discriminatory aim.

The new guidance allows schools to choose a standard of proof consistent with the standard the school applies in other student misconduct cases.

More than one in five students in US universities are victims of an unwanted sexual act, surveys show. But students rarely report the crimes to authorities or to their universities.

In 2015, California passed a law called ""Yes, means yes"", prompting institutions to focus their investigations more on the issue of sexual consent than on the evidence of rape.

Eleven women accused Trump, a developer and reality television star with no prior political experience, of sexual harassment in the last weeks of the presidential race.

Pakistan suffers from customs like Vani whereby girls are forcibly married to a family as part of a punishment for a crime committed by male members of their family.

The issue of forced marriages does not only exist in far-off rural areas but also in urban areas. Girls are married against their will due to one reason or another.

Moreover, this custom affects people within all around the world. Many Pakistanis, who are settled in foreign countries, marry their sons and daughters against their will to members of their family in Pakistan for various purposes, to help get members of their family citizenship of the foreign country they reside in.

A news report published in BBC Urdu has said that Pakistan ranks at the top when it comes to forced marriages between British citizens and citizens of other countries.

The report said that facts and figures quoted by the British government highlight that in 2016, the greatest number of forced marriages occurred between Pakistani and British citizens.

According to the data provided by the British government, the number of forced marriages between Pakistani and British citizens is abnormally higher than those between citizens of Britain and other countries.

In 2016, among the forced marriages between citizens of Britain and the rest of the world, 43 percent of the incidents took place in Pakistan.

According to the report, the British Interior Ministry and Foreign Ministry formed a ‘Forced Marriage Unit’ to deal with and monitor this issue. The date provided by the Forced Marriage Unit said that in 2016, the total number of incidents of forced marriage between British citizens and citizens of other countries of the world totaled 1,428.

The Forced Marriage Unit also stated that last year, with regards to Pakistan, 612 forced marriages and attempted forced marriages occurred, followed by Bangladesh with 121 cases, India with 79 cases, Somalia with 47 cases, Afghanistan with 39 cases and Saudi Arabia with 16 cases.

Furthermore, in 2016, 157 cases of forced marriage between British and Pakistani citizens were such that the forced marriage occurred in Britain.

In 2016, in the case of Pakistan, out of the total cases of forced marriage, 1,145 were women while 283 were men. 371 cases were such that the affected person was less than 18 years of age.

According to the British government, forced marriage is defined as one in which one or both parties are forced to marry under physical or mental torture or under financial threats.",[],"The issue of forced marriages does not only exist in far-off rural areas but also in urban areas.

KARACHI - A number of commuters remained stuck up on superhighway for hours during a protest by residents of Gadap Town against the killing of a teenager in crossfire between police and drug peddlers on Saturday.

A massive traffic jam was witnessed on main superhighway on Saturday afternoon when a large number of people, including family members and neighbours of a teenager who lost his life during an exchange of fire between policemen and drugs dealers staged a protest on the national artery.

The protesters brought the body of the teenager with them and blocked the main superhighway by putting up barricades on the road and setting tyres on fire, causing a massive traffic jam.

The protesters went violent when the police after getting information about the protest reached the scene and tried to disperse them. The protesters attacked the police with stones as well as a large number of protesters attacked Gadap City police station with stones.

Keeping the intense situation in view, extra contingents of law enforcers were called at the protest site as well as police station to disperse the protesters. The police also used teargas shells and charged the protesters with batons in order to disperse them. This angered the protesters and turned them more violent.

However, the police high ups took notice of the incident. Additional IG Dr Ameer Sheikh took notice of the killing of the teenager, formed an inquiry committee under the supervision of Zone East police chief DIG Amir Farooqui, stating him to probe the matter. Additional IG Karachi also ordered registration of the case if police are involved.

NEW DELHI - Allegations a young engineer was kidnapped and made to marry at gunpoint are being investigated by police in one of India’s poorest states, which has a history of forced marriage of men.

Video footage apparently showing Vinod Kumar being forced to go through with a wedding by his bride’s family sparked the probe, police in the eastern state of Bihar said Friday.

‘Pakadua Vivah’ (forced marriage) is a practice specific to Bihar and surrounding areas, and is mainly carried out by poor families who cannot afford a dowry - still a widespread expectation in India. A video circulated on social media shows the engineer being manhandled and forced to dress for the wedding as he pleads for freedom.

“We are only performing your wedding, not hanging you,” one man is heard to shout as Kumar begs to be released.

Another video shows Kumar sitting beside his bride crying while a woman, apparently an in-law, tries to console him.

Lalan Mohan Prasad, a local officer, told AFP police had contacted Kumar and offered their help but he had not formally complained.

Local media quoted the engineer as saying one of the bride’s relatives had pointed a pistol at him after they met at a mutual friend’s wedding and ordered him to marry her.

Since the incident, he has reportedly escaped and returned to his home in neighbouring Jharkhand state.

Bihar has a long-held reputation for lawlessness and gang violence, with families thought to enlist organised criminals to help them carry out abductions and forced marriages.

Local social scientist Saibal Gupta said such marriages enjoyed widespread acceptance and tended to endure, given the stigma of divorce.

“The frequency of such kidnappings has come down, but certainly not stopped. Poverty is still rampant,” he told AFP.

Official figures show police received nearly 3,000 complaints of groom kidnapping in 2016. None of the marriages were annulled.",[],"Share:NEW DELHI - Allegations a young engineer was kidnapped and made to marry at gunpoint are being investigated by police in one of India’s poorest states, which has a history of forced marriage of men.

Expressing concern over persistent reports of serious human rights violations and abuses in Ethiopia's Tigray region, the UN human rights chief said Thursday there is an urgent need for an objective and independent assessment of facts on the ground.

Michelle Bachelet, the high commissioner for human rights, said her office had received information about ongoing fighting across the region, particularly in the center of Tigray region, as well as incidents of looting by ""various armed actors.""

""Deeply distressing reports of sexual and gender-based violence, extrajudicial killings, widespread destruction and looting of public and private property by all parties continue to be shared with us, as well as reports of continued fighting in central Tigray in particular,"" said Bachelet in a statement.

""Credible information also continues to emerge about serious violations of international human rights law and humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict in Tigray in November last year.""

She said that without prompt, impartial, and transparent investigations and holding those responsible accountable, she feared violations would continue ""with impunity,"" and the situation will remain volatile for a long time.

The rights office said it has information about the killing of eight protestors by security forces on Feb. 9-10 in Adigrat, Mekelle, Shire, and Wukro.

Sexual violence

More than 136 cases of rape have also been reported in hospitals in Mekelle, Ayder, Adigrat, and Wukro in the east of the Tigray region between December and January, said the office.

It said there are indications that there are many more such unreported cases.

""The government has said investigations are underway into the cases of sexual violence,"" said the rights office, adding it had information about indiscriminate shelling in the Tigray towns of Mekelle, Humera, and Adigrat in November.

It also had reports of grave human rights violations and abuses, including mass killings by armed forces from the neighboring country of Eritrea in Axum and Dengelat in central Tigray.

""A preliminary analysis of the information received indicates that serious violations of international law, possibly amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity, may have been committed by multiple actors in the conflict,"" said the office.

These include the Ethiopian National Defense Forces, the Tigray People's Liberation Front, Eritrean armed forces, and Amhara regional forces and affiliated militia.

""With multiple actors in the conflict, blanket denials, and finger-pointing, there is a clear need for an objective, independent assessment of these reports – victims and survivors of these violations must not be denied their rights to the truth and justice,"" said Bachelet.

""We urge the government of Ethiopia to grant my office, and other independent monitors access to the Tigray region, with a view to establishing the facts and contributing to accountability, regardless of the affiliation of perpetrators,"" she said.

Threat to journalists

The UN rights chief also expressed concern at detentions this week in Tigray of journalists and translators working for local and international media.

While the journalists have been released, the office said there have been worrying remarks by a government official that those responsible for ""misleading international media"" would be held accountable.

The Tigray region has been the scene of fighting since November when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced military operations against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), who he accused of attacking federal army camps.

Government troops took control of the regional capital, Mekele, in late November, but the TPLF vowed to fight, and clashes have persisted in the Horn of Africa country, hampering efforts to deliver humanitarian aid.",[],"Share:Expressing concern over persistent reports of serious human rights violations and abuses in Ethiopia's Tigray region, the UN human rights chief said Thursday there is an urgent need for an objective and independent assessment of facts on the ground.

Shah Hussain, who stabbed law student Khadija Siddiqui 23 times in Lahore in May 2016, was arrested on Wednesday after the Supreme Court overturned the Lahore High Court (LHC) order regarding his acquittal.

A three-member bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Asif Saeed Khosa heard Khadija's appeal against the LHC's (LHC) acquittal of her attacker and classmate Shah Hussain.

While declaring LHC's acquittal of Shah Hussain as null and void, the top court ordered Shah Hussain's arrest and upheld a decision of a sessions court to sentence him to five years in prison.

As the hearing went under way, CJP Khosa was informed that suspect Shah Hussain was present in court. Justice Khosa remarked, “We want to see whether the LHC’s conclusion was in accordance with the evidence.”

Khadija’s lawyer then told the bench, “The LHC did not see the complete evidence present in the case. Khadija’s sister also appeared as a witness.""

The lawyer of the law student continued, “Shah Hussain was Khadija’s classmate and stabbed her 23 times. He even attacked her twice on her neck. According to doctors, Khadija was bleeding when she was brought to the hospital.”

Justice Khosa observed, “Khadija knew the suspect but he was named five days after the incident took place.”

At this, Khadija’s lawyer said that she was not in her senses at the time of the attack. “She had even termed the doctors as strangers,” the lawyer said.

“Shah Hussain planned and only attacked Khadija,” the lawyer continued.

Stating that Khadija’s sister also “delayed naming the suspect”, the chief justice said, “They both were law students, now we should practice law.”

“The most important question is why did Shah Hussain want to kill Khadija? Was this question put on record?” Justice Khosa asked.

“The suspect had a lot of chances to kill. Why did he decide to kill in a crowded area and was this point brought on record?” the chief justice further questioned.

“Stabbings can be a result of provocations, if the boy was interested in the girl then why did he want to kill her?” he added.

Khadija’s lawyer responded, “It is on record that they both were very close to each other. Seven months before the attempted killing, they both ended the relationship.”

“Shah Hussain kept insisting and Khadija kept rejecting. This is a case of insistence and rejection,” the lawyer upheld. “Khadija gained conscience five days after the attack and immediately named Shah Hussain as the suspect.”

The chief justice added that the “recovery memo states that a helmet and two hair were found”. “Was a DNA conducted of the hair?” the chief justice asked.

Khadija’s lawyer responded, “Police said that they sent the hair to the forensic lab but they did not receive it.”

Justice Khosa remarked, “In such cases there are two conditions – one is if not mine then no one’s and the other is that the girl might have something that can be used to blackmail the boy.”

The chief justice further questioned, “Did the prosecution also request to suspend LHC’s decision?”

Khadija’s lawyer then said, “Any decision by the court is acceptable to us other than forwarding the matter to the high court.”

On defence counsel Khalid Ranjha’s request, the chief justice granted Shah Hussain two minutes to present his arguments. “I was nominated because I refused to marry and ended the relationship,” Shah Hussain said. “Khadija expressed reservations over the letters that were sent to me for cross-examination,” he added.

“The prosecution attempted to portray me as a ‘desperate person’,” the suspect further said.

Khadija, who is currently studying in the United Kingdom and arrived in Islamabad earlier this week to attend the hearing, told the court, “Shah Hussain used to emotionally blackmail me.”

When the chief justice asked Khadija regarding the statement she gave to the doctors, the law student replied, “I remember very little and can’t even recall whether I spoke at all or not.”

“I did not even know whether I am alive or not,” she added.

Earlier, on May 3, 2016, Khadija was stabbed 23 times by Shah Hussain, her classmate on Lahore’s Davis Road.

On July 29, Lahore judicial magistrate sentenced Hussain to seven years in prison, however, on June 4, the Lahore High Court acquitted Hussain.

Despite having numerous unsettled questions about the working model for Pakistan, the entire nation unanimously accepts that the state was formed as a laboratory of Islam where the principles and teachings of Islam could be implemented in letter and spirit. However, with the passage of time, our people and rulers have unlearned the basic teaching of Islam taught to us by the Quran and Holy Prophet (PBUH) i.e. it disapproves of any sort of coercion in the matters related to religion altogether and respects human free will. The founding fathers of Pakistan were very clear about the matters related to state-religion and advocated the freedom to follow religion for every citizen. However, the state created in the name of Islam which is house to almost 207 million people out of which Hindus and Christians collectively comprise 3.1 percent of the total population is under the threat of forced conversions and religious extremism. In Pakistan, the majority of the Hindu population (i.e. 6.8 million) animates in the Sindh province owing to its cultural and historical affiliation with the region. And this is where this brutal practice is being carried out by the so called propagators of the religion.

Recently, the US has declared Pakistan as a country of ‘particular concern’ for having involved in/or accepted systematic ongoing and egregious violation of religious freedom. According to the report published by US Commission on International Religious Freedom, Pakistan failed in fortifying its minorities and guaranteeing religious freedom. The ministry of foreign affairs in Pakistan has declared this label as ‘arbitrary and unilateral’ for selectively targeting some countries while ignoring the rest. However, the statistics quoting the number of incidences of forced conversions to Islam show a different picture altogether. According to a report by South Asia partnership-Pakistan and Aurat Foundation, at least one thousand Hindu girls in Pakistan are kidnapped, forcibly converted and married off to their kidnappers every year. Similar data has been reported by the University of Birmingham’s Lawyer Amarnath Motumal of the HRCP. His report informed that no less than 20 Hindu girls are kidnapped and proselytised every month in Pakistan.

Ironically, Pakistan is a signatory of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and has ratified the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which clearly endorses the right of every woman to enter into marriage ‘only with their free and full consent’ but the present situation of the Hindu women in Pakistan clearly shows the ugly side of the picture. Pakistan is badly failing in achieving her commitments under these contracts and saving her minorities from forced conversions and marriages. There are a number of factors that make the Hindu community in Sindh more prone to forced conversions than the rest of the country. These factors include their stark socio-economic conditions, strong missionary zeal for conversion, lack of access to justice, failure of the Sindh criminal law (protection of minorities) bill, inadequate legislation on the registration of Hindu marriages, etc.

In our in-egalitarian society, there exists huge inequality where a class of society enjoys a privileged status and liberty while others even struggle for recognition of their basic rights. The lack of financial empowerment makes the poverty-ridden Hindu population particularly at risk of proselytisation. Similarly, the conservative clergy portrays forced conversion analogous to ‘hajj-e-Akbar’ that will bring rewards in akhirat (hereafter), irrespective of the methods employed to achieve the course of conversion. Extremist Clerics like Mian Mitho and Ayub Jan Sarhandi have become renowned veritable ciphers of proselytisation in Sindh who manipulate their followers to employ every means possible to ‘confirm their tickets to paradise’. Also, minor Hindu girls choose conversion as a means to realize their aspirations of a better life and put an end to their miserable existence.

There are a number of steps that must be taken by the government to protect the rights of minorities in Sindh in particular and Pakistan in general. The Sindh Criminal Law (Protection of Minorities) Bill which could not be passed as the house with 171 members were held hostage by a bunch of religious zealots should be passed to make it a Law across the country. This can be achieved by promoting a national level dialogue Engaging clergy and the general public to avoid further conversions and create inter-faith harmony in the society by tackling human rights abuse. Judicial and police system should be reformed for fast response to the matters related to proselytisation. The government should also ruminate over launching Provincial Commissions for minorities to take up forced conversion and forced marriage cases and guarantee religious minorities’ access to education, jobs, and government positions through passing anti-discriminatory laws.

In conclusion, every state has the responsibility of protecting its people from individuals and organizations that try to convert people by resorting to coercion or exploitation of the particular vulnerability of people. The government of Pakistan has an obligation to ascertain that forced conversions do not occur in the milieu of marriage or marriage negotiations which can be achieved by including people in the process of national development irrespective of their religion and creed. It is high time our people should learn the lesson that it’s their behaviour, not religion that makes them better humans.",['Asma Nisar'],"However, the statistics quoting the number of incidences of forced conversions to Islam show a different picture altogether.

Through a notification circulating on Twitter, it appears that the University of Balochistan will be making uniforms mandatory for students starting March 1, 2020.

The notification, circulated by the Undergraduate Studies Office states: ""Strict compliance to all students (boys/girls) admitted in BS/Masters Study Programmes, the wearing of student's uniform, available at Mother Care, Jinnah Road, Quetta, shall be mandatory.""

Adding that: ""After March 1, 2020 no student (boy/girl) will be allowed to enter into the university premises without wearing the prescribed uniform and will be entertained for any reason,"" the statement added.

The university's vice chancellor, Dr Javed Iqbal, recently became embroiled in nationwide controversy when it emerged that the university administration was blackmailing students for interacting on campus. Apparently, using surveillance footage around the campus, female students who were found interacting with male students on campus were told that unless they paid hefty fines to the university administration, their parents would be notified of their behavior.

The bizarre and illegal policing resulted in protests by university students in Quetta, and also expressions of solidarity in Islamabad, Karachi, and Lahore. It was only after protests that Dr Javed Iqbal agreed to step down for an impartial judicial inquiry into what the university administration had been illegally pursuing.

As Quetta is a conservative city, authorities are trying to evaluate whether the university administration was putting the lives of these students at stake by threatening to inform parents.

This case came at a time many Pakistani universities experienced a wave of protests against the policing of opposite-sex interaction. It seems the University of Balochistan is still, in applying a uniform that it believes will maintain inter-gender decorum, applying the belief that male and female students - and all casual interactions between them - must be strictly controlled and scrutinized.

""Universities should be spaces of learning, not surveillance. Students should be treated with respect, not as criminals to be controlled and contained,"" Dr Nida Kirmani, a professor of sociology at the Lahore University of Management Sciences tweeted.

If the policy of uniforms is applied, the University of Balochistan may become one of the country's only co-educational government institutes that imposes specific uniforms on male and female students.

A senate committee has already been formed to address the crisis, and to investigate the extent to which members of the university administration are culpable in charges of harassment and blackmail.",['Web Desk'],"Share:Through a notification circulating on Twitter, it appears that the University of Balochistan will be making uniforms mandatory for students starting March 1, 2020.

TEXAS-Two teenage boys were hoping to make a deal with the devil when they killed a 15-year-old suburban Houston girl in a satanic ritual, a prosecutor said.

Seventeen-year-old Jose Reyes and a 16-year-old are accused of carving an upside-down crucifix on her stomach. Reyes and the boy, whose name is not being released because he is a juvenile, each face a capital murder charge for the death of Corriann Cervantes.

Authorities say that after the boys lured Cervantes to a vacant apartment in southeastern Houston on February 5, they hit her with an ashtray and toilet tank lid and stabbed her in the face with a screwdriver. Reyes, who was arrested on Sunday, made a brief court appearance on Tuesday. He is being held without bond. Harris county prosecutor John Jordan said that at one point during the assault, Cervantes yelled out to them: “Why are you doing this to me?” “The juvenile inquired that if he committed a murder, would that basically initiate him into being able to sell his soul to the devil, of which Mr Reyes said: ‘Yes,”‘ Jordan said.

400 videos of 280 children being forced to take part in sexual acts were discovered recently in Kasur, Pakistan. They were abused and then the parents of the victims were subjected to blackmail, while DVDs of the videos were sold rampantly at Rs. 50 in shops. Most of the kids were under 14.

The country has shown shock and demands that the culprits be brought to justice – for now at least. Things are certainly moving along and 7 criminals as of yet, have already been arrested.

This is the current devastating event that we Pakistanis are all interested in for now. Sadly, just the like Peshawar school attack and like every other such horrific incident, this too, will be forgotten in time. After we have made our statuses on Facebook showing how upset we are, we will forget, perhaps when the next big tragic news comes up or when we have to go watch the latest movie in the theatre.

I am hopeful that this time I will be proved wrong.

However, comments have already commenced to belittle and create doubt regarding what those poor children went through. A lawyer came on TV and called the DVDs of the abused kids ‘science fiction.’ I don’t know whether to tell him to pick up a dictionary or to tell him that he is sick in the head.

Many are diminishing the horror by saying it happens everywhere in the world.

A politician lambasted the media for making too much noise about this and thus making Pakistan look bad. Do these politicians not realize that it is they who make Pakistan look bad? It is the people actually doing things like this who make Pakistan look bad, not the people reporting it. The police whose job is to protect the people themselves are involved and covering up crime – they make the country look bad. Not the people outing them.

Sweeping dirt under the carpet is just that. The dirt doesn’t go, it is still very much there. No matter what flowers, decorations and pictures you put on top of the carpet, the dirt is still there.

Having said that, do we ever think about what led to this? Why people who commit such crimes keep doing them without fear or a giving a damn? We are to blame too. To a huge extent.

Child abuse is more rampant than we realize and even in the cases when the family finds out, they do nothing especially if the victim is a girl – because honor.

Always the honor bug.

‘Who will marry the girl if they find out what happened when she was young’ is what goes through the mind of these honor-loving parents. These families don’t realize the shame is the culprit’s, not the child’s who was abused.

Whatever happened is quickly hushed, completely ignoring the fact that abused children grow up with many enduring effects on both neurobiological and psychological development. Depression, anxiety, eating disorders, phobias, antisocial behavior, multiple personalities, suicidal tendencies are just some of what the child may be hit with as he grows older without any kind of help or therapy.

How many of us are aware of ‘Bacha baazi’ which goes on unchecked? How many times have we seen a documentary about it and read about it and have shown our disgust, cursed the people, and then gone on with what we were doing? Some even justify it by saying it is part of their culture.

What kind of ‘fine’ culture thrives on abusing kids? How many such children are beaten, touched inappropriately by strange men while they are dancing, raped, made to do things they don’t want to, video-taped, etc? I am guessing the number is much higher than 280. So why are we silent about that? Why do we let it happen?

How many times have we seen little kids on the streets being hit, pushed and bullied by an older person/people. I am fairly certain many of those kids are abused and raped too. What do we do when we see them? Some give money to shut them up, while others reprimand them for getting too close to the car. Sometimes we even pretend to not see them and completely ignore them like they don’t exist. A few do feel sad for them at times and say “Becharay” but we never quite feel bad enough to do something about it.

The extremely God-fearing conscious ones – now those are one of a kind. They come on Facebook and post pictures of sad tragedies, etc and say “1 like equals 50 prayers, if you ignore you are heartless” and they think their job/good deed of the day is done.

I am very sure those 400 prayers or 8 likes travel swiftly at the speed of light straight up to God, but I don’t think it makes much difference to the victims themselves. Unless of course what happens to the victims is magically reversed and/or new harsh laws suddenly appear that severely punish the abusers.

I think not.

So when we think about what happened to those poor kids in Kasur, we are all to blame. We do nothing. And it is partially because of that; people do such things without fear of being caught. If anything, they are protected.

We wait for God to handle it or for other people to stand up to make a difference while we sit and watch the news and pretend to be devastated. When to us, it is nothing but news and just something to talk about. We forget about everything every single time so nothing changes, ever. Heck, we even forget the minute we change the channel.

We post scenic pictures of our country, beautiful places, flowers and feel very proud that this is our country as we should be, but all the while forgetting that dirt that still lays below the carpet.",['Shamila Ghyas'],"A politician lambasted the media for making too much noise about this and thus making Pakistan look bad.

A mother who duped her daughter into travelling to Pakistan to enter a forced marriage was sentenced on Wednesday to four-and-a-half years in prison, following the first successful prosecution of its kind in Britain.

The woman was found guilty on Tuesday following a trial at Birmingham Crown Court, in central England, where a jury heard how the girl sobbed as she was wedded to a male relative 16 years her senior.

""You had cruelly deceived her. She was frightened, alone, held against her will, being forced into a marriage she dreaded,"" said Judge Patrick Thomas QC in sentencing.

""You have sought to blame her for everything, and yourself have accepted responsibility for nothing.""

The girl was forced to marry the same man who had taken her virginity and left her pregnant on an earlier trip to Pakistan.

Then aged 13, she underwent an abortion on returning to Britain.

Concerns over the girl's welfare were allayed by her mother, who cannot be named to protect the identity of her daughter.

She said the pregnancy was a result of ""two teenagers who had sneakily had sex"", according to prosecutors.

Jurors heard how as the girl approached her 18th birthday she was tricked by her mother into returning to Pakistan on what she was told would be a family holiday.

The couple were then married in September 2016 despite objections from the girl, before she was returned to Britain with the assistance of the Home Office. Her mother was arrested in January 2017.

She was convicted of deceiving a victim into travelling abroad to enter into a false marriage - the first conviction of its kind - as well as other forced marriage and perjury charges.

It was found the defendant had lied about the incident in Britain's High Court, where she was summonsed when concerns were raised by authorities.

The new offence of forced marriage came into effect in June 2014, but prosecutions have been rare.

However the Forced Marriage Unit - a joint effort by the foreign and interior ministries - provided support to about 1,200 potential cases in 2017, a government spokesman said, making Britain a ""world leader"" in tackling the problem.",[],"Share:A mother who duped her daughter into travelling to Pakistan to enter a forced marriage was sentenced on Wednesday to four-and-a-half years in prison, following the first successful prosecution of its kind in Britain.

Violence and discrimination against women is an alarming issue in Pakistan and globally. This restricts not only women’s basic rights and participation in society, but also the democratic, economic and social development of those societies. Strengthening women’s access to justice is the key for a prosperous Pakistan.

One way of doing this is to increase the awareness and implementation of Pakistan’s laws on violence against women. If more women and men knew about the existing legal framework more could claim the rights and support mechanisms that the law guarantees them.

For example, various articles of the Constitution of Pakistan give protection to the citizens against violence of any kind. These articles include: Article 4 (rights of individuals to enjoy the protection of law), Article 8 (fundamental rights), Article 25 (equality before the law), Article 27 (no discrimination on the basis of sex alone) and Article 34 (full participation of women in national life).Pakistan has also made considerable progress by passing laws for safeguarding the rights of women. This includes the Prevention of Anti Women Practices law, which recognizes practices of acid violence, forced marriage and ‘honour killings’ as criminal acts; the Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention (Amendment) law; the Protection against Harassment of Women at Workplace Act; the Punjab Protection of Women against Violence Act 2016; the Women in Distress and Detention Fund Act 2010; the Sindh Domestic Violence Act 2013 and Balochistan’s Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act.

The government also offers legal support mechanisms to female victims of violence. The Federal Ministry of Human Rights has prepared a Plan of Action on Human Rights, in which the protection of women’s rights is a major focal point, and manages a toll-free helpline (1099) for victims of human rights violations such as violence against women. Moreover, the National and Provincial Commissions on the Status of Women actively work to protect the rights of women, of which one example is the toll-free helpline (1043) of the Punjab Commission on the Status of Women (PCSW). On the ground, there are also innovative initiatives such as the one-stop Violence Against Women Center (VAWC) established in Multan earlier this year with plans to establish special courts for hearing cases of crimes against women throughout the province of Punjab.

We have just observed the yearly 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence (GBV), a time when women’s rights receive more visibility through the activities of Pakistan’s civil society organizations and men and women working for human rights. It is an opportunity to sensitize larger segments of society about gender equality and pro-women laws. But just as violence against women unfortunately will not stop with the end of the 16 Days of Activism on December 10, so our efforts to prevent it must continue and increase every day.

Because despite positive developments as those mentioned above, the number of cases of honour killing, rape, acid attacks and kidnappings against women reported every year remains alarmingly high, and domestic violence is to a great extent a socially accepted practice in Pakistan. Physical, sexual or psychological abuse in a relationship is often considered as private household matters, and in many cases the police view domestic violence as private affairs and discourage women victims from taking legal action against family members. Meanwhile, the level of reporting and rate of convictions for crimes against women is very low. This means that many Pakistani women, particularly the poor and marginalized, continue to be excluded from the justice system, which is detrimental to Pakistan’s Rule of Law and societal development.

There is an opportunity, however, to transform this situation and place women’s rights at the core of the justice system. Awareness is the first step towards securing those rights. Firstly, key stakeholders from all parts of society should therefore jointly reach out to the public regarding women’s rights and the laws and support available for female victims of violations. Secondly, there is a need for efforts towards greater sensitization on gender equality and on the importance of implementing national and provincial pro-women laws within the law enforcement and judiciary. Thirdly, legislators need to continue to strengthen laws and the regulatory framework at all levels of society to deliver equality before the law to the women of Pakistan.

The EU Delegation, the Embassy of Sweden, UN Women and PODA have joined hands to promote women’s access to justice through the documentary play SEVEN, which aims to continue its tour in Pakistan in 2018. Through this project, Pakistani politicians, bureaucrats, police officers, activists, artists and athletes have engaged to fight violence against women. We now ask you to join as well, and put forward an even more concerted effort in accelerating progress towards achieving justice for half of Pakistan’s population – its women and girls.

As part of the SEVEN project a social media campaign was launched to raise awareness of access to justice for women. Please use the following hashtags to follow or join our campaign:

The Punjab government has vowed to end gender stereotypes this year by giving pink scooters to women. The announcement came after a hundred and fifty women participated in a motorcycle rally in Lahore as part of an empowerment project called Women on Wheels.

Here is what the people of Lahore think about it:

“So they’re giving pink scooters to women who will go out alone. It seems only fair then that they also give blue motorcycles to the men who harass them.” – Naughty Nadeem (human resource manager and video game enthusiast)

- “Pink scooters! That is an excellent way to mark the death of pop legend David Bowie. Now the most critical question is, what color will their helmets be?” – Shabnam Shirarty (beautician and dry cleaner)

- “I’m very glad now my wife will now be able to empathise with my road rage. She keeps telling me to ignore people and drive on. Let’s see how many people she can ignore before she gets angry and starts a physical fight with one of them.” – Lateef Lighter (executive chairman of human resource infrastructure development at private wireless engagement company)

- “We might need a few more flyovers and underpasses in Lahore because the traffic is just about to double. And good luck breathing!” –Daniyal Donor (development professional and freelance photographer)

- “The rally was fun, but the seminar before the rally was really boring. I appeal to the chief minister of Punjab, Chief Justice of Lahore high court, and the president of Pakistan not to allow innocent citizens to be forced to listen to seminars and lectures.” – Anonymous participant

- “Does that mean I will now do all the work at home, and then also be expected to run all the errands outside of home? Sure. Can I exchange my husband with a pink scooter?” – Zaibunnisa Zombie (housewife and part-time magician)

- “I don’t know about everyone else but I’m certainly okay with less women being killed in the name of honor and more women dying in traffic accidents.” – Bahadur Khan (doctor and part-time mobile-phone repairman)

- “It does help to have false sense of safety every now and then, especially when you’re on the street alone. But this should not turn into a sense of entitlement or a demand for more protection.” Billu Bulldozer (tea boy and amateur wrestler)

- “Yes! This is the best thing the government could do to prevent crimes against women.” – Kashif Kainchi (women’s tailor and part-time car mechanic)

- “Can a man ride a pink motorcycle? I’m willing to pay for the vehicle and expect no protection from harassment and name calling.” – Teetu Tamatar (librarian and part-time assistant archives manager)

- “Liberals on motorcycles? This will cause a sharp increase in incidents of drive-by offence-taking.” – Tidda Tandoori (founding member of Truck Drivers at Dhabas)

- “The scooter will at least give me an opportunity to quickly leave uncomfortable situations of street harassment directed at me because of my actual or perceived gender. But I do wish there was an easier way of getting empowered. I know men will eventually learn to accept women in public spaces. But during this education period, I don’t want to be the guinea pig.” – Sameena Sciencedaan (housewife)

- “I’m not a woman, but if I were, I’d wait until a government has shown how seriously it takes the protection of women in the streets before I take their pink motorcycle and start commuting alone.” – Maulana Mushkook (rickshaw driver and part-time political analyst)

- “I’m okay with women going out and driving scooters on their own, as long as they don’t have the freedom to decide where they go and who they meet. That should be my prerogative.” –Rana Rungbaaz (Railway engineer and stay-at-home dad)

- “It is my conviction that this move will help challenge gender stereotypes. Just you wait and see! Women will drive their motorcycles as recklessly as men, always in the wrong lane, holding their mobile phones between their shoulder and their ear.” –Hairan Khan (men’s rights activist and part-time women’s rights activist)

- “I still think Twitter was a better option, where women could get empowered in the safety of their homes, while also learning some cooking, cleaning and astrology tips.” –Chacha Chokanna (social media enthusiast and stay-at-home grandfather)",['Harris Bin Munawar'],"Share:The Punjab government has vowed to end gender stereotypes this year by giving pink scooters to women.

Guy JACKSON - Francois Fillon, the man tipped to win the French rightwing presidential nomination on Sunday, is a free-market reformer, devout Catholic and motor sport fan who has promised to transform France.

Fillon, 62, has professed admiration for Britain’s 1980s prime minister Margaret Thatcher and vowed to slash public spending to shrink the French state. “You have to tear the house down to properly rebuild it,” he has said.

His runaway victory in the first round of the centre-right Republicans party primary last Sunday was revenge on his former boss, ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy.

Sarkozy, who crashed out in third place, had once dismissed Fillon as a “Mr Nobody” when he served as Sarkozy’s prime minister from 2007 to 2012. But the man who himself admitted in a TV interview he had a “boring image” has emerged as the right’s best hope to reconquer power after five years of Socialist rule.

The winner of Sunday’s primary run-off will become the favourite for next year’s presidential election in May where he will likely face - and polls say beat - Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front (FN).

With the backing of influential fellow Republicans leaders and favourable polls, Fillon has the momentum heading into Sunday’s vote to clinch the nomination against rival candidate Alain Juppe, 71.

Fillon, an amateur rally driver who was born in Le Mans, home of the world-renowned 24-hour race, believes he is “several laps ahead” of his adversary.

Quietly assured

Perhaps because of his softly-spoken and understated style, Fillon was not taken seriously until his late acceleration in the two-month primary campaign.

At the start he was a distant third place in opinion polls, but after a series of assured television performances he surged to take 44 percent of the vote last Sunday. Since then, he has picked up some heavyweight endorsements, including from Sarkozy.

Fillon has a radical economic reform programme, including scrapping the 35-hour week, one of the sacred cows of the French left. He has also pledged to slash an eye-popping 500,000 jobs from the public sector, leading to charges from the more centrist Juppe that he wants to reform “brutally” when a more consensual approach is needed.

“I’m tagged with the label of an (economic) liberal in the same way they would daub crosses on the doors of lepers in the Middle Ages,” Fillon has joked. He argues he is merely “a pragmatist”.

Fillon is also socially conservative, reflecting his life as a father of five children and practising Catholic who has been married to his Welsh wife Penelope for more than 30 years. They live in a 12th century manor house near Le Mans. He voted against gay marriage when it was introduced by Socialist President Francois Hollande and has said he wants to amend the 2013 law.

His views on abortion - he is personally opposed but says he will not change the law or funding for it - have also been in the spotlight. “My conscience is my business,” he said on Thursday during a final televised debate.

Compared with Juppe, Fillon also takes a harder line on questions of identity and Islam which have dominated the Republicans party primary campaign after a string of militant attacks in France.

He penned an anti-Islam book over the summer. “No, France is not a multi-cultural country. France has a history, a language and a culture which have naturally been enriched from outside,” Fillon said on Thursday.

Support from Putin

The self-declared “Gaullist” - a form of nationalism that proposes an independent and strong France - has been in politics for around 40 years. He formed a bond with Russian President Vladimir Putin when both men overlapped as prime ministers from 2008-2012 and their closeness has led to questions about his foreign policy.

Former foreign minister Bernard Kouchner, who worked with Fillon, told AFP this week that the two leaders would sometimes jog together and demonstrated “a friendship, a mutual understanding”.

While Fillon maintains that France must keep its alliance with the United States, he favours closer ties to Moscow and has accused Europe and Washington of provoking Putin.

He is against sanctions imposed on Russia after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and he has resisted pressure to condemn alleged war crimes by Russian forces in Syria.

“The question is: must we continue to provoke the Russians, refusing dialogue with them and pushing them to be more and more violent, aggressive and less and less European?” he said in October.",[],"Share:Guy JACKSON - Francois Fillon, the man tipped to win the French rightwing presidential nomination on Sunday, is a free-market reformer, devout Catholic and motor sport fan who has promised to transform France.

IT is raining anecdotes of harassment and violence against the students across the country. Whether it happens in the premier educational institutes of Lahore, shabby buildings of government-run schools in Southern-Punjab, or a dilapidated madrassah in interior Sindh; sexual harassment and assault in academic institutions is always downplayed.

Educational institutes often believe they can inoculate themselves against legal action and tarnished reputation by denying and ignoring incidents of sexual harassment and assault on their premises. Usually, the investigations in such incidents are delayed; responsibilities are denied; facts are distorted; victims are disparaged and their right to an equal education is devalued.

The recent harrowing anecdotes of sexual harassment in two leading educational institutes of Lahore present scenarios of familiar negligence and institutional apathy. A bunch of female students stormed social media with the videos, pictures, and messages they received from their perpetrators: teachers and staff. Many accused the instructors of inappropriate touching, groping, coercing, and threatening. The harassers warned the students for a reduction in the marks in case of non-compliance. All this happened right under the nose of the administration which kept sitting on the complaints until everything emerged on the social media accounts of the students.

The subsequent vehement public response on social media and the support the victims received from the alumni and public alike speaks volumes about its rampant prevalence in Pakistan. Absence of an effective anti-harassment committee and lack of seriousness led to prolonged misery of the victims who finally summed up their courage to speak-up after several years of agony.

Ignorance, fear of liability, concerns about the public opinion, and bad press is what keeps most schools and varsities turn a blind eye to their utmost obligation: providing a safe and equal opportunity of education to the students.

Schools and varsities claim to take sexual harassment and violence very seriously, yet most of them neither have their anti-harassment policies well defined nor have their harassment inquiry committees working effectively. Preparedness and readiness to tackle real incidents on campus are entirely missing.

When sexual harassment in schools goes un-addressed; the victim is stigmatized. Culprits leaving with impunity creates a culture of violence, aggression, and harassment in society. The notion ‘boys will be boys’ is reinforced. The students learn that sexual misconduct is acceptable, even normal. Impressionable minds of minor students in schools make harassment even more alarming. Several are unable to come out of the traumatic experience they had in their schools for the rest of their lives. Students’ self-esteem stoops low; self-doubt spikes high.

Experts opine that beliefs and attitudes about healthy relationships and sexuality take place early in life and schools must play their part to identify the problem and encounter it by use of words, curriculum, policies, and school culture.

Teachers, school administration, and staff including the gatekeepers, drivers, cleaners, janitors also need training about sexual harassment so they become part of the solution rather part of the problem. Vivid discrimination between bullying in schools and sexual harassment can prepare educators to deal with the issue aptly and educate the students effectively to speak up about their experiences of sexual harassment.

Schools must devise comprehensive strategies to protect themselves from liability of sexual harassment. Hushing away the victims of assault, violence and sexual harassment harms the very students the schools are to protect in the first place. Addressing the issue and striving to solve is the most pragmatic approach to tackle harassment in educational institutions.

Similarly; it is vital for the students that they must also understand and report sexual harassment before it is too late. In the USA, every student has to go through comprehensive online training about sexual harassment and the importance of intervention by the bystanders to avert incidents of harassment and violence on campus. Consequently, every student is well aware of what action or statement can be termed as sexual harassment; how to tackle it, and actions needed to help someone in need. There are several student-run clubs on the campus providing support to the victims and creating awareness about harassment and violence on campus.

In Pakistan, the government helpline to receive complaints about sexual harassment can be accessed. Complainants can also directly go to the ombudsman person who initiates the legal proceedings with confidentiality. Online complaints are is filed with Federal Investigative Agency. Parents, on the other hand, must also educate children from a very young age at home about sexual harassment.

Sexual violence in schools and on campus is a pressing civil rights issue: depriving many of equal and safe access to education. Educational institutes should strive to nip the evil in the bud; rather than denying the problem until it can no longer be hidden and burst out on social media.",['Muhammad Ali Falak'],"Educational institutes often believe they can inoculate themselves against legal action and tarnished reputation by denying and ignoring incidents of sexual harassment and assault on their premises.

Women in our society are not safe at all and the most vulnerable ones tend to be children or from religious minorities. The rape of a 13-year-old Hindu girl is definitive evidence in favour of the argument made before. The cases of sexual violence against women in the holy month of Ramadan testify our moral collapse.

Recent cases of rape show that sexual violence is an on-going problem in Pakistan. The cases that have been reported in the media are just the tip of the iceberg. The issue of sexual violence is deep-rooted than the imagination of anyone. Rape is still an everyday occurrence in Pakistan as the recent case in Tando Muhammad Khan, where two men gang-raped a girl after she was intoxicated, suggests.

According to Sahil’s report for 2018, over ten children were abused every day in Pakistan in 2018. Even a conservative estimate would make four thousand cases of child abuse in 2018. What is mind-boggling is that the government’s attitude in this regard is not even lukewarm. The legislative also does not know how to control the growing abuse of minors. Though the Prime Minister (PM) Imran Khan wants to curb the issue of child abuse by introducing the death penalty for rape of minors, research studies show that the death penalty rarely, if ever, serves the purpose of deterrence.

Moreover, if we look at the pattern of public outrage against rape, we come to know that the uproar is only caused if the victim is a Muslim child, to put it bluntly. The silence of the public over the rape of 13-year-old Hindu girl brutally exposes our double standards. The rape of an adult further exposes the double standards of the Pakistani public. Many, being misogynists, reject an adult rape victim while trying to know about her dress, people she is accompanied by, the places she goes to; others choose to mind their own business.

As if people’s insensitivity over the matter is not enough, the state also ignores the gravity of the problem. For instance, police think of rape survivors as women not having the ‘right demeanour’ as the case of Farishta tells us where the police officials said to her father that she might have eloped with someone. Institutional hurdles like these in investigation and prosecution prove major obstacles in the way of justice being served. It is high time that the government divert its attention towards the growing menace of rape.",[],"The rape of a 13-year-old Hindu girl is definitive evidence in favour of the argument made before.

The New York Times revealed sexual assault accusations on Academy Award winner Harvey Weinstein in a sensational article. However, it has shed light on the much deeper issue of ‘the casting couch’ in Hollywood. This document analyses the origins of this culture and the role of the ideological state apparatus in normalising this behaviour.

More than 50 women have made allegations against Harvey Weinstein and the number continues to grow each day. Among the Hollywood mogul’s accusers are household names who were still looking to establish themselves when the alleged offences took place. Subsequently, he was fired from his company Weinstein Co, however; this doesn’t counter the tradition of abuse that has become a norm within Hollywood.

The first incident of sexual assault by powerful producer dates back to 1921 when Roscoe’ fatty’ Arbuckle raped Virginia Rappe at a party. The injuries were so severe that she died a few days later. Hollywood, however, performed its first cover-up and blamed her injuries on backstreet abortions. Shirley Temple recalled that Arthur Freed, a producer at MGM, exposed himself to her when she was 12 years old. Marilyn Monroe compared Hollywood to an “overcrowded brothel”. The vastly disproportionate power dynamics between men and women weren’t a coincidence though; they were the result of years of weeding out strong women and normalising sexism.

As the film business settled in a Californian orange grove, thousands of young American women made their way to Hollywood hoping to become stars. Cinema had become a vastly lucrative business, but it was star names, not studio brands that sold tickets. In the 1920s, as actress Louise Brooks describes it, when the producers realised that female stars were a threat to their dominance, they waged “a concerted war on the star system”, and abusing the power they had to make or break an actor’s career. Female writers and producers such as Frances Marion and June Mathis, who had held senior positions in the silent-era industry, were squeezed out by the '30s, and soon the business was being run by a group of male executives, many of whom obsessively controlled the films they produced and the women who starred in them. Once a woman became a star her identity was in the hands of these producers, they created and destroyed actresses as they liked. The star was a creation of the executive’s imagination, and his corporate asset, to be discarded as soon as she was tagged “box-office poison”.

The degree of control granted to producers led way to the casting couch culture. The casting couch is used in reference to the supposed practice whereby actresses are awarded parts in films or plays in return for granting sexual favours to the casting director. Foster Hirsch, author of The Boys From Syracuse: The Shuberts’ Theatrical Empire, details how Lee Shubert, the eldest of three brothers who helped establish Broadway’s theatre district in the first two decades of the 20th century, kept “an elegantly furnished boudoir, reserved for leading ladies and promising ingénues, and a shabby, spartanly furnished room with a single couch where he met chorus girls and soubrettes”. one of those dancers, Agnes de Mille, recalled about the Shubert brothers, “If you didn’t sleep with them you didn’t get the part. The Shuberts ran a brothel: Let them sue me.” The practice goes back to the early 1960s when Joan Collins claimed that she lost the lead in Joseph L Mickiewicz’s epic Cleopatra after the studio’s top dog explained that the price for such an illustrious part was sex. The extent of the problem is clearly highlighted when even the biggest female stars like Angelina Jolie are not exempted. It proves that this issue has its roots in a much deeper sociological idea. Icelandic singer Bjork recalls that when she worked with a “Danish director” her “humiliation and role as a lesser sexually harassed being was the norm … it is a universal thing that a director can touch and harass his actresses at will and the institution of film allows it”. Why is it considered normal for powerful men to harass women in the industry? The answer lies in Althusser's theory of the ideological state apparatus.

In Althusser’s view, these ideological apparatuses can properly be described as belonging to the state, even if they appear formally separate from it. He argues that the state actually has two components: a repressive state apparatus, which includes the army, the police, and the courts, and enforces class domination directly, and the ideological state apparatuses (ISA), which maintains complicity and identification with class society. There are two ways to reproduce class structure: controlling the means of production and ideological control. The means of production isolates the proletariat from economic freedom and the ISA legitimises this isolation. The ISA is established through media control. The ownership of media majorly belongs to the elite class that can influence the media content to enforce class structures and submission to the bourgeoisie. They manipulate the media content to reinstate the class hierarchy in the minds of the masses. The ISA puts certain values in focus to instill them in the minds of the masses, so that it is easier to control them. ISA stresses obedience and acceptance of the ruling class as superior. It propagates the idea the isolation from the means of production is justified. Instead they way to success are through obedience of the capitalists and an acceptance of the system. Thereby, delaying class consciousness because the masses start accepts their exploitation as a norm.

The situation in Hollywood works on the same Marxist principles. The bourgeoisie are the producers who exploit the proletariat i.e. actors. In a male dominated industry, the power was held by a few production houses where women had two choices: accept their advances or sacrifice their career. It is an unfair choice to present but then again the balance of power within the industry is unfair. Over time power shifted from production houses to directors, which, not so surprisingly, were also male. This embedded the idea of the 'casting couch' within the members of Hollywood; it became something whose existence cannot be denied. The idea of a casting couch was institutionalised by the ideological state apparatus because it championed values such as obedience and acceptance of the social structure. It advocates submission to those who control the means of production and that they have a right to exploit their workers. In this sense, directors where seen as landowners or factory owners were seen in the past, granting them ample access to exploit these actresses. Since most new actresses are mostly from the middle class looking to have a chance at stardom, they mirror a proletariat hungry for a job. This establishes hierarchy let him abuse women without consequences. The ISA then legitimises these actions by imbedding into people’s minds that this behaviour is simply something to be expected of the elite. That it normal, almost like a rite of passage, for young women to submit to the casting couch, because they must listen to the producers.

Additionally, Marxist feminist theory of double jeopardy applies here as well. Women suffer because of both sexism and capitalism. They are first exploited for labour by the capitalist society, as most of these aspiring actresses belong to the middle class. On top of that, they are exploited by men in the industry because of their gender. The historical context proves that this is something that has been going on since the inception of Hollywood but just wasn't questioned till now. The most plausible reason for this is the ideological state apparatus theory. If Althrusser’s thesis is correct, it is indeed the ideological control perpetuated by the media itself that legitimises sexual advances by powerful men. Women are conditioned into believing this behaviour is okay by two sources: men and the bourgeoisie. In Hollywood, the rich and powerful are inherently men. Ninety six per cent of the directors of last year’s top grossing films were men. For example, Weinstein was allowed to operate like this, and for so long, because the industry has been all-too-comfortable with the very notion of the casting couch. Several prominent actors and directors like Woody Allen, Kevin Spacey, Robert de Niro, Bill Cosby, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon of all have been accused of sexual harassment. Infect, Bill Cosby’s defence on the matter was: ""Even if proven (and it could not be), the age-old ‘casting couch’ is not unique to Mr Cosby, and thus not a ‘signature’ nor a basis for the admissibility of these witnesses’ stories, let alone a conviction.""

This exploitation is especially prominent in Hollywood because of its unique atmosphere. In the media, there is no tangible good produced by actors, rather it’s the actors persona that is to be up for sale. Controversial as it may be, this makes it very easy for men to blur the lines between work and sexual exploitation. Hollywood was once described as ""a town where everyone is selling body and soul for fame and fortune and all – especially women – are considered commodities"" by Peter Keough in 1995. In many instances, directors and producers have demanded women to perform sexual acts in an audition. Helen Mire said she was forced to show off her body for director Michael Winner while seeking a role in one of his projects in 1964. Cara Delavigne came forward, alleging Weinstein had sexually harassed her when she first started work as an actress. He had urged her to kiss another woman, she claimed, before trying to kiss her himself. However, the ISA does not exist in vacuum. The ISA was enhanced by the averment present in Hollywood. Rampant elitist culture also legitimised inappropriate behaviour; new girls were simply expected to put up with whatever well established directors did.

On top of that, proper mechanisms exist to dismiss complaints. Harvey Weinstein reached more than six settlements with the victims. The silencing mechanism is very robust; if you speak out we'll ruin your career. In part, the victims feel trapped. They feel powerless against the abuser who could end their career or smear their name – and makes open threats to do so. The ‘you’ll never work in this town again’. Actress Ashley Judd says that at the time of the incident she thought, ""How do I get out of the room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein?""

This predatory behaviour is propagated by two forces: acceptance and fear. Acceptance of the fact that this is how the world - and the industry- works. That producers and directors can exploit their power over you and you just have to roll with it. Fear works to silence you, because you don’t want your career to end or become the next Patricia Douglas. The ISA is to blame for both of these sentiments. First, it has made us accept exploitation of workers as a norm and second, it has made protest illegitimate. Obedience requires us to remain silent if our rights are inflicted, thus speaking out no longer remains an option. This is proven by the fact that it took three decades and over 50 women to finally speak out against Harvey Weinstein. We need to recognise the stimulus of our behavior if we are to rectify it. We have been secretly enrolled in the working class mentality by our media. The ISA has conditioned us to accept exploitation of ourselves and our peers as a norm, and Hollywood is no exception. The very idea of the ‘casting couch’ is a testament to that.",['Manaal Ahmed'],"However, it has shed light on the much deeper issue of ‘the casting couch’ in Hollywood.

Honour killings are known locally as Karo-Kari, Pakistan has the highest volume of documented an estimated honour killing in Pakistan is performed greatly a rate of increment (1000 out of the 5000 total). Since the death of the victim is viewed as a way of restoring the reputation and honour of the family. It is likely that honour killing has been a practice in Pakistan for thousands of years and it remains a common practice in Pakistan today, unless the general public chooses to condemn the practice.

Honour killings are once again becoming a national controversy in Pakistan, the practice in which a family will murder one of its own members for social transgression such as having premarital sex, is receiving another round of international attention over the killing of a pregnant woman in Lahore. Even though, a 25 year old girl killed by her father for not accepting the relative to marry with.

Honour killings are neither mentioned, nor are they at all exclusive to the Islamic world and as an Islamic state Pakistan, where it is really common, but unfortunately the Islamic leaders in Pakistan are not taking any serious action against that. In 2004, law formally prohibits the practice, still, every year, according to rights groups that track the issue, but numerous hundred Pakistani families kill one another, even the child for bringing shame on the family since the victims are women. To take a case, from 2007, 13 years a Pakistani girl who was raped later on the society members or village elders pressures her family to murder her in an honour killing, but refused, instead asking the police to arrest her repists, fortunately her family’s legal battle for justice for her repists made her case a national symbol of the fight over honour killings.

Actually the reasons that honour killings continue, in Pakistan and elsewhere, are deeply complicated. The people in Pakistan get away with these kinds of executions of women because of weak law and the High Court System must reserve the harshest punishments for women exercising their free will. In 2013, however, Pew released the result of a multi-year, 39- country survey of countries with large or majority Muslim population, then a question was asked to the people who were present there at the time. In other words, whether honour killings are permissible and 45% percent of Pakistani respondents said it was and it is contained on. The local communities in which many or most citizens believe that honour killings are permissible or even just in which many or most people in Pakistan of power believe that, would seem naturally more included to tolerate or even encourage this practice while the popular attitudes are surely far from the only factor that explains the continuation of honour killings. They can play a significant role and the roots of that popular supports are themselves remarkably complex and a subject of life and continued debate among scholars.

Though, Pakistan’s problem with honour killings may receive significant international coverage, mix attitudes towards the practice are not unique to the country. Even the honour killings are never justified as sure that Pakistan is one of the world most populous countries with 180 million people even so a minority of honour killings supporters can do a lot of damage if they have local control but the attention of government is required towards such dangerous issues as the women are victims.

In other words, whether honour killings are permissible and 45% percent of Pakistani respondents said it was and it is contained on.","['islamic', 'honour', 'world', 'women', 'family', 'killing', 'pakistan', 'pakistani', 'practice', 'killings']","{'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/rsss.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/android_app_on_play_logo_small.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/g_plus.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/linkedin_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2019-01-13/test-series-with-south-africa-1547405470-9620.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png?date=2019-02-15', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/twitter.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_publishrr.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/utube.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/uploads/theme/logo-1550475639.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619902433.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/whatsapp_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/facebook.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/app-store.png', 'https://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-01/Lahore/epaper_img_1619826878.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png'}",True,https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg,1,,,,,nation

Florida-The parents of a 2-year-old boy snatched away and drowned by an alligator in Florida have been “overwhelmed with the support and love” that have poured in since the tragedy captured national attention, the family said in a statement.

The alligator grabbed the boy at the water’s edge on Tuesday night while his family, on vacation from Nebraska, relaxed on the shore nearby. The parents tried to save the child but were unable to free him from the alligator’s grip.

“Melissa and I continue to deal with the loss of our beloved boy, Lane, and are overwhelmed with the support and love we have received from family and friends in our community as well as from around the country,” father Matt Graves said in the statement issued by their church in Elkhorn, Nebraska.

“We understand the public’s interest, but as we move forward this weekend, we ask for and appreciate the privacy we need to lay our son to rest. Neither Melissa, myself or anyone from our family will be speaking publicly; we simply cannot at this time,” the statement said.

The Graveses had previously released a statement expressing their devastation and asking for privacy while praising the work of officials who searched for the boy.

Police divers recovered the body of Lane Graves on Wednesday from the man-made lake at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, where he had been snatched the night before.

Disney has since installed signs at water’s edge warning guests of alligators and snakes.

The resort previously had “No Swimming” signs that did not specifically mention alligators.

“Danger! Alligators and snakes in area,” read the new signs, which feature diagrams of the two animals. “Stay away from the water. Do not feed the wildlife.”

The new signs are fixed to wooden posts that hold up rope cordoning off the water.

An autopsy found drowning as the cause of death after the body was found intact underwater.

MADRID - A Palestinian boy who survived a firebombing by Jewish extremists that killed his parents and baby brother arrived Wednesday in Spain where he will meet Real Madrid stars including his idol Cristiano Ronaldo.

Five-year-old Ahmed Dawabsha, who has been recovering from his injuries over the past eight months, was welcomed at Madrid airport by a small group of well-wishers waving Palestinian flags.

A Real Madrid spokesman told AFP the boy, who wore a cap that covered his burns, would be received at the club's stadium on Thursday for a ""private visit"" that would be closed to the media.

Ahmed is expected to meet triple Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo, the Portuguese star of the football club who invited the boy to visit once he was well enough to make the trip.

Ahmed was the sole survivor from his immediate family from a July 2015 attack on their home in the village of Duma in the occupied West Bank.

The attack killed his 18-month-old brother Ali Saad Dawabsha and fatally wounded his parents. Ahmed was hospitalised with severe burns.

""He is doing better, but a lot of time and care is still needed for him to truly recover, his grandfather Hussein Dawabsha said on Tuesday before heading to Spain with Ahmed.

The attack drew renewed attention to Jewish extremism, sparked international condemnation and worsened tensions between Israelis and Palestinians.

Palestinians moved by images of the bandaged boy wearing a Real Madrid jersey campaigned for months on social media to persuade the team to meet Ahmed.

Palestinian Football Association head Jibril Rajoub said Real Madrid were ""restoring hope for a child who lost his entire family"".

Ronaldo in December met a three-year-old Lebanese boy who had lost both parents in a suicide bombing in his home country.

His rival Lionel Messi was similarly moved by the plight of another five-year-old boy.

Afghan boy Murtaza Ahmadi won the Internet's heart when he was pictured wearing a plastic bag as an improvised Messi jersey.

RAWALPINDI - Two British nationals of Pakistani origin along with their father allegedly murdered their step-sister for contracting a marriage of her own free will in Alang Village of Chatala, Jhelum, sources said on Monday.

A murder case (76/18 dated 13/5/2018) was registered against the killers on a complaint of the mother of deceased, identified as Sana, 24, the sources said.

The killers were identified as Ejaz Khizar, Faraz Khizar and their father Chaudhry Khizar Hayyat.

The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) meanwhile, thwarted the fleeing attempt of the two killer brothers, by off-loading them from an Istanbul-bound flight at New Islamabad International Airport (NIIAP) and handed them over to Jehlum police. The sources said the police also held Khizar Hayyat and the husband of deceased Sana, Shahzad Ahmed, into custody in connection with the murder and begun investigation.

According to the sources, a Lahore-based lady Yasmin Farzana had contracted marriage with Chaudhry Khirzar Hayyat after the death of her first husband Javed. The lady had three sons and a daughter Sana Javed. Sana shifted with her mother from Lahore to Alang, Chitala and started living with her stepfather Chaudhry Khizar Hayyat and stepbrothers Ejaz, Faraz and Sultan. However, the sons of Chaudhry Khizar Hayyat were not happy with the marriage of their father with Yasmin.

The sources said Sana also solemnized a court marriage with Shehzad Ahmed which also infuriated her stepfather and brothers. They said Yasmin Farzana along with her son Bilal and daughter Sana were in the market for shopping on May 13, when Ejaz, Faraz, Sultan and others, arrived in two cars and Ejaz and Khizar opened indiscriminate fire on Sana. As a result, she died on the spot while the killers fled the crime scene. The mother of the deceased has also implicated Shahzad in the murder case.

Yasmin Farzana, in her application, a copy of which is available with The Nation, said her stepsons Ejaz, Faraz and Sultan were annoyed over her marriage with their father Khizar. She said her daughter Sana’s love marriage with Shehzad also made them up-happy and they killed Sana during an armed attack. She alleged Shehzad Ahmed, Sana’s husband, was also accompanying the killers at the time of the attack.

Ejaz and Faraz were boarding the Istanbul-bound flight (TK-711) on Monday when they were taken into custody by FIA.

FIA later on handed over the killers to the Jhelum police.

A senior police officer said the police have held five accused including the two UK nationals offloaded from the plane.",['Israr Ahmad'],"The killers were identified as Ejaz Khizar, Faraz Khizar and their father Chaudhry Khizar Hayyat.

Gender-Based Violence is “one of the most serious challenges of our time,” according to an in-depth study on violence against women conducted by the United Nations Secretary General (2006). Effective legislation directed towards crimes against women are crucial in combating practices that perpetuate heinous practices and provisions on such violence are often found in most civil, criminal and administrative codes of most nations. However, they remain highly inadequate in their “scope, remedy and implementation.”

Sexual violence continues to be a heinous crime in Sindh as well. Between the years 2013 to 2019, three hospitals in Karachi alone reported 2,500 rape cases and 593 sodomy cases. In 2019, there were over 545 cases of sexual assault reported at these hospitals, out of which 407 were rape cases and 138 were sodomy cases, estimated at least 2 sexual violence cases per day. As the statistics increase, the conviction rate in Pakistan for such cases remains as low as 3 percent, all while cases remain underreported despite the recent amendments in rape laws.

Along with the various existing deterrents to the successful resolution of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) cases, such as extended trial time and inadequate special protection measures in courts, many officials within the criminal justice system have inadequate knowledge, training and skill for handling sexual and gender-based violence crimes, thereby leading to ineffective investigations of such crimes. The way police and investigation officers respond to GBV cases continues to be a major concern across the globe, including sectors such as different criminal justice agencies, specialist support services and the media. Investigation officers, in any given crime, consider factual objectives, operational tactics and act as a liaison for legal strategy when investigating a crime. This means their primary objective is to collect, confirm and analyse facts with a goal to produce compelling evidence.

Various countries around the world, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, have established specialised police units that seek to improve victim care, the quality of investigation undertaken, and inter-agency working of all actors within the criminal justice system involved. These are specialised divisions or units consisting of investigation officers who specifically investigate crimes that fall under the category of GBV offences. The primary responsibilities undertaken by investigation officers in this Unit include attending to a victim, preserving evidence on the victim i.e., not taking a shower or removing clothes worn during the act of sexual violence, securing and protecting the scene of the incident, apprehending the offender, if possible, assessing and referring the victim to special needs, such as psycho-social counselling, and explaining the investigation process with steps forward to the victim and their family, etc. In the United Kingdom, the “Sexual Offences Investigation Trained Officer” (SOIT) were created whose primary roles was to act as a first responder to allegations of a sexual offence, gather relevant evidence and information from the victim for investigative purposes and secure their confidence and trust in the case.

The steadily rising number of incidents and GBV crimes, and their heinousness being committed across Pakistan reveal that the criminal justice system, particularly the police is showcasing negligence in investigation. A study conducted by the Legal Aid Society, “Gap Analysis on Investigation and Prosecution of Rape and Sodomy Cases in Sindh” reveals that it takes the police approximately 1.6 months to finish investigation and submit a final challan, accounting for 53.3 percent of the total time required to complete a case within the legislative 3-month period. Thus, resulting in compromised evidence and delays in the overall case. Looking at the international examples of success, the police response to such incidences requires not just standard technical knowledge, as is provided in Pakistan, but also an understanding of the gendered aspects of such cases, which must influence how they conduct their investigation and build up evidence. It also requires a nuanced and sensitised approach to the entire case, with a particular emphasis on protecting the victim, whilst recognising the challenge of the social space and order within which they are working.

The establishment of specialised units necessitate the immediate implementation of law to mitigate the issue at hand. The Anti-Trafficking Unit, for example, acts as a body to monitor, prevent and punish those involved in human smuggling. Its success highlights a total of 7037 cases being registered in 2018 and 18 of the most-wanted traffickers/smugglers arrested the same year. Similarly, the similitude of success of a Specialised Cadre of Investigation Officers particularly for GBV cases cannot be denied. It is such measures that affirm better evidence collection and subsequently, more efficient trials and conviction rates.",['Nisa Hafeez'],"Between the years 2013 to 2019, three hospitals in Karachi alone reported 2,500 rape cases and 593 sodomy cases.

Pompeo urged Beijing to immediately end ""these horrific practices"" and asked all nations to join the US in demanding an end to ""these dehumanizing abuses.""

https://nation.com.pk/17-Jan-2014/vatican-grilled-on-child-abuse-by-un-watchdog,2014-01-17 01:27:26+05:00,Vatican grilled on child abuse by UN watchdog,"Share:

GENEVA : The Vatican was Thursday pushed for the first time to provide answers to the UN over its commitment to stamp out child sex abuse by priests.

The landmark question-and-answer session before the UN’s child rights watchdog in Geneva came as Pope Francis said Catholics should feel “shame”, in an apparent reference to the scandals that have rocked the Church. Francis has vowed zero tolerance of abuse, setting up a special committee to investigate sex crimes, enforce prevention and care for victims.

But top officials at the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child questioned the Vatican’s resolve.

“The Holy See has not established any mechanism to investigate those accused of perpetrating sexual abuse, nor to prosecute them,” charged committee member Sara Oviedo.

The Roman Catholic Church has been shaken by a decade-long cascade of scandals involving child abuse by priests and Catholic lay officials, from Ireland to the United States and Australia.

Pressed for details of the Vatican’s new committee, its UN ambassador, Monsignor Silvano Tomasi said the ground rules and membership were still being established. Oviedo also quizzed the Vatican on specifics, demanding to know what it was doing in the case of Archbishop Jozef Wesolowski, a papal envoy from deeply Catholic Poland recalled from the Dominican Republic amid claims of abuse.

Monsignor Charles Scicluna, the Vatican’s former top prosecutor, insisted the Church understood what it had to do.

“The Holy See gets it, that certain things have to be done differently,” he said.

“It’s not words, it has to be commitment on the ground, on the level of the local churches,” he told the panel.

But committee member Hiranthi Wijemanne said perpetrators were too often shielded by their hierarchy.

“Why is there no mandatory reporting to a country’s judicial authorities when crimes occur?” she asked. “Taking actions against perpetrators is part of justice.”

Past cases of abuse were often covered up by priests’ superiors, who typically transferred offenders to new parishes, rather than turn them over to police.

Scicluna insisted there was no conspiracy of silence.

“It is not a policy of the Holy See to encourage cover-ups,” he said. “Our guideline has always been that domestic law of the countries where the churches operate needs to be followed.”

Like other signatories of the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Vatican agrees to submit regular reports on its respect for the rules, and to be scrutinised by an 18-member panel.

Thursday’s session marked the Vatican’s second appearance before the committee. The first was in 1995, before the abuse cases burst into the spotlight.

‘It’s a test of the new pope’

Benedict XVI, pontiff from 2005 to 2013, was the first pope to apologise to abuse victims and call for zero tolerance.

Pope Francis alluded to the abuse revelations in a homily on Thursday, as “the shame of the Church.”

“Do we feel shame? There are so many scandals that I do not want to name them individually but everyone knows about them!” said the pope.

But campaign groups say the pope’s “lofty words” have so far made little difference to victims.

“When is it going to start, what’s going to happen?” Mary Caplan, UN representative of US-based global network SNAP (Survivors’ Network of those Abused by Priests), told AFP.

“Nothing’s changed,” SNAP president Barbara Blaine charged before reporters, citing two benchmarks for judging the Vatican.

“Number one is, are they turning the evidence of sex crimes over to the police? And number two, are they punishing any of the bishops who have enabled and covered up for the sexual predators?

“That would give me hope that children would be protected in our church. But they fail to do either one.”

Tomasi said the Vatican was serious about fighting abuse.

“For the Holy See, the whole problem is a wound that hurts the Church as a community of faith,” he said.

“The Holy See has carefully delineated policies and procedures designed to help eliminate such abuse and to collaborate with respective state authorities to fight against this crime,” he said.

But he argued that the Holy See’s powers were limited given that it was legally responsible only for implementing the UN Convention on children’s rights on the tiny territory of Vatican City — a position long criticised by campaigners.

It was up to nations to crack down, Tomasi insisted.

“Priests are not functionaries of the Vatican. Priests are citizens of their own state and fall under its jurisdiction,” he underlined.

Keith Porteous-Wood, executive director of the British-based National Secular, was scathing.

“The Holy See’s still playing hardball and evading its responsibility under the Convention, for activities which it controls worldwide,” he said.

“It’s just unacceptable.”

“I also think it’s a test of the new pope. He’s getting a wonderful press at the moment, but the reality is that we haven’t seen anything that is any change from the previous regime, apart from the smiling face.”

The Vatican says it continues to receive around 600 claims against abusive priests every year, many dating back to the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.",[],"Share:GENEVA : The Vatican was Thursday pushed for the first time to provide answers to the UN over its commitment to stamp out child sex abuse by priests.

CHICAGO - Two US law enforcement officers have been arrested on charges of murder and attempted murder over the fatal shooting of a six-year-old boy in Louisiana, officials said.

The death of Jeremy Mardis will add to growing criticism over perceived brutality in US police forces after several high-profile incidents over the last year. City marshals Norris Greenhouse, 23, and Derrick Stafford, 32, were arrested on Friday following an incident in Marksville on November 3 in which they opened fire on a vehicle, killing the boy and critically wounding his father, Chris Few, who was driving.

The boy was reportedly hit by five bullets, in the head and the chest. Another two officers that were involved were also placed on administrative leave.

Colonel Mike Edmonson of Louisiana State Police said the boy died while strapped into the front passenger seat. “He didn’t deserve to die like that,” he told reporters at a press conference late on Friday, saying the police badge had been “tarnished.” Citing police body-camera footage of the incident, he described it as “the most disturbing thing I’ve seen.”

He said it was “a complex case.” Investigators told the WBRZ TV station that the four officers had tried to pull the driver over. He then allegedly tried to back down a dead-end street toward the marshals, who responded by opening fire. Few was badly wounded and his son was killed.

The TV station quoted Louisiana State Police as saying no weapons were recovered from the vehicle.

The video clip of a son beating his mother that went viral on social media sites is just an ugly reality of our society that we often try to brush under the carpet. While the police have already registered a first information report (FIR) against the man and his wife, the menace of domestic abuse is not going away with one police report. The video shows us how deep the issue of domestic abuse and violence is. According to the 2019 Women, Peace and Security Index, Pakistan ranks 164th out of 166 when it comes to women’s safety and protection.

Despite the introduction of new laws to protect the women from abuse, especially domestic violence, the situation is not improving. Merely introducing laws that lack proper implementation, and establishing helplines do not mean that the state has fulfilled its responsibilities regarding women protection. Despite the introduction of pro-women laws that criminalise domestic abuse, the barriers in ensuring justice to the victims are too many. The state needs to remove all these obstacles so that the victims of domestic violence can seek a swift remedy. The laws also need further improvements and clarity in their language.

Pakistan seems to have done little to change attitudes and practices. Notably, the most important ones who need a change in their views on the menace of domestic violence are police and courts. They must not see the cases of domestic violence as private family matters; what was basically standard procedure up until very recently. All institutions, especially the police and the legal fraternity, need to receive gender sensitivity training. Essential to our understanding is that domestic abuse is not just about a husband abusing his wife. All women in our families are at threat as long as we do not tackle the problem head-on. Combating violence against women needs to be observed from all angles if the aim is creating gender equality.",[],"The video shows us how deep the issue of domestic abuse and violence is.

The arranged-vs-love-marriage debate goes back a long way. The West has generally done away with arranged matches, but the issue is still unsettled; the institution of arranged marriage is still alive and kicking.

Ardent advocates of both types of marriage exist. Some cynics, however, argue that it doesn’t make much of a difference whether a marriage is arranged or ‘love’. Due to a lack of better options, I have been forced to use the conventional prefixes (‘arranged’ and ‘love’), which leave a lot to be desired really as both arranged and love marriages have something in common: Love inevitably forces the couple to make a lot of arrangements, and love lurks somewhere in arranged-marriages too. It is still an arranged-marriage even if you fall in love with the photograph of your betrothed.

Supporters of arranged-marriages contend that a collective decision is bound to be better than a man deciding on his own. A little reflection tells a different story, however. Probability dictates that a solitary man is more likely to find a decent wife than his mother finding the ‘perfect’ daughter-in-law. Not just that, but other family members will also want a say. In fact, it will be a miracle if all of them end up agreeing on any candidate.

In praise of love-marriages, it is often said that the couple already knows each other by the time they get married. I doubt if they do, really. In a country where there are no live-in relationships (thankfully), and limited contact overall, it’s easy to present the best version of oneself, raising false expectations that are bound to result in disappointment and disillusionment after marriage. In this regard, love-marriages are no different from arranged-marriages, where both families can behave impeccably until the union.

Too often do we see rape and sexual abuse cases in Pakistan go by without the culprits beings punished or brought to account. This happens due to several institutional problems that exist within our legal, criminal justice and political systems- the police are reluctant to register sexual crime cases due to political influence and the victim is coerced into forgiving or retracting her statement because blackmail.

This is what appears to have happened in the rape charge against a member of the provincial assembly (MPA) in a Multan constituency. After facing a number of legal and police hurdles, the victim, who had accused the MPA of raping her and making a video of her to blackmail, has retracted her statement.

There are a number of signs which indicate that the victim’s retraction was due to pressure. The police’s behaviour regarding her case has been very suspect. Previously the police had refused to file an FIR against the MPA, claiming that the girl had never brought the rape charge to the police The police further claimed that the MPA fleeing abroad was not their concern since the victim had never gone to the police. Now the police is denying they ever made those claims, stating the Bahauddin Zakariya police had already lodged a case against the MPA, fearing the girl might have been abducted by the lawmaker. Advocate Iftikhar Gill, the lawyer who had appeared in the court of area magistrate to seek direction for the medical evidence, has also opined that the victim made her statement under duress. It must also be reiterated that the victim has medical evidence of the alleged rape, and the accused has fled the country to avoid facing the charges.

These series of events are a classical pattern of a victim giving in to threats or blackmail by the far-more powerful perpetrator. If there were a case to make an example on how to proceed in case of suspicion with regards to a statement under duress, it is this one.",[],"Share:Too often do we see rape and sexual abuse cases in Pakistan go by without the culprits beings punished or brought to account.

The fireball Chief Minister of Punjab after visiting the grieving parents of a sexually abused and later murdered girl aged six stated that a high ranking Joint Investigation Team (JIT) will be formed to bring the culprits of this horrendous crime to justice. Zainab’s dead body was recovered from a trash heap, almost 2 kilometers away from her home, situated in Kasur district. The news of a six year old, sexually assaulted and later brutally killed, shocked the entire nation.

However, this gruesome incident bears an uncanny similarity to other cases where innocent children have been sexually abused in the past. According to police reports, Zainab’s was the twelfth child sexual abuse case in the past year in Kasur. In 2015, the infamous child pornography scandal in the district was uncovered, where sexually explicit videos of minor children were made and later sold in markets. There was widespread uproar against the incident throughout the country along with the usual condemnations made by people in the highest echelons of power. Strict notice was taken by all state institutions who pledged to eradicate the ignoble disease of child sexual abuse. Additionally, the same master of rhetoric, Mian Shabaz Sharif, constituted a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) similar to the one announced by him on 11th January 2018 to investigate the incident. Efforts were also made by Parliament to introduce legislation in order to curb this wicked offence.

The Criminal Law Amendment Act 2016, for the first time introduced the offence of child sexual abuse and child pornography by amending the Pakistan Penal Code of 1860 and inserting two new sections, namely 292-B and 377-A, dealing with child pornography and sexual abuse respectively. These offences are punishable under the newly introduced amendment with a prison sentence extending to seven years and a fine of five hundred thousand rupees. Previously, there were no laws that dealt with the specific commission of child sexual abuse in the country.

However, despite these attempts, statistics indicate an awfully high number of child sexual abuse cases perpetrated in Pakistan. According to independent surveys conducted by non-governmental organisations, 11 children are sexually abused each day in the country. The vile trend of child sexual abuse is much more pervasive in rural areas than it is in urban centres of the country. According to a report, published by Sahil, an NGO working for child protection, 4,139 children fell victim to sexual abuse in Pakistan with an astounding 76% belonging to rural areas.

The ever-rising number of child sexual abuse cases illustrates that this evil cannot be eliminated by virtue of legislation alone. The growing number of occurrences heralds the social and moral degeneration that has permeated our society. Society as a whole needs to take dramatic steps in order to cure this disease as the government alone is incapable of eradicating child sexual abuse from our nation.

Specialised educational training programs pertaining to child sexual abuse should be initiated in educational institutions throughout the country. These programs should enlighten children about the issue of child sexual abuse and victimisation, including how to react when a sexual offender approaches them. These programs should have components that are not only directed towards students but also instructs teachers, parents and other youth service staff in our country. The responsibility of preventing such incidents from occurring in the future also lies on parents, who should be sensitised through such educational programs so that they can take preventive measures and adopt appropriate safeguards. Parents should educate their children on the differences between a good touch and a sexually offence touch by a stranger or even a family member. Furthermore, religious scholars of our country should also tackle the issue of child sexual abuse by inculcating a sense of responsibility to curb this offence in their followers and by introducing religious teachings against this social evil in their sermons and lectures.

The rampant incidents of child sexual abuse can only be countered by collective responsibility shared by our government, religious scholars, civil society, parents and educational institutions. Tragedies like the murder of Zainab can only be avoided in the future by adopting this approach and culprits can be brought to justice. We as a nation suffer from short-term memory loss and tend to forget horrible occurrences like the murder of Zainab soon after the media stops highlighting the same. However, the legacy of Zainab should be an increased awareness on part of our society to eradicate this social menace once and for all.",['Usama Malik'],"According to police reports, Zainab’s was the twelfth child sexual abuse case in the past year in Kasur.

SHEIKHUPURA/JABRAIN-EDO Health Dr Iftakhar Ahmad directed the sanitary inspectors to ensure the use of iodised salt by monitoring the process of iodisation in the factories and sale at retail outlets and markets.

He instructed them to monitor salt factories on weekly basis. These views were expressed during the annual refresher training of sanitary & food inspectors. The Micronutrient Initiative provided technical and financial support for these events. On the occasion, DO Health Dr Saeed Sajid stressed a need for using the three pronged strategy of motivation, education and legal action to enhance edible salt adequacy. Dr. Sohail Khizar and Dr Nusrat Jabeen informed the participants that IDD free Pakistan means children with higher intelligence quotient, improved mental and physical growth, women with improved fertility, fewer still births and abortions; healthy nation contributing to economic growth of Pakistan.

They explained that numerous complications arise in adults and pregnant women due to the deficiency of Iodine. They said that mixing iodine in edible salt the most cost effective method of eliminating iodine deficiency.

Hafiz Zaheer Ahmad, USI field officer from Micronutrient Initiative, said that 40 salt processors in Sheikhupura district produce more than 1,800 MT of salt every month.

In the last 10 years, the ratio of discrimination against women, rape, and sexual harassment cases are increasing gradually in Pakistan. Rape, violence, and discrimination in Pakistan a notable, and continues to be a tool of suppressing the women in the country. And these cases are reported as per low and in the result females commit suicides and were killed by the family members due to the social patriarchal norms of the society.

As Pakistan is a patriarchal norm based country and these norms are very strong and deeply embedded in the socialization of our children. As women are the victims of discrimination and gender-based violence. And women in Pakistan are socialized as the most sensitive creature of the world who is nothing without the support of a male and males are the only their protector. And these males are the only source of their safety outside their homes. Females are socialised as they are unable to take care of themselves. This makes women the weaker creature and a sense of dependency fully inherited in the females by the females of the family.

In 2018 many workshops related to women self-defense were held in Lahore and Karachi and this is the government’s another step to protect the rights of the women of the country.

I believe that if the patterns of socialization of our children change most of the problems of our society can be solved. If women are empowered with self-defense and would be considered compulsory for the socialization of the girls in schools or would be enrolled in the self-defense institutions. Then the ration of rape, discrimination and violence against women could be decreased and it will help to end the gender discrimination and will also enhance the sense of independence in girls and will empower the girls to participate more efficiently in the economy of the country. And this will increase the productivity of the country and will be Pakistan’s step toward development. The time is right to act on this issue in Pakistan. If we do not address violence against women and girls, sustainable growth will remain elusive.

The 24-year-old model is believed to be one of the jurors who will decide the fate of the disgraced movie mogul, who is currently on trial in Manhattan on five counts pertaining to sexual assault, including two counts of predatory sexual assault, two counts of rape and one count of criminal sex act.

New York Daily News reporter Molly Crane-Newman reported on Twitter on Monday (13.01.20) that Gigi was present in court as one of 120 residents of New York who were summoned for jury duty.

The beauty is believed to have said that although she has met Weinstein before, as well as potential witness and Weinstein accuser Salma Hayek, she can still judge the case impartially and without prejudice.

Molly’s tweets read: ‘’Gigi Hadid was among 120 New Yorkers summoned for jury duty this morning at Harvey Weinstein’s rape and sexual assault trial because mark my words, there will not be a dull moment.

‘’Hadid, seated about 20 feet away from Weinstein, told Judge Burke that she’d met the defendant before but still felt she could judge the case impartially. She also said that she’d met potential witness Salma Hayek.

‘’[She said] ‘’I think I’m still able to keep an open mind on the facts.’’ (sic)’’

It is okay to listen to the news but it’s upsetting to listen to the same news on a daily basis that makes you feel scared and worried. I don’t know why but people don’t understand this fact that when women and girls read and hear about rape, gang rape, sexual harassment, honour killing and continuous victim-blaming, it builds up a kind of trauma in our mind that scares us and we start visualizing things like those women could be us or our loved ones. I know I’m not alone in this; every girl around me may have the same thoughts.

Many people talk about their journeys and about the times that they have gone alone on road trips, travelled all alone and slept in their cars, parks hotels and hostels. What about women? We are not allowed to travel at night. We will be asked: why did she travel without her man, why is she taking her kids with her and many more. We continuously blame the victims, even those who are being raped, murdered and burnt so badly and found somewhere in unrecognizable condition.

Rape culture is actually a social environment that is allowing sexual violence to be normalised and justified and blaming the victims. Rape is not the fault of survivors or victims.

Instead of teaching women to change their appearance and behaviours in order to not get raped, teach men not to rape and respect women. For this we need to reform the societal behaviour over this disease that can not be cured automatically.

Besides society, our system and government have an important role to play to deal with such horrific crimes that we often hear on daily basis. There should be public hanging of rapists so that sick people think twice before shaming humanity.

Please don’t blame the victims, blame and hang the culprits and rapists who targeted those small flowers and our heavens.

May Allah guide us on right path.

Please don’t blame the victims, blame and hang the culprits and rapists who targeted those small flowers and our heavens.","['raped', 'sexual', 'women', 'listen', 'dont', 'blame', 'rapists', 'culture', 'trauma', 'travel', 'rape', 'victims']","{'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/rsss.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/android_app_on_play_logo_small.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/g_plus.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/linkedin_share.png', 'https://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619912693.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png?date=2019-02-15', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/twitter.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_publishrr.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/utube.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2020-10-16/cartoon-1602789738-7854.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/uploads/theme/logo-1550475639.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619902433.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/whatsapp_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/facebook.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/app-store.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png'}",True,https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg,1,,,,,nation

FAISALABAD/LAYYAH - A minor girl was allegedly killed after rape in the area of Millat Town police station in Faisalabad, while Regional Police Officer (RPO) Riffat Mukhtar Raja took notice of the incident and directed the City Police Officer (CPO) Faisalabad to submit its report at the earliest.

A police spokesman said on Sunday that 4-year-old girl Meerab, daughter of a brick-kiln worker Faqeer Hussain, went missing while playing outside her house in Chak No 201-RB Chandian Talawan after Asar prayers. Her parents searched for her and found her body lying in a blood pool outside the locality late in the night.

They reported the matter to the police who took the body into custody and dispatched it to mortuary for postmortem. According to initial investigation, the girl was raped after abduction and then the accused killed her due to fear of arrest, the spokesman said.

In another incident, a newly-wed woman was killed by her in-laws for dowry in Layyah’s Chowk Azam, the police said on Sunday. According to the investigating officer, the woman married the suspect, identified as Azam, a month back. “Azam’s family demanded a car in dowry but we refused,” her brother said.

On Saturday, the culprit strangled my sister to death, he added. The body had been moved to a hospital for a post-mortem examination. An FIR had been registered. The suspect, on the other hand, managed to escape from the crime scene. The police are conducting raids to arrest the perpetrators as soon as possible.

The headlines of local newspapers, scream that it is ‘the largest –ever child abuse scandal in Pakistan’s history’. The victims are about 300 children, most of them being under 14 years old, forced to have sex in front of the cameras of mobile phones. The perpetrators are a gang of 25 individuals, mostly young men and teenagers led by two men in their 40s. It is said that this gang arranged the abuse, perpetrated it in many cases, and then used the videotapes of the assaults to blackmail the children and their families to hand over millions of rupees.

These are things that are naively thought to not exist in Pakistan. Crimes like these only happen on Western ‘God-forsaken’ soil. With silence emulating from the local police and the MPA’s of that area, then the question is that why are we not more distraught by this news?

The police found 400 video tapes of these children, both girls and boys being sexually abused, ones that had thousands of copies being made of them, and were believed to have been sold for rupees fifty each, in Hussain Khanwala village, Kasur district. This stingy two-digit amount is the price that is being paid for these children, ones that had no other option other than to obey. Why was there nobody to stop these vile men conducting such a business? Where was the police? Where was the conscience of the men of the village? Why is it that these children, some that have been victims since almost ten years, were not able to cry out even once against this twisted fate? Was their plight taken so lightly? Many of the parents have identified their children as victims in the films. Some of the clips, show that the victims were abused for more than an hour. The ‘producers’ without any fear, without any repercussions, shot videos at different locations, in open fields, washrooms, bedrooms, and at deserted houses.

I cannot even start to fathom, how one should react if not with remorse and flashes of rage. These children had to replace their childhood, one that was supposed to be a memory of holding hands while walking towards school, playing cricket and listening to their parents telling them stories of a brighter future. Instead, they were forced to make sure their families were not hurt, or their ‘honor’ was somehow given back to them, if these criminals remained quiet.

In Pakistan, children grow up fast.

The local police and government of the area were prancing around with these predators. What should come as a shock, but doesn’t, is the involvement of the local MPA of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), playing a crucial role in the withdrawal of the allegations against the main suspect in the case, after a 5 million bribe was paid. The plot thickens, but so does the air around this fine chap, who denies such outrageous allegations, but claims that he is sympathetic to the protestors demanding justice, and has been personally following the case for about a month. Does he think that the public is that oblivious, or was it that he never thought he would actually have to face the media regarding this? I believe the latter was what he was going for; where from the accounts, those that have been brought out by the families of the victims, he along with the police, should also be seen as the main culprits.

One woman, being interviewed by a TV channel was asked why she never involved the police or the area MPA regarding the abuse that was being carried out against her son. The simple but heartbreaking response was that ‘Sab ko ghar dikhaya tha’ (We showed everyone the house). Despite her having alerted the police, the MPA, even showing them where the perpetrators lived; they simply looked the other way.

In Pakistan, child abuse is taken lightly.

A recent report on the subject of child abuse by a Supreme Court lawyer will have parents reconsidering the thought of raising their children on Pakistani soil. In 2014, around 767 children across Pakistan were raped and murdered, 368 children committed suicide, 201 were killed as part of honor killings, 189 became victims of human trafficking, 456 were kidnapped and 269 went missing. With these statistics being the small portion that has been actually recorded, it is safe to say that all provinces have failed to protect children. We call them the most vulnerable citizens of the country, but do nothing to make sure that they are never taken advantage of.

The policy regarding child protection is almost non-existent; where because of this culture of shame and silence by the victims we can never look forward. Concrete legislation is required, one that efficiently works to protect children from these exploitations. But we can never call ourselves advocates of children, if we do not break the taboo surrounding any talk regarding abuse. If a girl is abused, she will bring disgrace to her whole family, and if a boy is abused, his masculinity will be questioned, if he even dares to speak about it. We have given these criminals too much power. For, how long should we wait to change our culture and change our politics? Until these perpetrators are living in your neighborhood, observing your child when he or she goes to school in the morning?

Domestic violence and abuse can happen to anyone, it does not discriminate. It is used for one purpose: to gain and maintain total control over an individual. An abuser doesn’t play fair. An abuser uses fear, guilt, shame, and intimidation to wear you down and keep you under their thumb. It occurs within all age ranges, ethnic backgrounds, and economic levels. And while women are more often victimised, men also experience abuse, especially verbal and emotional abuse. The bottom line is that abusive behaviour is never acceptable, whether from a man, woman, teenager, or an adult. You deserve to feel valued, respected, and safe.

Domestic abuse often escalates from threats and verbal assault to violence. And while physical injury may pose the most obvious danger, the emotional and psychological consequences of domestic abuse are also severe. Emotionally abusive relationships can destroy your self-worth, lead to anxiety and depression, and make you feel helpless and alone. No one should have to endure this kind of pain and your first step to breaking free is recognising that your relationship is abusive.

Many men and women suffer from emotional abuse, which is no less destructive. Unfortunately, emotional abuse is often minimised or overlooked even by the person experiencing it. If you suspect that someone you know is being abused, speak up! If you’re hesitating, and telling yourself that it’s none of your business, or that the person might not want to talk about it, you might be wrong. Keep in mind that expressing your concern will let the person know that you care and may even save their life.

LAHORE - A nine-year-old boy died and another sustained critical wounds when they were hit by bullets fired by bodyguards of PML-N supporters at a corner meeting in Kot Lakhpat late Tuesday, police said.

The deadly gunfire comes one week after the Punjab Police were ordered to enforce the ban on aerial firing, fireworks, and even display of weapons during election rallies under the ECP’s code of conduct.

It was also learnt that some police officials were present at the corner meeting but they did not bother to stop aerial firing.

SP Model Town (Police Division) told reporters that an unidentified bodyguard of Aslam Bhatti, said to be a supporter of PML-N candidates Malik Pervaiz (NA-133) and Khawaja Saad Rafique (PP-168), started aerial firing during the corner meeting.

As a result, nine-year-old Mazhar Manzoor died on the spot. A 12-year-old boy Fahad Haneef sustained bullet wounds and was rushed to Lahore General Hospital where he was stated to be in serious condition. The body was shifted to the morgue for autopsy. The shooter managed escape.

The police official also claimed that they were conducting raids to arrest the gunman.

The two boys were standing among crowds in the densely populated locality when bodyguards of Aslam Bhatti fired gunshots into the air.

The shooting triggered panic in the residential colony as many people rushed to safety.

A large number of people also took to streets to protest against the deadly shooting. According to police sources, the PML-N supporters earlier blamed unidentified PTI workers for the gunfire during the corner meeting.

A police investigator later claimed the gunman, not identified yet, was arrested by police immediately after the fatal shooting.

One of the perks of living in 21st century is believing in virtual reality. One may easily think that gender discrimination is now merely a myth. The girl next door is doing a job, getting higher education, she even goes to market alone instead of being locked down within the four walls of the house. It’s impossible that someone is going to force her into something against her will. But the picture is far bleak. The same girl is soon forcefully married to keep the respect of family.

Obviously education has given her a voice and confidence but soon everyone reproaches education as the main culprit for the girl to express her opinion. In a battle between girl’s happiness and family’s respect, latter wins most of the time. The tactics for achieving this success differs in variant segments of our society from emotional trauma, physical violence to simply selling her off. This is just one form of domestic violence that 90 percent of women in Pakistan experience at the hands of families or husbands. Physical, psychological and sexual abuse from intimate partners are much common then it appears to be. The intensity of the situation can be well acquainted by a survey done by Thomson Reuters Foundation which ranked Pakistan as the third dangerous country for women next to Afghanistan and Congo.

Sadly, most of the times domestic violence goes unnoticed. Statistics show that only 0.4 percent women take their cases to court. One of the major reasons is the societal brought up which inculcates that it’s okay to be abused by males of the family. The common norm that it the duty of a female to keep quiet in front of any kind of abuse by her family and especially her husband is a quotidian notion. A recent survey carried out by Gallup Pakistan, shows that 65 percent Pakistanis believe domestic violence is a family’s personal problem; not to be interfered by social organisations and media. Other reasons for this patriarchal notion includes lack of awareness regarding basic human and legal rights, financial dependence on male members of the family, psychological pressure due to marriages within extended family and fear of societal reactions.

There are proper women shelters and government organisations for social welfare and women protection in all the provinces. In addition, there are a number of non-governmental bodies working for women against domestic violence. However, the number of people well informed about them is a drop in the bucket. The Punjab Protection of Women against Violence Act (PPWAVA) provided unprecedented protection to women against domestic violence. It encompasses domestic, psychological, emotional, economic as well as cyber abuse. The irony of our society is that most of the time women protection laws are highly criticised and made controversial by male segment of clerics and others as un-Islamic and so forth. This clarifies that the problem is very deep rooted. Furthermore, the lack of awareness about the protection laws particularly among females remains a major issue.

Merely setting up institutions and passing laws won’t help the situation unless the issue is taken seriously and efforts are made to dig out the root causes which exacerbate this evil. The first and the foremost step could be a nationwide awareness campaign discouraging domestic violence of all kinds. Of course, media can play a vital role in spreading the awareness about women protection and their legal rights to the most remote corners of the country. Proper enforcement of women protection laws will uplift the confidence among women. Moreover, empowering women in all the fields of life will further minimise the alarming statistics of domestic violence.

It’s easy said than done. Why women don’t get out of abusive marriages or speak up for their rights is a general question asked by many. The emotional and psychological trauma faced by women shatters their self confidence in most of the cases. They think of this abuse as their fate. The most feasible solution they could think of is to stay quiet usually for most of their lives. They secretly hope for things to get better or wait for a miracle to happen. But miracles seldom happen, making them immune to the domestic violence which they consider as part of their daily life. This is the silent evil flourishing in most of the households. It is the duty of all the individuals of our society to help those who are forcefully shunned of their basic human and legal rights. But charity begins at home. If only we realise that women are as human as males, they have basic human and legal rights and that they can also have freedom of expression which will certainly halt this evil forever. If the cost of maintaining family’s respect or saving marriage is destruction of a woman physically or psychologically then the cost is simply too high.",['Sania Akram Khan'],"This is just one form of domestic violence that 90 percent of women in Pakistan experience at the hands of families or husbands.

But miracles seldom happen, making them immune to the domestic violence which they consider as part of their daily life.","['legal', 'common', 'protection', 'psychological', 'women', 'laws', 'think', 'rights', 'human', 'family', 'domestic', 'violence']","{'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/rsss.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/android_app_on_play_logo_small.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/g_plus.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/linkedin_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/digital_images/medium/2017-09-04/domestic-violence-is-more-common-then-we-all-think-1504537487-2540.jpg', 'https://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619912693.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png?date=2019-02-15', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/twitter.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_publishrr.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/digital_images/large/2017-09-04/domestic-violence-is-more-common-then-we-all-think-1504537487-2540.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/utube.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/uploads/theme/logo-1550475639.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619902433.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/whatsapp_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/facebook.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/app-store.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2021-05-02/so-what-disaster-are-we-writing-about-today-stories-today-pandemic-pverty-scandal-1619896356-6502.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png'}",True,https://nation.com.pk/digital_images/large/2017-09-04/domestic-violence-is-more-common-then-we-all-think-1504537487-2540.jpg,1,,,,,nation

https://nation.com.pk/19-Sep-2018/kavanaugh-accuser-demands-fbi-probe-before-testifying,2018-09-19 08:29:07+05:00,Kavanaugh accuser demands FBI probe before testifying,"Share:

President Donald Trump doubled down Tuesday on backing his Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh, as his accuser demanded an FBI probe into her allegations of sexual assault before testifying.

""A full investigation by law enforcement officials will ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions,"" lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford said in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee.

The Republican-dominated panel had invited both Kavanaugh, 53, and Ford, 51, to testify publicly about her claims he pinned her down while he was drunk when they were teenagers.

Although Ford's letter does not indicate whether she would attend the hearing without a probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, it said that she has faced ""vicious harassment and even death threats"" since going public with her allegations on Sunday.

""As a result of these kind of threats, her family was forced to relocate out of their home. Her email has been hacked, and she has been impersonated online,"" it added.

Democrats were quick to back her call for a delay.

""I agree with her 100 percent that the rushed process to hold a hearing on Monday has been unfair and is reminiscent of the treatment of Anita Hill,"" said Senator Dianne Feinstein.

She was referring to the woman who testified in 1991 against Justice Clarence Thomas when he was a nominee over workplace sexual harassment claims. Thomas ultimately won confirmation after Republicans ruthlessly smeared Hill's character.

""A proper investigation must be completed, witnesses interviewed, evidence reviewed and all sides spoken to. Only then should the chairman set a hearing date,"" said Feinstein.

Senator Chuck Schumer said Ford ""deserves to be treated with respect and fairness by the Senate.""

Trump, who has shrugged off allegations about his own sexual improprieties, told a White House press conference that Kavanaugh has an ""impeccable history in every way"" and ""has gone beautifully up the ladder.""

Although he repeated his full support for the planned hearings over the claims, the president also rejected calls for an FBI probe and blamed the uproar on Democratic shenanigans to cast doubt over his pick to replace retired justice Anthony Kennedy.

""I don't think the FBI should be involved because they don't want to be involved,"" Trump told reporters.

""I feel so badly for him. This is not a man who deserves this,"" the president said, calling Democratic opponents who raised the issue at the last minute ""lousy politicians"" but ""very good at obstructing.""

Trump's vote of confidence in Kavanaugh reinforces what is rapidly becoming the latest battlefront in the deeply polarized country ahead of November midterm congressional elections.

Last minute bombshell

Kavanaugh, whose confirmation would tilt the Supreme Court to the right for years to come, had appeared set to sail through Senate confirmation for the vacancy on the nation's top court until Ford, a California professor, went public.

A man Ford placed at the site of the assault as a witness, Mark Judge, categorically refused to testify.

""I have no memory of this alleged incident... More to the point, I never saw Brett act in the manner Dr Ford describes,"" Judge said in a letter to the committee sent by his lawyers.

""I have no more information to offer the committee and I do not wish to speak publicly regarding the incidents described in Dr Ford's letter.""

Pressure is also building from supporters of the year-old #MeToo movement, which has brought down a string of powerful male figures after women went public with accusations of sexual harassment and assault.

""Anybody who comes forward at this point to be prepared to testify in the US Senate against someone who's being nominated to one of the most powerful positions in the US government, that takes an extraordinary amount of courage,"" said Democrat Kamala Harris, a member of the panel weighing Kavanaugh's nomination.

""The American public deserves to know the character of someone who will serve for his entire life on the highest court in our country.""

Upcoming polls

The charge against Kavanaugh has left Trump and his Republicans in the precarious position of having to reject Ford's accusation without alienating women voters ahead of the midterm polls in which the Republicans could lose control of Congress.

Republicans are treading carefully, eager to avoid a repeat of the Thomas-Hill debacle. Their strategy appears to be centered on keeping the hearing to a limited ""he said-she said"" standoff that might embarrass, but not sink the nominee.

Republican supporters have also mustered letters from dozens of women declaring support for Kavanaugh throughout his career.

BUREWALA-A 12-year-old boy, who was missing since two days, was found brutally tortured to death after being sexually abused. Dead body of the boy was found from a tube-well at Chak 515/EB near PI-Link Canal here Saturday morning.

Ali Manzoor,12, son of Manzoor Ahmad, a Class 5th student and resident of Azimabad, Burewala, had gone missing since Thursday afternoon. He left his house for a nearby tuition centre and never returned. His parents and relatives searched him but did not find about his whereabouts.

Later, the police arrested a youth Ali Jaan,16, with help of CCTV footage showing the youth, a student of 9th class, was taking the victim on his motorcycle. Initially the suspect denied the allegations but last night when police arrested his mother, he confessed to his crime. He told the investigators that he took the boy to a place where he assaulted him sexually and later tortured him to death.

LAHORE - A very refined producer, Sadia Jabbar’s Mere Bewafa is making waves due to its gripping plot and beautiful depiction by its cast featuring Shagufta Ejaz, Zhalay Sarhadi, Agha Ali and Sarah Khan.

The story spins around Azra (Sarah Khan) who is crazy in love with her husband, Shahmeer (Agha Ali) and is an obedient wife. On the other hand, Shahmeer betrays her and marries her close friend Mona (Zhalay Sarhadi).

Azra gets shattered with the news and ask her mother-in-law (Shgufta Ejaz) to never let Mona enter her home. But Azra’s sister in laws being the bad girls provoke Mona to live with them as she has the equal right to reside there as she is expecting a child. Innocent Azra gets devastated to see Mona and Shahmeer in her home. Mona takes an edge of that and stole her bedroom too. Azra is also pregnant but Shahmeer doesn’t pay heed to that and take her for granted like forever.

On the other hand Shahnawaz (Shahmeer’s elder brother) leaves the house because of ill treatment to Muskaan (Shahnawaz’s wife) by the family.

Shahnawaz’s family leaves no stone unturned to make her life miserable; and that is why she moves back to her own home. In episode 13, Shahnawaz’s family reaches his office to take him back home and gets shocked by the news that he’s getting transferred by the company and emotionally blackmail him. But he doesn’t agree to move in again and offers financial help to his mother that she denies taking.

Azra acts totally insane when Mona tries to talk to her and terrifies her by her behavior. Later Muskaan comes to meet Azra and suggests her to fight for her self-esteem and rights and stop crying for Shahmeer. Azra is unable to handle Shahmeer’s unfaithfulness but finally decides to take a stand for her child. She leaves everyone dumbfounded by speaking for her rights and equal share in the house.

https://nation.com.pk/12-Feb-2021/gender-based-violence-courts-in-pakistan,2021-02-12 00:46:51+05:00,Gender-based violence courts in Pakistan,"Share:

A 3 percent conviction rate in crimes related to Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) is evidence that violence against women and girls continues to run rampant in Pakistan despite consistent and extensive law reform on various types of crimes against women, children and other vulnerable groups. Among the many issues that plague the country, gender disparity in all sections of society (as evidenced by World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Parity Index where Pakistan ranks 151 out of 153 country) is a result of the violence, discrimination and injustice to which women and girls are subjected daily.

Progressive legislation and the commitment to establish better mechanisms has improved the criminal justice system’s response to Gender-Based Violence (GBV) to an extent. A reformist spirit espoused by the judiciary, parliament and civil society organisations resulted in laws such as the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Offences Relating to Rape) Act, 2016 and the Sindh Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection Act), 2013 which have paved the way for a stronger commitment to fight GBV and enhance legal protections afforded to victims of such crimes. However, the challenge still lies in implementation of these laws due to lack of effective mechanisms, infrastructure and institutional non-commitment to implement the letter and spirit of such legislation. Thus, the conviction rates especially in cases of rape (including male rape), child abuse and domestic violence have not increased, rather attrition levels have augmented.

A Sindh-focused study conducted by the Legal Aid Society on Gaps in Investigation and Prosecution of Rape and Sodomy cases provides a snapshot of the timelines involved in such cases in Sindh after a 3-month time limit for rape trials was prescribed by the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Offences Relating to Rape) Act 2016. It is important to note that the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 also provides 14 days for investigation, with special permission to be granted for investigation taking longer. The Gap Analysis shows that on average, it takes about 14 months for rape and sodomy cases to be decided, calculated from the date of FIR to date of final order. Though the investigation phase takes up 1.5 months of total time, the report observes that the trial phase takes up more than 9 months which is three times the stipulated duration as per the 2016 law. A qualitative assessment of the cases also revealed how gender bias and societal norms influence the decisions taken by the criminal justice system which further add to the problems faced by litigants. Lack of gender-neutral language in judgment writing, lack of understanding of medical evidence and great reliance on rape myths creates an environment which is opposed to a victim-centric approach to prosecuting GBV. The report further states that attrition levels remain high due to victims and witnesses resiling and entering into out-of-court compromises. In about 52 percent cases studied, victims and prosecution witnesses resiled which led to acquittals.

It is also observed that victim/witness resiling is also a consequence of the traumatising experiences they go through while struggling to obtain justice. Another study conducted by the Legal Aid Society studies Court User Satisfaction to gauge the experience of victims of GBV and to gain an understanding of the factors that contribute to low confidence in the criminal justice system’s ability to deliver expeditious justice. Evidence from the survey conducted in Karachi and Hyderabad GBV Courts shows that absence of special protection measures contribute to low perceptions of safety by women as compared to men. Victims of GBV also reflected that long drawn legal battles negatively impacted their experience with the court and in many situations coerce them to enter into compromises with the accused.

Evidencing the data from research conducted on GBV cases and courts shows how litigants suffer in their struggle to obtain justice. Victims of rape and sodomy particularly go through re-traumatisation due to delays in justice, lack of protection measures and insensitive questioning and treatment during trial. In such a hostile environment, owing to long case proceedings and due to external pressures and intimidation victims/complainants of GBV are forced to compromise. This significantly hampers any successes gained at the legislative front.

Recognising the current gaps in the judicial system, in November 2019 the National Judicial Policy Making Committee (NJPMC) directed all provincial High Courts to establish special Gender Based Violence Courts in an effort to provide speedy justice to victims of SGBV on a priority basis and in a gender-sensitive manner. Section 3 of the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Ordinance, 2020 has also promulgated the establishment of Special Courts for GBV, signalling towards the prioritisation SGBV crimes require and has provided a legal cover to these existing courts.

The operationalisation of special procedures such as GBV courts are aimed at alleviating the challenges and problems victims face in an effort to obtain justice. These challenges represent not only legal problems, but also the social, structural and systemic issues that women and girls confront daily. A victim of rape or child abuse while facing societal pressures to compromise also has to go through severe episodes of re-traumatisation and victimisation during trial. Constant intimidation by the accused, in addition to inappropriate questioning by defence counsel at trial and the social stigma and shame attached to such a horrific crime coerces victims/survivors into compromising or resiling.

GBV courts essentially work towards eliminating the challenges faced by such victims and survivors. These courts operate with the objective to reduce trial time; to create a safe space and environment for victims and survivors through implementation of special protection measures; improving the experience of victims/survivors with the CJS through adoption of victim-centric approach and elimination of insensitive treatment and adoption of a coordinated and integrated approach among various CJS actors to work towards increasing conviction rates to deter GBV crimes. The promulgation of establishing GBV courts is inspired by their success in other jurisdictions and reinforced by the success of the GBV court established in Lahore. In many countries such as South Africa, UK, New Zealand and India, the success of special courts for GBV has been manifold. In addition to easing access to justice for victims and survivors, these courts have also enhanced deterrence to the incidence of such crimes by increasing conviction rates (65 percent of all tried cases in South Africa and 78 percent in Spain). Furthermore, these courts have also considerably built public confidence in state institutions’ ability to deliver justice through strict enforcement of special protection measures.

The GBV Courts are now operational across Pakistan. Lahore and Islamabad High Courts have created guidelines for the operation of these courts and for how judges should proceed in such cases. However, these have not yet been notified in Sindh, leaving a gap in the effective functioning of these courts, resulting in the absence of an operational framework under which they can operate. The User Satisfaction Survey and Assessment of GBV Courts conducted by LAS provide ample evidence that currently the 27 GBV Courts in Sindh have not implemented special protection measures and special procedures which reflect these courts’ special GBV charge. For the GBV Courts to have the kind of success seen in international jurisdictions, the State, the Supreme Court and High Courts must provide adequate technical and human resources to ensure their full operationalisation; this needs to be done by implementing special protection measures such as victim waiting rooms and video-link testimony facilities to name a few. All GBV Courts must be equipped with these facilities, as opposed to the ad hoc allocation to only a few courtrooms instead of all.

With SGBV related crimes rising exponentially across the country, it has become all the more imperative to fully operationalise special protection mechanisms and infrastructure provided by the Gender Based Violence Courts. Integrated approaches are also required to reduce trial times as laid down in the 2016 Rape Act. Ensuring that GBV courts function under a strong legal and operational framework will serve this purpose. Indeed, the full operationalisation of all GBV courts across the country can usher in a new era of addressing gender-based violence with greater rigor and strict enforcement of the law to secure greater conviction rates and increase deterrence towards sexual and gender-based violence crimes.

GAZA CITY - A three-year-old Palestinian girl was killed in an Israeli raid on the Gaza Strip after the fatal shooting Tuesday of an Israeli near the Gaza border, in the latest uptick in Israeli-Palestinian violence.

Cross-border exchanges between Israel and Gaza have increased in recent days, and Israel said Tuesday it held Islamist movement Hamas responsible, as rulers of the Palestinian enclave, for any fire directed from there at the Jewish state.

Palestinian medics named the dead girl as Hala Abu Sabikha from a refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip.

They said at least six other people had been wounded in the series of tank and air strikes throughout Gaza, including on militant positions.

The Israeli army said its aircraft, tanks and infantry “targeted terror sites in the Gaza Strip.”

“The sites included a weapon-manufacturing facility and a terror infrastructure in the southern Gaza Strip, a terror site and another terror infrastructure in the central Gaza Strip and a concealed rocket launcher in the northern Gaza Strip.” The army said the attacks were in retaliation for the shooting of an Israeli man who was engaged in maintenance work on the Israel-Gaza border fence in the northern Gaza Strip.

A police spokeswoman identified him as Saleh Abu Latif, 22, a Bedouin from the southern town of Rahat.

The army said Abu Latif was the “first Israeli civilian killed in the vicinity of the Gaza Strip” since a major eight-day outbreak of fighting in and around Gaza in November 2012.

Just ahead of the air strikes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Israel would respond “forcefully” to the attack. On Monday, the army said troops had fired at an individual “trying to place a bomb” near the fence in northern Gaza.

Earlier the same day, police reported a rocket fired from the Hamas-ruled coastal enclave had hit southern Israel without causing any casualties or damage.

A Palestinian was shot and wounded by Israeli soldiers on Friday in southern Gaza, a day after another Palestinian was killed and four wounded along the heavily fortified fence.

Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon stressed on Tuesday that “in Gaza, Hamas is ruler, and we hold it responsible for the shooting today from the Strip and the rocket launches in the past two days at Israel.” “I advise Hamas to not test our patience,” he said in a statement. “If there won’t be quiet in Israel, there won’t be quiet in Gaza either.”

A statement from Hamas, which does not recognise Israeli, said “the occupier and its raids will not deter or stop the resistance.”",[],"Share:GAZA CITY - A three-year-old Palestinian girl was killed in an Israeli raid on the Gaza Strip after the fatal shooting Tuesday of an Israeli near the Gaza border, in the latest uptick in Israeli-Palestinian violence.

https://nation.com.pk/02-Oct-2014/abortion-a-social-taboo,2014-10-01 23:11:12+05:00,Abortion: a social taboo,"Share:

Life as we know it, is the most sacred trust God has bestowed to humanity. And the disrespect of life is a most heinous crime. However, there are many dilemmas one faces in terms of social dictums, and abortion is an important one. Terminating a life within a woman’s body seems a gory predicament, and it has turned into one of the biggest morality debates the world has seen. The moral judgment has made its way into state legislatures and the practice has been banned in many parts of the world.

We must understand what abortion is and why women go for it in Pakistan despite knowing it is abhorred by society. There are two types of abortions that take place in Pakistan: safe and unsafe. The former are conducted in a clinical environment with all medical protocols in place, while the latter is done in non-clinical facilitations by untrained midwives, back alley doctors and quacks—putting the health of women in danger and leading to horrific deaths. A nationwide survey conducted by the Population Council in 2002 estimated that at least one pregnancy in five is terminated. Maternal deaths stand at 20.3% of women belonging to reproductive age, and deaths due to unsafe abortions stand at 5.6% approximately. These are huge numbers.

Abortion however, is not to be defined as the use of contraceptives, which is how most clergy interpret it in their preachings, thereby discouraging couples from using it. The trend has caused serious repercussions on family planning and population control initiatives, but there are very nominal efforts undertaken by the government to confront clerical teachings. Furthermore, since devolution, there are no concrete steps taken at the provincial level for birth control initiatives.

In Pakistan, since 1997, abortion has been allowed in the first 120 days since conception in cases of rape, physical disability or threat to a woman’s life, but this law is widely unknown to most practitioners which leaves women in peril when seeking abortions. In 1997, the Commission of Enquiry for Women presented three recommendations. These were: 1) Allocations to health and population sectors be increased by 6% of GDP; 2) Regulations be amended to ensure women’s right to tubal ligation without husband’s permission; and 3) Women’s right to obtain an abortion by her own choice within 120 days of pregnancy be unambiguously declared her absolute right. These recommendations presented by Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid were never legislated for clarity in the law.

Social factors play a pivotal role in cases of abortions. Sometimes, abortion is carried out without the will of women, forcing her to abort if the child she’s carrying is female. Sometimes, she is forced to keep the child against her will. Whether women should be in control of their bodies remains a heated debate, as religious injunctions are brought in to separate the dimension of control from women.

Most women seeking abortions belong to poorer social stratas. Because they lack the resources, they are not able to pay the private fees for safe abortions. The services they seek through traditional Dayas is risky business, but women are helpless in seeking safer options.

The inaccessibility of health services and the refusal to provide them to women remains the biggest challenge in maternal health service. Most of the cases that reach the hospital are usually complicated due to incomplete abortions that were undertaken by midwives and back-alley doctors. Most of the cases undertaken are by the private sector health care providers that reach out to approximately 70% of the population that the public service sector cannot reach out to. However, in the private sector, the income matrix of women seeking help is detrimental in acquiring the quality of care.

There are a number of reasons why women seek abortions; most commonly, due to rape. Another reason is the low income of the household, and the inability of women to provide for their unborn children. In fact, most women seeking abortion live below the poverty line. The circumstances under which abortion is sought should not be ignored and facilities should be tailor-made to be more synchronised with the local needs of women seeking to undergo the procedure.

The government should take into consideration the various recommendations presented to it on the matter. The fact that the female morbidity rate is on the rise, means that rapid steps must be taken to redress the grievances of women in peril. The situation must be objectively overseen, with the consideration that women will get an abortion whether or not there is a ban on it. The stigmatization of abortions should be removed first, before coming to terms with a woman seeking the termination of her pregnancy. Post abortion care should be more systemized and streamlined in order to provide easy, accessible and essential care to those seeking abortions. All this cannot be done until the consent and will of women is made the profound basis in the conduction of abortion, and nobody else’s.

ISLAMABAD-Cardi B went live on Instagram to explain why she’ll continue to speak out against Donald Trump and why she will keep encouraging fans to vote in the upcoming election.

“I’m not gonna show my face on this video. I look like shit, I feel like shit. I’m a little sick,” she began during the unplanned live session, prompted by a Twitter tussle with conservative activist and Trump supporter Candace Owens.

“It’s not a secret that I use my platform for people to vote. I love politics. I endorse the Democratic party.,” Cardi said on Instagram Live.

The rapper then opened up about dealing with harassment from Trump followers. “They be degrading me,” she said. “They be making fun of me. I ignore them. Let me tell you something. Things get so intense that a Trump supporter posted my address and encouraged people to dox my home, to put my house on fire. I literally hired a private investigator, and serve them with a warrant and arrest this boy. She then responded to Owens’ comments about Cardi’s recent interview with Joe Biden. “Joe Biden used you. Bernie Sanders used you. Neither one of them like or know your music. They think you’re dumb,” Owens tweeted on Sunday. “When you stick to music, you can get left alone. When you dabble in politics, you will get called out for platforming ignorance,” Owens said in another tweet. “You’re saying Joe Biden is pandering because he’s using a popular figure like me,” said Cardi. “But your president, the guy that you love so much, he panders as well too.”",['Our Staff Report'],"I’m a little sick,” she began during the unplanned live session, prompted by a Twitter tussle with conservative activist and Trump supporter Candace Owens.

Five ""influential"" men allegedly gang-raped a child in a village in the Bhakkar district's Chak 60/61 ML, police confirmed on Monday.

According to the statement the Class 10 student recorded with the police, the men first kidnapped her from the fields, then took her to their den nearby, where they gang-raped her at gunpoint. The suspects also made a video of the entire incident. It is believed the men are landlords in the area.

They were so influential that she feared for her life, she said. The use of the video-recording device was to blackmail the victim, in case she tried to report what had happened her to the police. They said they would leak the video on to social media, she added.

The police has registered a case against the five since.

Earlier in August, a univety student in Multan claimed that she was raped and sexually assaulted by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz MPA, Atta-ur-Rehman. As in Bhakkar, Atta-ur-Rehman exterted an ""influence"", and allegedly threatened to leak videos of the victim on to social media if she were to ever share what he had done. When a police proceeding was initiated, it is believed the victim was forced to forgo claims of rape in her legal statement.

BY CAPT SHAHID HUSSAIN

TThe moment is epochal, as a Muslim sovereign inspects his armed forces as Commander-in-Chief for the first time ever, since 1858 AD, when Bahadur Shah-Zafar, the last emperor of India was finally deposed by the western imperialists. It is momentous, for it exemplifies the wave of resurgence that prevailed, and independence movements that were to follow, in the entire Asia, Africa, Middle and Far East in the face of western hegemony. As epitome of the forces of liberty Quaid-e-Azam is hallowed by the future Van Guard of the defenders of a nation, whose very inception was a manifestation of the right of self-determination of a people, and not a product of a military venture, and that was unparalleled in political history of nations.

The acute foresight of a statesman was vividly displayed by Quaid-e-Azam when he devoted most, in his deliberations and commitments, to the defense needs of emergent Pakistan within just over a year that he lived as the supreme leader. The advent of Pakistan was not only unique conceptually but geographically too. There were detractors critical of two wings divided by a hostile land, but for a great nation-builder these were ranklings of petty minds devoid of in-depth strategic insights and oblivious to the callings of muslim destiny of India. It’s not far-fetched that when Quaid-e-Azam finally decided to inspect his armed forces formally, it was Pakistan Navy. Notwithstanding that Naval Arm stood first in the order of seniority at the inception of Pakistan it was also imperative, it retained its predominant status commensurate with the emerging geography of Pakistan in particular, and geopolitical state of the Sub-Continent in general.

The unity of ‘two peoples’ inhabiting noncontiguous land, transcending all considerations of ethnicity and cultural diversity, uniting into a nation on principals of faith, was exceptional; if only, it could equally be matched by socio-economic magnanimity, political zeitgeist and synergic dynamism of Quaid-e-Azam by his successors. The military dimensions of the causes that lead to the separation of East Pakistan lay dormant in circumstances that involved the Army leadership into political activism. Negating the grand strategy of domination of the high seas and its vital sea lanes, with the ultimate aim to creating a blue sea navy as envisaged by Quaid-e-Azam and pursued by his immediate successors, the army leadership after having acquired political power evolved the doctrine of “the defense of east lies in west” giving central role to the Army, and consigning Navy into its secondary role of costal defense, and unilaterally placing Navy below army in the order of seniority of Arms. It was tragic that the strategic need of strong naval fleet armed with at least one carrier group, and bolstered by a mechanized army that thrived on mobility rather then number of troops - not to mention a viable tactical Air force equally poised in both wings - was over looked by the politicized military leadership of our nation. It was to be traded for a redundant policy of “strength in numbers” that never addressed the requirements of a qualitative, unified defensive approach with an overwhelming bias towards sustenance of lines of communications betwixt our two wings.

Brisk and resolute, and close at hand to Quaid-e-Azam, marches Lt Barkat Hussain, the parade commander and officer of the guard. Hailing from a clan of traditional soldiers, and a soil that bore many a sons that embellish the chapters of valor and gallantry in the annals of Pakistan’s Military history claiming the highest military honors; he possessed a military bearing not easy to emulate. This, complimented by an exceptional record of service and professional competence, qualified him to be the first ‘Joint Services Parade Commander’ of independent Pakistan. Proving his salt latter in the crucial years of early sixties he was to accomplish as its Commanding Officer the uphill task of recommissioning of the then de-commissioned P.N.S. Babur, the largest war ship and the only Battle Cruiser acquired by Pakistan Navy, and held the highest position in naval training as the ‘Director Naval Training’ in the crucial pre-war years that was instrumental in the out right success of ‘Battle of Dawarka’ and the unassailable position Pakistan Navy retained through out the first all out war in 1965 between Pakistan and India.

Rear Admiral James Wilfred Jafford, who follows, had the distinction of being the first C-in-C Royal Pakistan Navy; A diehard officer who had the interests of Pakistan navy close at heart unlike many of his British contemporaries.

He was most diligent and forthright in his dealings with Indian and British Governments in the initial raising and procurement of naval assets for Royal Pakistan Navy. It was for his devotion and affinity with the Nation of Pakistan that he was retained to command Pakistan Navy for two consecutive terms after independence.

Next proceeds Vice Admiral [then Commodore] H.M.S. Chaudhry, one of the most prodigious sons of Pakistan. He was the first Muslim to be commissioned in Royal Indian Navy and latter was to be the first Pakistani C-in-C Royal Pakistan Navy, and consequently Pakistan navy, after its redesignation in 1956. A paragon of moral and military courage he acted out feets of valor in naval combat beyond the call of duty as a young officer in Second World War. As C-in-C he would not relent in compromising the role of navy in the strategic defense needs of Pakistan in the face of critical opposition by the military rulers of the time. With utter disregard for personnel convenience, and in face of imminent threat to his carrier, he would persist in pursuing a defense policy that most suited and was envisaged by the founders of the Nation. This was to incur acute displeasure of the establishment that was pro Army. Indomitable till the last, he would maintain the high moral ground and resign the service in the best interest of the nation.

Seen next to him is Cdr Abdul Rashid who held important command and staff appointments in the formative years of Pakistan navy. Col Noles seen at the rear end was privileged to be the Military Secretary [MS] to the Quaid-e-Azam after independence.

Scouting the caravan are the two ADCs of Quaid-e-Azam. Lt Syed Mohammad Ahsan rose to the rank of Vice Admiral to be the third C-in-C Pakistan navy. He as the Governor of East Pakistan, along with Lt Gen Sahibzada Yaqub Khan Commander Eastern command were to be the lone voices of sanity in the gloomy year of 1971. He remained openly critical of the policies of the leadership in West Pakistan.

His exceptional strength of character in his refusal to endorse the militant stance of the government in West Pakistan, against the political unrest in East Pakistan, was not shared by those who wielded power, including many politicians. Finally the foresight of a visionary, who had remained in close liaison with the father of the nation, was in conflict with the short term and myopic leadership that forced him to relinquish his position, thereby removing a bulwark against the separation of East Pakistan. Remaining true to the lofty ideals set by his predecessors in the naval command, Admiral Ahsen, in his last stand, chose honor to expediency.

Capt Gul Hassan, who rose to the rank of a General to be the first COAS of Pakistan Army was, the best of military virtue and military tradition personified. Admired by officers and men alike for his charismatic leadership qualities, he set upon the task of salvaging the moral of a demoralized Army after the loss of East Pakistan. Having witnessed the pitfalls of military involvement into civil affairs, he resolved to show military’s strength in omission, rather then commission into political affairs of the nation. Ironically a stance that was call of the day and a boon for the future of democracy and civil rule was seen- paradoxically- as an attempt for an independence of military command by no other then the leadership of a new wave of democratic forces after a long interlude that was dominated by military rule. Remaining unwavering in his stance to carve out a professional army from the ashes of 1971 war, that was to have its final allegiance to the State rather then political governments, and exemplifying a military leadership that was non partisan and was a-political, Gen Gul Hassan left this lofty ideal to be pursued by his successors; as he was forced to relinquish his Command for living up to his principals, in the tradition of those other fore bearers who were to be the part of this caravan today.

14th of Aug 1947, when the largest Muslim nation state appeared on the world map with Quaid-e-Azam as its supreme leader, marks a day in the legacy of muslim civilization that once lit the breadths of the known world from Iberian peninsula at the shores of Atlantic to the farthest reaches of southeast Asia in pacific, and its lengths from Trans-Oxania to the heart of Africa. Never before had there been a global civilization that was steeped in arts and sciences, philosophy and jurisprudence. Pax Romana in earlier times could only govern through its military garrisons and laws, while Hellenic civilization in Aegean, and Vedic in India, that excelled in philosophy and sciences were never geographically extant.

The Dynamic spirit behind their lightning success that defined the Muslims and set them apart, were two imperatives namely “The Unity of God’ and “universal brotherhood”. Based on these simplified truths their excellence and creativity in philosophy and natural sciences was corollary to a deep sense of inquiry and an experimental approach towards sciences, making Islam congenial to the flowering of a civilization as never before.

obility and strength are the hallmarks of a civilizing people and the Muslims were pioneers in all aspects of maritime activity, turning Mediterranean into a Muslim lake, and commanded the Indian Ocean right through to the pacific, spreading Islamic culture and heritage into a global expanse.",[],"It’s not far-fetched that when Quaid-e-Azam finally decided to inspect his armed forces formally, it was Pakistan Navy.

https://nation.com.pk/30-May-2014/no-honor-in-honor-killing,2014-05-30 00:10:39+05:00,No honor in honor killing,"Share:

There is no honor in killing an innocent, unarmed woman or killing an unborn child or passively witnessing cold blooded murder. There is no honor in following custom that justifies or pardons a murderer. There is no honor in shrouding death with laws that tangle the arms and legs of justice.

Quite simply, there is no honor in honor killing. There is only shame. And while many of us will consider this a universal, undeniable truth, many more will disagree and therein lies the problem.

In Pakistan, after years of canvassing, in 2004, human rights activists were able to coerce the government in promulgating a law that criminalized all murders made under the name of ‘honor’; a law that promised to punish the perpetrators, aiders, abettors and supporters of such crimes. According to Aurat Foundation though – an NGO spearheading the struggle for the emancipation of women – the law ‘had no teeth’ which is why it failed to influence the number of honor killings in the country.

Maliha Zia Lari, a practicing lawyer and researcher on human rights, studied the efficacy of this law in four districts – Ghotki, Naseerabad, Nowshera and Gujrat – and in 2011 published findings in a report called ‘Honor Killings in Pakistan and Compliance of Law’.

Among several insights about the complexion of honor killings and the challenges associated with discouraging crimes against women, the report reveals that a majority of people do not know about the law promulgated in 2004, and ‘what is far worse is that this ignorance also exists within the fundamental players of the justice sector, including the police, lawyers and even the judges’.

The most recent substantiation of Maliha’s finding was when 25-year old Farzana Iqbal and her unborn child were killed outside the guarded gates of the Lahore High Court just a few days ago. At least twelve offenders, including the victim’s father and brothers, beat Farzana to death because she exercised her own free will and married ‘another man’ named Muhammad Iqbal. When the offenders fired shots in the air no one came to Farzana’s help – not the silent bystanders, not the police, not even her husband. Furthermore, eleven of the twelve offenders somehow miraculously got away without a scratch from the police.

A number of fundamental lacunas makes the Honor Killing Act ineffective which means that the killers of Farzana Iqbal and her unborn child will probably continue to roam the streets unharmed, just like numerous other criminals who have murdered women in the name of honor.

The most obvious gap in the Criminal Law (Amendments) Act 2004 is the provision for waivers. Crimes committed between close members of the family are compoundable which essentially means that if the heirs of the victim choose to forgive the offender, the offender can pay a certain fee and walk away. When a criminal is both offender and heir to the victim, this provision fails to make sense, let alone deliver justice. Furthermore, punishment for honor killing is not mandatory which makes the entire purpose of introducing the legislation redundant.

Tahira S. Khan in her book ‘Beyond Honor’ gathers expert legal opinion on the matter to assert that the existing laws ‘leave ample space for judicial gender biases to intervene and result in lenient sentences to murderers and facilitate compromises which allow perpetrators to get away with minimal or no penalty’.

Legislation, as redundant as it may be on this matter, can only but assist a small percentage of the victims since a large number of crimes go unreported. There is a strange ‘culture of silence’ in our society that forbids us from commenting on issues related to ‘ghairat’ and honor. In districts like Nowshera for example, where honor killing is prevalent and acknowledged as an acceptable practice by its residents, not a single FIR was registered to report a crime between 2005 and 2010.

According to a representative of Noor Education Trust, ‘women are killed in the name of honor but are buried silently and the matter is kept hidden’. Police officers (interviewed by Maliha Lari, the author of Honor Killings in Pakistan and the compliance of Law) say they often find dead bodies of women murdered by gunfire in the river. Subsequently, the case file is marked ‘unknown dead body’ and in the absence of any interest from the family of the deceased or the community at large, investigations are rarely followed.

In most cases, the pressure to use violence against women who act ‘out of line’ stems from the collective disapproval of a community the offender is very much a part of. So in many ways, the community aids the crime and when it comes down to investigation, people simply refuse to testify against the criminal. For this reason, several cases of honor crimes are settled before they reach the court and men who have actually murdered in the name of honor become custodians of an established social order.

To counter and ultimately squash crime in the name of honor, amendments to improve the Honor Killing Act will be critical but not enough. Law enforcers that watched Farzana Iqbal die should be punished. Media that went silent after reporting the crime should follow up on the issue and it should educate people about the Honor Killing Act. Schools, colleges and offices should practice equity and recognize women as equal members of society. Violence against women should be discussed and discouraged in religious gatherings.

Sounds like a tall order considering Farzana Iqbal is already off the media radar. But before you take her off yours, consider this: only a fraction of the recommendations above could help protect an innocent life. It is a shame we couldn’t protect Farzana Iqbal but maybe by telling her story we can begin to change minds and eventually save similar, equally vulnerable lives.

Rawalpindi-A judicial magistrate on Tuesday sent 4 suspects including 3 policemen allegedly involved in gang rape of a 21-year-old woman to jail on judicial remand after the complainant told the judge that the four had not assaulted her sexually.

The woman also filed a fresh application with the court pleading to record her statement under section 164 of CrPc again.

Source disclosed to The Nation that Rawat police hde implicated the 3 cops and a civilian in a bogus rape case in order to save the skin of real culprit, reportedly ASI Zain, posted as Moharrar in Police Station Rawat.

Earlier, a team of Rawat police headed by Sub Inspector Kausar produced the 4 accused Naseer, Rashid Minhas, Azeem (the policemen) and Amir before the court. The inquiry officer told the court that police had recovered Rs2,000 cash from the accused and their further custody was required for 5 more days for recovery of the cash they had stolen from the victim.

Opposing the police plea, Advocate Malik Ajmal Awan, defence council, told the court that the woman had reverted from her statements during the last hearing and today she again told the court that the 4 men were not her rapists.

He argued that police had falsely implicated his clients in the case and requested the court to not grant the police physical remand of the four men and send them on judicial remand.

At this, the judicial magistrate Arshad sent the suspects on judicial remand in Adiala Jail and directed the police to submit complete challan on next hearing.

Separately, the court accepted the application of Rafia Azam and recorded her statement again. In her statement, she told the magistrate that she had appeared before the court of Sumaira Alamgir on May 24 and recorded her statement under influence and pressure of media and representative of NGOs and these elements forced her to record statement as per their choice.

“Now I want to record my statement before the learned court according to my free will and consent without any pressure and influence from any side,” she added.

She told the judge that she did not know names of the accused before registration of FIR rather all the accused were nominated in the FIR on the instigation of police and representatives of the NGOs. “The nominated accused were not involved in the crime,” Rafia Azam stated before the judge. She asked the court to grant bails to the accused. However, the judge sent the accused on judicial remand.

On the other hand, sources revealed that Rafia Azam had lodged a complaint with the CPO Faisal Rana on May 17 accusing a cop Zain and his accomplices of raping her in a car. She also alleged that Zain and others subjected her and her cousin Umair Azam Kiani to severe torture and hurled threats of dire consequences, they said. They mentioned that the CPO forwarded the complaint to SDPO Saddar Circle asking him to probe the allegations and submit inquiry report within 3 days.

Interestingly, SDPO conducted the inquiry in a hasty manner and implicated 3 cops and a civilian in the FIR and arrested them instead of grilling the main suspect, Zain, they added.

Rawat police booked and held 4 suspects on complaint of Rafia Azam, who accused them of raping her in a case in Bahria Town Phase 8 and snatching gold ring and Rs30,000 cash from her.

Meanwhile, Superintendent of Police Saddar Capt (R) Rai Mazhar Iqbal on Tuesday said that the police would file an application with court requesting to send the gang rape victim to Darul Aman for her security.

He added that police have been interrogating the gang rape case involving 3 cops from all angles and purely on merit. Come what may, the accused would be brought to justice, he added.

He said that the victim and the four accused would also be taken to Lahore on June 26 for polygraph test to ascertain the truth.

The SP expressed these views while addressing a press conference at Police Station Saddar Bairooni.

Flanked by DSP Saddar Circle Farhan Aslam, SHO PS Rawat Raja Aizaz and Investigation Officer of the gang rape case SI Kausar, SP Rai Mazhar said that police lodged FIR against four accused including 3 cops stationed in PS Rawat on complaint of Rafia Azam, the victim, and brought both parties for conducting medical in hospital. He added that the police have collected all substantial evidences in the case and produced it before the court for further proceeding.

“Police are with the victim and would also help her out in getting justice,” he said, adding that an application would also be filed before the court to send the victim to Darul Aman to keep her safe from pressure groups and to produce her before court for recording her new statement under section 164 of CrPC.

He said that the investigators were not showing negligence in the interrogation or giving any favour to rape accused cops.

On a query, the SP replied that police highlighted the accused cops instead of hiding them from media. He pledged the victim would be brought justice at any cost.",['Israr Ahmad'],"At this, the judicial magistrate Arshad sent the suspects on judicial remand in Adiala Jail and directed the police to submit complete challan on next hearing.

He said that the investigators were not showing negligence in the interrogation or giving any favour to rape accused cops.","['case', 'remand', 'azam', 'takes', 'court', 'statement', 'victim', 'accused', 'judicial', 'rafia', 'rape', 'told', 'sent', 'turn']","{'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/rsss.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/android_app_on_play_logo_small.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/g_plus.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/linkedin_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2019-05-28/-thanks-god-now-going-back-rs-1559066574-4496.jpg', 'https://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619912693.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/twitter.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png?date=2019-02-15', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_publishrr.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/utube.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/uploads/theme/logo-1550475639.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619902433.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/whatsapp_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/facebook.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/app-store.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png'}",True,https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg,1,,,,,nation
https://nation.com.pk/22-Apr-2018/590955,2018-04-22 00:01:43+05:00,Forced Marriage – a bilateral offence,"Share:

Everywhere in the world, marriage without consent or against the consent of the boy or girl is illegal. All over the world, every religion, customary and conventional law, have declared marriage as a civil contract. However, we deliberately neglect the prerequisite of a civil contract that is; a free will to contract of the parties. Therefore a civil contract without free will is void and revocable under law. Religiously speaking, Islam also does not allow forced marriages and it’s an offence under Pakistani laws.

The Muslim community has many reservations on the campaign of forced marriages. They believe that the parents have a right to decide the marriages of their child. As a cultural norm, they accept that under the prevailing circumstance in EU, UK and other foreign countries, the concept of love marriage of their daughters with a stranger or non Muslim is an intolerable notion. They believe that reaction is natural.

Sanctity of culture, tradition and religious rituals are sustainable factors, which cannot be softening without education and consistent interaction with modern civilization. The Muslim families settle in the UK temporarily for economic and livelihood purposes, but their children grow up with a different mindset. Muslim families are not responding too well to their children’s response to the social and cultural environment of western foreign countries.

Perhaps, the biggest problem in forced marriage is the traditional approach of the parents and other family members. Parents feel ashamed to address and discuss marriage issues with their daughters. Whereas, if the parents do ask or consult with the daughters, majority of the girls support the parents decision, while only a minority deny it while giving good reasons to refuse a marriage proposal.

The parents, particularly those in the Muslim community residing abroad should review their approach. Knowing the culture of the West, parents should regularly discuss these issues confidently with their children so they can understand each other’s point of views, feelings and fears. This may pave the way to a mutual decision between the parents and children, who can make up their mind together while settling what issues, may arise, thereby avoiding commitments with others.

Forced marriages are common in Pakistan. The menace does not only affect people in Pakistan, but also puts to suffering, people residing outside Pakistan, who are settled in foreign countries. They marry their sons and daughters against their consent to members of their family in Pakistan for various purposes, mostly to help get members of their family citizenship of the foreign country. Another possible purpose behind this could be family settlement of properties and mutual benefits of involved parties.

Recently, a new tendency has surfaced with regards to forced marriages, where the marriages are based on conspiracies to abducting a minor child. Forced marriages with these motives usually takes place in remote areas where poor girls are married off just for the sake of a child. The parties involved in this marriage normally pick orphaned or poor, illiterate girls with two temptations; the first relating to the girl being chosen possessing certain noble and pious qualities. They further manage this marriage while denying any need for dower or other expenses for the marriage. While this may seem like a good intentions from the boy’s family what hides behind this false humbleness to deceive the girl’s family is many a times the plan to return the girl back to Pakistan by deceiving her visiting her home country for the holidays and then abandoning her there. This chain of events is very tactfully conducted with the help of the boy or one of his family members, who accompany the girl on her visit to Pakistan but after a few days very cleverly, returns the foreign country with the minor child and the travel documents of the girl. Then the child remains with the family of the boy. Since the girl does not have any documents allowing her to travel back to her in laws, she is left with no option but to stay in Pakistan.

According to the British government, forced marriage is defined as one in which either one or both parties are forced to marry after being subjected to physical or mental torture or being victims to financial threats. According to the data provided by the British government the number of forced marriage between Pakistani and British people is abnormally higher than those between British citizens and foreigners from other countries.

In Pakistan, several young girls/women are forced into wed-lock against their consent. Pakistan is a Muslim country, and Islam gives full rights to girls to marry as per their own discretion, still we fail to follow Islam, and this injustice against women is continuing. The Constitution of Pakistan prohibits under-age marriages. No boy under 18 and no girl under 16 are allowed to marry. Unfortunately, the laws are only enacted, but no one is willing to act upon these laws which can protect women and young girls.

The British Interior Ministry and foreign office formed a Forced Marriage Unit. The British Government is considering introducing legislation against expatriate parents who force their daughters to marry according to the parents’ choice. The plan is to make forced marriage a criminal offence. In this context, the family members of the other party to the marriage should also be charged under abetment in forced marriages. Because parents from both sides intentionally aid to prepare this conspiracy.

The administrative authorities (Union Councils) and public servants who register the marriages and supervise marriage ceremonies (Nikka Khuwa-person administering the marriage rituals of contract) also fall within the ambit of abetment if they do not follow the rules of Nikkah (Contract). The public servants can become an interface in forced marriages and play an instrumental role in ensuring that girls are not under- age and they are being contracted in marriages out of their own free will. In case they have any cause to believe that an abuse of the Marriage Act or the marriage registration rules is taking place, they can make it a point to report to the police. This will help to curb the practice and punish anyone who violates the laws.

The new legislation will only help the Muslim community living in UK, particularly Pakistanis who make up the majority of the Muslim community. This legislative move however can no longer be effective without parallel legislation in Pakistan. Pakistan must move to correct the situation and cooperate with the British government in overcoming problems of introversion within the Pakistani community residing in UK. This can be done by improving the laws in Pakistan relating to marital coercion, which is expressly banned by Islam.

In Pakistan, forced marriage is against the law and abetment is also an offence under the Pakistan Penal code, 1860. These incidents mostly take place due to parental influence and fiat. If the girl does dare to get married without parental permission, she faces maltreatment and is also sometimes hunted down by her parents and subjected to punishments in various forms including honor killing, stove burning and sudden “accidental” death and disappearances.

To effectively control this menace at the state level, Pakistan and UK both under treaty series should sign an agreement on Forced marriage. Both countries’ domestic laws should prohibit forced marriage and treat the practice as a criminal offence. The guidelines and rules should also be designed to enforce this agreement through relevant ministries of both the countries. Both the states under this treaty may declare pre-marriage registration compulsory in the respective country. The procedure should follow a prescribed form to be filed while providing an undertaking that the marriage is being solemnized with the free will of the both the parties. This mechanism will frustrate the arrangement of forced marriages from the beginning till the end. The complaints of forcibly married girls to authorities can also be verified in this way.

In Pakistan and UK, in fact, traditional marriages lead to a situation where women have practically no voice even in perhaps the most important of decisions, the ones that have far -reaching effects on their lives. Due to the perception and fear of quick disengagement of marriage contracted outside families and community, the parents prefer cousin marriages which they believe and expect to make the family life of their daughters safe and happy.

Secondly forced marriage is a symbol to show supremacy and face saving in certain communities. The façade of having chosen an appropriate spouse gives an unhappy and disturbed family life to innocent girls. This, later on, also develops an outcome which often takes the shape of torture, domestic violence, honor killing, divorce or separation in the family. Reportedly, and in truth, forced marriages are failed marriages.

Forced marriage is an evil practice, a century’s old custom that needs to be laid to rest. Girls must be allowed to complete their schooling and attain high quality education for a quality life for both the parents and children. Parents must also obtain free and full consent from their children before contracting them into marriages, as it is their legal as well as their religious right to have a say in the decision which makes up for remaining better part of their life and future.

GANDA SINGH WALA - Punjab’s leading child protection official has called for a federal inquiry into ‘the largest-ever child abuse scandal in Pakistan’s history’ after the discovery of 400 videos recording more than 280 children being forced to have sex. Most of the victims were under 14 but include a six year old boy who was forced to perform a homosexual act and a 10 year old schoolgirl who was filmed being molested by a 14 year old boy.

Our reporter Ashraf Javed gives details of his exclusive front page story in The Nation today. http://t.co/8zXtT7ZNgI pic.twitter.com/qRJsRCCnVK — Rameeza Majid Nizami (@RameezaNizami) August 8, 2015

Videos of these assaults were filmed and thousands of copies are believed to have been sold for Rs50 each in Hussain Khanwala village in Kasur district. One of the victims said he was injected in the spine with a drug before he was assaulted.

The scale of the scandal emerged earlier this week after the victims’ parents clashed police during a protest against their failure to prosecute the men who orchestrated the scandal. Two dozen people were injured when police used force to disperse more than 4,000 protesters on the Dipalpur Road near Dolaywala village in Kasur district on Tuesday who were calling for justice for the victims.

They have claimed that local police have tried to cover up the scandal and that the perpetrators have used their influence to avoid being charged.

Saba Sadiq, head of Punjab’s Child Protection Bureau, described the case as “the largest-ever child abuse scandal in Pakistan’s history” and said a provincial inquiry announced by the chief minister “would be taken up at federal level to safeguard the children rights in future.”

The number of victims in this child abuse ring is almost three times higher than in the case of Javed Iqbal in the late 1990s when around 100 children were sexually abused and murdered in Lahore. Saba Sadiq said the provincial government would change the law to ensure “vigorous punishment for such criminals.”

So far only six alleged abusers have been arrested, five of whom have been remanded in custody but according to parents of the victims the abuse was orchestrated by a gang of up to 25 young men and teenagers led by two men in their 40s.

The gang arranged the abuse, perpetrated it in many cases, and then used the videotapes of the assaults to blackmail the children and their families to hand over millions of rupees. Many of the children stole gold ornaments from their parents to pay off their abusers to keep their ordeal secret.

Police sources said the main suspect had been released after a Rs5 million bribe was paid on his behalf and victims families said they had been subjected to pressure by a local political figure to withdraw the allegations.

One mother aged 35, said she had to sell her gold ornaments to pay Rs 600,000 to the blackmailers for the videos of her 14 year old son being abused to be erased. “They made the video of my son in 2011. We have been paying money to the blackmailers for the last four years. I have seen the videos. It was disgusting and shameful,” she said with tears rolling down her cheeks. “We are seriously thinking to set our houses on fire and leave the locality.”

A 10-year-old said he was taken to a haveli by the gang at gunpoint. “After being brutally tortured, I was administered “spinal injection” and I was dozing when five to six men molested me one by one,” he said.

The police have arrested a 13-year-old boy for having sex with another child. His mother said her son is innocent because he committed the crime under duress. “They (producers of the clips) not only molested the children themselves but they also asked the victims to rape each other on camera,” she told The Nation.

“Everyone in this village is a victim. Our children both boys and girls are raped and blackmailed,” said another victim’s mother.

LAHORE - Minister for Health Dr Yasmin Rashid has said that disclosure of gender of baby during pregnancy would be prohibited through legislation for checking heinous trend of abortion in case of girl.

Addressing a seminar on “ending gender based violence” arranged by Punjab Government in collaboration with UNWOMEN on Saturday, she regretted that some people were misusing the technology of ultrasound to know about sex of baby in advance to decide whether to go for delivery or abortion.

Dr Yasmin Rashid said that the Holy Prophet (PBUH) had condemned burying baby girls and abortion was the same. “Islam provides equal rights to woman folk, let’s implement Islamic teachings in letter and spirit”, she said. Quoting example of Prime Minister Imran Khan, she said, he was the person who acknowledges role of his mother in his success in practical life. “Establishment of Shoukat Khanum Cancer Hospital was a proof of his love for his late mother. She said that no society could move forward without empowering women. “Violence against a woman disturbs the whole family and the society.

Even women in developed countries like USA were not safe. Pakistan stood at number six in list of countries where gender based violence was a common practice”, she said.",['Our Staff Reporter'],"Share:LAHORE - Minister for Health Dr Yasmin Rashid has said that disclosure of gender of baby during pregnancy would be prohibited through legislation for checking heinous trend of abortion in case of girl.

https://nation.com.pk/31-Jul-2020/factors-that-make-women-vulnerable-to-victimization,2020-07-31 19:04:00+05:00,Factors that make women vulnerable to victimization,"Share:

We often hear that women are being victimized by abuse, domestic violence, harassment, injustice, exploitation and many other problems in the modern world. Whether it is friendship, relationship, business, household or any other purpose, women are always the sufferers. So, the question arises, why? Why are women always oppressed? Why is this world so unfair to females?

By nature women are more emotional. They think from heart rather than using their mind. In every state, a woman has her emotional levels greater than anything else and she uses these sentiments for taking decisions as well. Whether she is a mother, sister, a girlfriend or wife, she has a sensitive attachment to the concerned person and will always try to resolve things peacefully by letting go. This causes her more harm as people take advantage of her and then leave. Women who are more practical and realistic tend to be more successful in their lives as they make decisions by analyzing all facts. Being a slave to your emotions and having no control over them can lead to risky consequences.

It is common for women to trust people for no reason. Not only in relationships but in common dealing and matters as well, women believe people without any reason, which leads to their exploitation. Trusting blindly is one of the women’s biggest mistakes – they do and then regret. Mostly in relationships, girls have faith in their partners up to an extent that they do not see the reality and other factors which are in front of them. For them everything is as their partners show them. They do not believe their parents, or friends, as far as their relationship is concerned. When their trust is broken, they realize that they trusted the wrong person, but it’s too late by then – they have been emotionally and mentally exploited enough. The pain of a heart break for a woman is not easy to bear, but till that time all she can do is regret the past and be careful for the next time.

It is often said that women are bad at keeping secrets. It does not seem a big deal, but it makes a huge difference. Women are more likely to open up to their partners rather than anyone else,and it is obvious that they would trust their partners the most. They usually fail to keep their personal affairs, family matters, individual space and professional life hidden from their spouses or boyfriends, which gives them a chance to blackmail or attack the women personally whenever they have a fight or going through a breakup. Keeping personal space is very important in relationships, or even in marriages, because no matter how good your partner is, he might not remain the same forever. Telling your secrets to people is like giving them a key to access your heart; they may keep it or break it anytime they want.

One of the most prominent facts is that women – especially in the eastern world – have less exposure to the world as compared to men. They are not as practical and think whatever they see or being told by their family or friends. On the other hand, men are more sensible at making decisions. They do not believe what they just see, but make their choices by making proper analysis of the circumstances and future consequences. So when it comes to making the life decision, women are most likely to fall for guys they like without pondering over the other factors like family, future, financial status etc. It might be the cause as to why they get exploited easily – emotionally or financially. However, later in their married life, they regret the decision.

One of the chief reasons for victimization of women is that they are not financially and emotionally independent. Even a modern and working woman needs a man to make her living, as the society does not allow women to live individually. When one cannot take decisions on her own, is not allowed to do anything without permission, is not able to lead a life of her own choice, how can you expect her not to be the victim of issues like domestic abuse, sexual and financial exploitation or harassment? This is because the majority of the women do not have any backup support, or anywhere to go, except the husband’s house so she has to compromise anyway.

Many women live in a world of fantasy. It seems very irrational but this is an element not to be ignored. Women usually visualize their lives based on novels and dramas where a prince charming enters her life and makes everything beautiful for her:Cinderella’s prince changed her life and they lived happily ever after. Unfortunately in real life, nothing like this happens. Famous characters of novels like Salaar, Jehan Sikander, Edward Cullen – someone who loves the girl, fights for her, treats her like a princess and so on. His charming looks, a height of 6 feet, army uniform, bold character and romantic feelings are the fantasies that every girl has, and when any of these gets fulfilled they start visualizing the same life they have seen in stories. Sadly, life is much bitter, and when it shows the true colors, poor girls’ hearts have already been broken.

Women are more emotional by nature and always have a soft corner for the ones they love. No matter how bad has been done to them in the past, when it comes to forgiving, they easily forgive the person and give him another chance just by seeing his tears. For them a crying man is a symbol of being guilty rather than improving his actions. When people know that another chance will be given to them, they keep repeating the same actions, because they know how to justify them. They play blame game by acting as a victim and blaming their partner for their abusive behavior and actions. They know that their partner is not going to leave them and will be easily convinced. Women are not firm on their decisions to leave a person permanently;they just keep giving warnings and second chances and keep getting disappointed on false hopes that they would change.

It is said that men move on more easily as compared to women. One of its main reasons is that men accept the reality and are more realistic. They keep themselves engaged in their work and routine so that they forget things easily. On the other hand, women keep thinking about the past – how happy they were before, how people were before, why did everything change – and keep blaming themselves or others for what happened rather than accepting the reality and letting go. They get more emotionally attached to someone they love and take more time to move on, which is the main reason that they keep on being deceived on the hope that things can turn back to be normal.

Majority of the women especially in the east are taught that their husbands are their God. They have to obey them in every matter and because of that women suffer a lot. They have to tolerate everything even that is unjust, just because of their partner’s wish. At some point women become so used to the injustice done to them, that they teach their daughters the same thing and the trend goes on and on. In the eastern world, women are blamed for destroying their married life so they keep on bearing the abuse of their husbands and in-laws just because of the fear that their married life would get damaged.

This is a natural fact that women are physically weaker than men. They are powerless in many cases just because of their gender and have to be silent. The fact that a large number of women are raped, harassed, acid attacked, kidnapped, beaten and killed by men is because as they are helpless owing to the difference in physical strength. Sexual exploitation of women is also very common in marriages or relationships because of the same reason. Especially in the eastern countries, where the law and order situation is full of corruption, it is not easy for women to get justice.",['Zoha Masood'],"Women who are more practical and realistic tend to be more successful in their lives as they make decisions by analyzing all facts.

Reports are circulating that a former staffer of Joe Biden is accusing the Democratic presidential candidate of sexual assault in the 1990s.

Former Senate staffer Tara Reade had previously accused the candidate of unwanted physical touching but recently filed a report saying Biden sexually assaulted her.

“Please Republicans do not use my assault for political gain. Help me pressure [media outlets] to question Joe Biden,” Reade tweeted a day before the Associated Press released a report about the alleged sexual assault.

Reade was one of eight women who came forward last year and accused the presidential hopeful of inappropriate touching. The candidate later apologized and said he’d be more mindful about personal space.

The former staffer had accused Biden of inappropriate actions, like massaging her neck and playing with her hair. Now, news outlets are reporting that she filed a police report in Washington about an alleged sexual assault that occurred in 1993.

She told the Associated Press that he pushed her against the wall and penetrated her with his finger.

Rawalpindi - A 24-year-old girl died yesterday when she was thrown out from the window of a residential flat located on the third floor of a plaza located in the largest private housing society of the country.

Police said the girl was allegedly raped before she was thrown out of the flat. The alleged murderer of the girl was also arrested by police after filing a case on the complaint of the brother of the deceased.

The murder accused was identified as Umair Imtiaz alias Makki. He hails from Vehari. He was shifted to a hospital for treatment as he also sustained injuries. The deceased girl was identified as Tahmina Kausar who was a resident of Mohalla Imambargah Sirpak, Chakwal.

According to Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Sajid Gondal, the incident took place at 4:00am. “The skull bone of girl was fractured while there was less blood on the place from where her dead body was recovered,” he said. He said that during initial report it was suggested that the girl was raped before she was thrown out of the window. However, police are waiting for final medical report, he said. He said that police also arrested Umair, the alleged killer, and shifted him to a hospital as he also sustained injuries.

The boy stated before the investigators that he had married Tehmian but he failed to produce marriage certificate when demanded. “The accused also stated that the girl was suffering from various diseases including hysteria,” the police officer said. He said that the accused also told police that two friends of him were present at the flat in the night but they went out after dinner and he and Tehmina were alone in the flat.

Sharing further details, the DSP said that the girl came to Rawalpindi from Chakwal on November 18 along with her grandfather for his medical check-up from a hospital. After getting medicines, the girl sent her grandfather back to Chakwal and made a phone call to her mother that she would go to Islamabad to get his degree from the university.

“Tehmina Kausar did masters in defence and strategic studies from Qauid-e-Azam University,” he said. He said that after sending her grandfather back to home, she went to Umair Makki with whom she contacted on a social media website Facebook two years ago and later developed friendship.

The accused holds MBA and law degrees and was also helping her in preparation for CSS, he said.

“At first, the couple stayed at Best Western Hotel in the federal capital and then they arrived at a flat number 58, located on the 3rd floor of Shehzad Arcade,” the DSP said adding that during this the girl kept her mother informing on phone that she was staying in the QAU and would come back to Chakwal after getting her degree.

The police officer said that Adnan, brother of the deceased, lodged a complaint before police and stated that her sister went missing three days ago. He also added that she was unmarried. Police registered a murder case against Umair on the complaint of Adnan.

Investigation officer, Sub-Inspector Zaheeruddin Babar, when contacted, said that Tehmina phoned her mother on November 20 that Umair along with two of his friends detained her in a flat and was forcing her for marriage. Upon this, her mother sent her brother Adnan and two other persons to get her back to home.

Babar said when the victim’s brother and his companions reached the plaza, they heard screams of his sister and soon after this, she was allegedly thrown from out from the third floor, he said.

“The girl was taken to District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital where the doctors pronounced her dead,” he told. He said that after the post mortem, the dead body was handed over to her heirs for burial in Chakwal.

“Umair was trying to run away from the crime scene while climbing down but was held by the security guards,” he said and added he received some injuries in his feet when he rolled down from the stairs of the first floor. “The accused is still in DHQ Hospital and being treated by doctors,” he said.

The police had traced record of the accused and investigation on modern techniques was being carried out. A police spokesman released pictures of both the suspects on the social media on Saturday evening. The suspects are identified by police as Abid Ali, a resident of Fort Abbas, Bahawalnagar and Waqar-ul-Hassan, who belongs to Qila Sattar, Sheikhupura.

The IG said other law enforcement agencies, including the CTD, were also conducting raids to arrest the accused at the earliest.

He claimed that the victim, who is a foreign national, thought it was safe to travel at night with her kids. He also said the victim was at fault for ""choosing the route she took and not checking her petrol tank"" before heading out.

Meanwhile, PML-N leader Malik Mohammad Ahmed Khan on Saturday filed a petition in the Lahore High Court (LHC) seeking to submit additional documents in an earlier petition challenging the appointment of Lahore Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Umar Sheikh. Ahmed is seeking the court's approval to submit additional evidence in the primary petition filed by him on Wednesday that challenged the Punjab government's decision to remove Shoaib Dastgir from the post of inspector general of police after he developed differences with the Lahore CCPO.

Ahmed's first petition in the LHC argued that pre-mature transfers in the police force violated the Police Order (2002) and the Punjab government's rules of business.

karachi - An 8-year-old boy was killed and about one dozen others including five children were wounded in back-to-back explosions in Orangi Town late on Sunday.

Police said the third bombing proved deadly after extra contingent of law enforcers including police and Rangers reached the site following two low-intensity explosions near Jafria Imambargah in Qasba Colony within the limits of Pirabad Police Station.

As a result, a boy who was later identified as Aqib was killed and around one dozen including at least five children were wounded. The victims were moved to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital. Police said that the first two explosions were of hand-grenades thrown by armed motorcyclists near Imambargah while the third one was improvised explosive device.

The SHO said the victims were on their way to a wedding function. Bomb disposal squad experts also reached the site and collected the evidences. The BDS experts said that the IED weighing around half kg explosive including ball bearings was planted at a garbage dump. Police and Rangers cordoned off the area while further investigation was underway.

Orangi SP Sajid Sadozai said the actual target of the bombings has yet to be ascertained. He said that a few months ago, the same Imambargah was targeted in a similar attack.

TERROR BID FOILED AS BDS DEFUSES BOMB IN ORANGI TOWN

A Bomb Disposal Squad team on Sunday managed to foil a terror by defusing a bomb planted in Orangi Town.

The bomb, concealed in a cement block, was planted near a teashop. Being informed, police and BDS personnel reached the spot and cordoned off the area. Fear and panic gripped the locality when the residents knew about the bomb. According to BDS officials, sparks were emerging from the bomb when they reached the site.

“It seems the terrorists tried to explode the bomb but due to some technical fault, it could not go off.” However, the BD experts, with the efforts of at least one hour, managed to defuse the bomb. They said that a cell phone device was attached with the bomb for exploding purpose; however, fortunately, it could not be exploded.

Police have yet to ascertain whether the general public, law enforcers or any political party was the target. A case has been registered while further investigation was underway.

Separately, two people were killed in separate acts of violence in the city. A rickshaw driver was shot dead in an act of target killing in Islamia Colony of Orangi Town within the limits of Pirabad police station. Police said that at least two armed men riding a motorcycle targeted the rickshaw driver, killing him on the spot. The deceased was later identified as Aurangzeb, 30.

BAHAWALNAGAR-An influential landlord abducted a girl and made her subject to gang-rape while later declared her as ""vani"" through a panchayat to avenge her brother for contracting love marrige with the landlord's daughter.

The Takhat Mahal Police appeared to have colluded with the accused in the entire episode and did not take any action to avert the incident and bring the culprits to the book, despite complaints by the affected family.

According to the affected girl Tasleem, daughter of Allah Rakha, the incident occurred in Mauza Noor Muhammad Bhangran, tehsil and district, started with her abduction on January 31, 2017.

Tasleem informed that her brother Fayyaz got love marriage with Parveen Bibi, daughter of Hakim Ali, influential landlord of Mauza Noor Muhammad Bhangran, against the consent of elders of both the families.

The marriage took place on January 15, 2017, upon which Parveen's family hurled threats to Fayyaz's family of revenge. To settle a score with Fayyaz and his family ""for the disgrace caused to the family,"" Hakim Ali, Arif and some others members of the girl's family raided house of Tasleem Bibi and abducted her at gunpoint on January 31, 2017. The victim informed that the culprits took her to an undisclosed location where she was gang-raped during six days captivity.

In meanwhile one Shabir reported the abduction to police through a call on emergency service 15, but the police did nothing to recover the girl or go after the influential culprits. The victim family also approached the Takht Mahal Police, in person, for justice, but the police turned a deaf ear to the complaint.

Seven days later, the abductors with the connivance of influential persons of the area, convened a panchayat and declared the abducted girl as ""vani."" Influential landlord Muhammad Ali also forced Allah Rakha, Tasleem's father to accept the panchayat decision, lest he would have to pay a penalty of Rs5 million. They also got sign of the affected father on a written reconciliation agreement forcibly. On the other hand, the abductors who had subjected Tasleem to gang rape, forcibly married off to Khuda Yar, nephew of Hakim Ali, in a bid ""to sweep the entire episode under the carpet."" The victim family, however, managed to get an FIR registered through a court order, six months after the incident. Despite lodging the FIR, the Takhat Mahal Police ""sided with the influential accused"" and neither included appropriate sections i.e Vani and gang rape in the case, nor arrested any of the accused allegedly after receiving bribe.

The accused approached the court of Additional District and Sessions judge for bails, but the court rejected their application. Later, the accused approached the High Court Bahawalpur bench for bail, but the apex court rejected their petition and upheld the sessions court verdict. The learned court also directed the police to add vani section (310A) to the case.

When contacted newly-posted DPO Ataur Rehman claimed that justice would be done in the case and anybody found involved in the case would be bring to the book. He also ordered the police to add vani section to the FIR and arrested the panchayat head.

Meanwhile, District Police PRO Asif Saeed informed that that after rejection of bail pleas of 10 accused including Alam Ali, son of Haji Ghulam Ali; Zahoor Ahmad, son of Haji Ghulam Qadir; Hakim Ali, son of Haji Ghulam Qadir; Qasim Ali, son of Haji Ghulam Qadir; Muhammad Iqbal, son of Dhulay Khan; Muhammad Khan, son of Dhulay Khan; Dhulay Khan, son of Manjay Khan etc are on remand in police custody.

https://nation.com.pk/10-Oct-2015/a-forewarning-story-of-misogyny,2015-10-09 23:07:13+05:00,A forewarning story of misogyny,"Share:

The past week brought forth the most startling of news one could imagine from the already steady stream of surprises - “12 year old girl beaten to death by father and brother.” The only thing more devastating than the tragedy itself was the cause of it. The young girl, later identified as Aniqa Khalid, was murdered because apparently her “rotis” were not round enough. Not only does this instance signify the prevalent cruelty in Pakistan, it also puts into question the uncertain status of women in our society.

The Pakistani society is plagued with instances of domestic violence: forceful marriages of underage girls, rape cases, and a list of such crimes that is apparently a never-ending one. Sadly, a Pakistani girl’s life is replete with instances of gender discrimination if not the more disturbing accounts of domestic violence. Much of the inequality can be attributed to a long standing gender norms and roles that have dictated the lives of Pakistani women. Even in this day and age, the woman who spends most of her time stranded within the confines of her kitchen earns a status much elevated than that of a woman who is career oriented; the reason being that gender roles surrounding Pakistani woman require her to be a homemaker. Throughout her adolescence she is taught to be passive and submissive. Her conduct must be replicative of the society’s morality; for it is her frail shoulders that the entire society’s morality rests upon. In addition, she must perfect at managing the house while keeping her demeanor overtly shy and decent. Dupatta clad? That calls for bonus points. If all the requirements are spot on, her parents have done a fine job raising her.

On the contrary, a woman who prioritizes her career over family is clearly an abomination. In fact, she is the root of all evil. And if she stays out late at night, God forbid, she could be the reason for the onset of a formidable calamity. These are some of the basic standards that we require our women to live up to. Speaking of bare minimum traits required in a woman, one cannot help but fathom the dress code requirement. She must dress to protect her modesty. Her apparel must not tamper with the minds of innocent men or in such case, must certainly not jeopardize their modesty. A woman who dresses in “provocative” ways indeed “invites” trouble; for the lewd stares were an innocent response to the indecent apparel adorned by these women. In fact, it is precisely what derailed these pious men from the path of righteousness. Hence, the ogling is a natural response and given the circumstances, it is only normal for a man to act in such a way. After all, boys will be boys, no?

Even the minority that does believe in giving due respect to a woman, does so in light of the reasoning that that particular woman is someone else’s sister or wife or daughter. I have been unable to wrap my head around this idea. Are we only meant to respect a woman because she is somehow related to a man? Or because we ourselves would not want any other man to disrespect any woman that we personally know? We must understand that a woman is entitled to respect, not because of her sex, but simply because she is a human. It is her most innate and primal right to get that respect. Her relationship to her husband, father or brother is not reason enough to earn her that respect. Instead, it is her biological make up: she is human and so, worthy of such dignity.

Our society is steeped in a patriarchal system, so much so, that a man’s masculinity can only be warranted if he can exercise control over his woman. Not only is a woman’s subjugation necessary for the society to function, but it must also be made clear that these females are the keeper’s of the society’s honor. In so doing, we not only crush the woman’s dignity but also take away from her, her aspirations, and her dreams. I’m not just referring to aims such as higher education or equal job opportunities, but also an average woman’s everyday freedom. We have excluded them from public spaces; never have I ever seen a woman sitting carelessly under the comfort of a tree in a public place without the presence of her male guardian. Ideas such as women playing street cricket are alien to this society because such ideas are clearly associated only with boys while examples of such marginalization abound.

In short, our society is cursed with some of the worst forms of gender discrimination. While our society so conveniently resides within the illusion of female subjugation, it ascribes ridiculous notions of honor to women. What then results from this is the flustered inflated ego of benighted men that is fed with bouts of misogyny and notions of submission of “weaker sex”. This society clearly requires a strenuous upheaval of these despicable beliefs that have for so long tainted it of patriarchy; striving towards a pro-humane society where cases like that of Aniqa Khalid’s become unheard of.",['Ali Afzal Sahi'],"The Pakistani society is plagued with instances of domestic violence: forceful marriages of underage girls, rape cases, and a list of such crimes that is apparently a never-ending one.

A German court Tuesday handed down lengthy jail sentences to a couple for repeatedly sexually abusing their young son and selling him to pedophiles online for more than two years.

In a case that shocked the country and raised serious questions about child protection services in Germany, the regional court in Freiburg sentenced the boy's mother, Berrin Taha, to 12-and-a-half years in prison.

Her husband Christian Lais, the boy's stepfather whom he called ""papa"", received a 12-year sentence followed by preventive detention.

Lais, 39, had a previous conviction for child abuse, raising questions why he was allowed to live in a home with a child present.

The court found that the unemployed couple had sexually assaulted the boy, now 10, and pimped him on the so-called darknet between May 2015 and August 2017.

They were convicted of rape, aggravated sexual assault of children, forced prostitution and distribution of child pornography, judge Stefan Buergelin said as he read out the verdict.

The couple was also ordered to pay a total of 42,500 euros ($49,200) in damages to the boy and another victim, a girl.

Their sentences fell short of what prosecutors had demanded 14 years and six months for Taha and 13 years and six months for Lais.

On Monday, the same court sentenced a Spanish pedophile, Javier Gonzalez Diaz, to 10 years' prison for repeatedly sexually abusing the young boy after paying the parents.

The 33-year-old was also ordered to pay 18,000 euros to the young victim.

The case came to light following an anonymous tip-off last September and led to the arrest of eight people who have been charged with belonging to an online pedophile ring.

Lais admitted on the witness stand to the assaults on the boy.

He also made serious accusations against the child's 48-year-old mother, who confessed to the crimes but remained largely silent about any possible motive during the trial.

In his verdict, Buergelin said Taha went along with the abuse at first so she would not lose Lais as a partner and later ""for financial motives"".

They charged several thousand euros (dollars) for each instance of abuse, filmed the acts and posted them on the darknet.

A gunman was also killed by police during the late night operation.

Heavily-armed police took part in the operation launched in the densely-populated locality late Wednesday night. The father of the victim burst into tears as he found his son “safe’ following the shootout.

Operation head Syed Ali told reporters that the boy, identified as Abu Bakar, was recovered safely and handed over to his parents soon after the raid.

“The abductor posing himself as a postman rang the doorbell of a house in Ghulshan-e-Ravi at about 7:30pm on Wednesday. As the boy opened the door of his house, he was blindfolded and taken away,” said Iqbal Town Superintendent Syed Ali.

The kidnapper later demanded Rs1 million ransom from the family of boy, he said, adding that a team planned the operation at about 02:00am on Thursday after taking into confidence the parents of the victim.

“The kidnappers entered the same house where (a) police raiding team was waiting for them. As some officials entered the house, kidnapper opened fire on police party. One kidnapper killed in cross firing while two others escaped,” the officer explained. The gunman was later identified as Tassadaq, a 26-year-old resident of Okara district, Syed Ali said. The police handed over the child to his family soon after the operation. “Abu Bakar’s parents thanked Lahore Police for recovering the child unharmed,” he added.

Another police official who took part in the operation said it was a complicated raid since the life of the boy was at risk. “When we did it successfully, we were so satisfied,” he said. According to him, father of the boy burst into tears as he witnessed the boy “safe and sound” in the police custody. Hafiz Shahzad, the victim’s father, also hugged the policemen who took part in the operation and thanked the officers for recovering the child within a few hours.

In a press statement on Thursday, Lahore capital city police officer Bashir Ahmad Nasir and DIG Shahzad Akbar appreciated the police team for recovering the child safely.

The latest figures suggest the horrific crime is on the rise particularly in the big cities despite police crackdowns on the most wanted criminals.

According to the latest police data, at least 35 cases of kidnapping for ransom have been reported by the provincial police during the first eight months of this year. Over a dozen such cases are still under investigation. Most of the victims were children belonging to middle-class. During the same period last year, the police had reported 27 incidents of abduction for ransom.

Meanwhile, the police shifted the body to the morgue for autopsy and raids were underway to arrest the accomplices of the key suspect.",['Ashraf Javed'],"LAHORE - The city police on Thursday rescued an eleven-year-old boy in a dramatic raid at a house in Lahore’s Gulshan-e-Ravi.

The girl sexually assaulted by the three sons of a PMLN MNA and five other suspects in Faisalabad has decided to drop the case. The victim changed her original statement on Friday from being raped, to exchanging ‘harsh words’ with the accused. The sudden retraction blatantly points to manipulation on part of the sons of Mian Farooq; Muazzam, Saad and Qasim Farooq got to her before justice could run its course. The police have dropped investigations after refusal on part of the victim to give her blood sample and sanction DNA tests.

The accused and their father, MNA Mian Farooq, have said that this was an attempt to malign their reputation. Vehemently denying the accusations and calling the victim a liar is beyond abominable, but not unexpected. The victim’s decision to retract the FIR does not prove their innocence. When it comes to blackmail, the person being blackmailed is the one that strives to divert public attention away from the entire episode. Common sense dictates that the girl is the one who is being blackmailed, while it is in the interest of Mian Farooq and his sons to keep this under wraps.

Are we really going to look the other way? Pretend that it never happened? Pretend that the medical examination of the victim did not confirm that she was gang-raped and tortured? The sons of PMLN’s Mian Farooq were identified, and now that she’s mysteriously retracted her statement, are we really not considering that she might have been forced to do so? Blackmailed, threatened or paid-off to stay quiet and let her attackers walk free, to repeat their crimes with impunity. Anyone with influence can do whatever they want to those who lack it.

The subjugation of women is also allowed to propagate itself after incidents such as this. Rape victims never receive justice, and a major reason is for this is the way their cases are dismissed in police departments all over the country. Never mind whether those accused are ever punished, the fact that most cases do not even make it to court is just as big a problem as the trials themselves. Fear of making things worse holds more than half the victims back from ever seeking justice. With regards to sexual assault, the government fails on all counts; first, in its inability to prevent such incidents from taking place. Secondly, from making the victims feel like they are the ones at fault, and lastly, allowing those that speak up to be blackmailed and denied justice, to make them feel like they have no hope for their attackers to be punished.",[],"The sudden retraction blatantly points to manipulation on part of the sons of Mian Farooq; Muazzam, Saad and Qasim Farooq got to her before justice could run its course.

ISLAMABAD: Police, on Monday, reported that three people, including a woman and her daughter, were murdered in a case of honour killing in a rural area of the federal capital.

The three were found murdered in a house at Madina Colony in Sangjani. The victims were bore torture marks all over their bodies.

The whereabouts of the woman’s husband and eight other children are unknown.

The bodies were found when the owner of the house observed blood spilling into the drains from inside. The owner, who lived in a nearby house, called the police who reached the spot and broke into the house.

According to the police, the body of the woman was found in the veranda while the bodies of two other women were found on the floor of the room. The dead bodies had multiple stab wounds all over them, including the abdomen, neck, face and arms.

Their faces had been smashed with stones by the killer(s).

The incident happened in Buner in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The police contacted their relatives after which the father and brother of Saeedullah reached the capital.

The relatives identified the body of Saeedullah but could not confirm who the two women were.

“We do not know their names but they look like our distant relatives,” they told the police.

According to the neighbours, Miraj Bibi, her husband and their nine children had rented the house on August 1. The police said Saeedullah used to visit the house occasionally and called the couple his uncle and aunt.

The police said the woman’s husband his other eight children along with a vehicle were missing from the house. “Their whereabouts are not known,” they added.

Lahore - Pakistan ended 2013 with a population of 182,589,000 people, which represents an increase of 3,428,889 people compared to 2012. The male population is about 92,019,313 representing 50.39pc of the total and Female population is 87,140,798 or 47.72pc women.

According to latest census which took place in 2009, 4pc of females are literate whereas 69pc of males are literate. Total 57pc of Pakistani population is literate. A survey of psychiatric outpatients at a private clinic in Karachi found that two thirds of the patients were females and 60pc of these females had a mood disorder. 70pc of them were victims of violence (domestic violence, assault) and 80pc had marital or family conflicts.

In Pakistan, there are cultural institutions, beliefs and practices that undermine women’s autonomy and contribute to gender-based violence. Marriage practices can disadvantage women, especially when customs such as dowry and bride’s price, Watta Satta and marriage to the Quran (a custom in Sindh where girls remain unmarried like nuns to retain family property in the family) exist. In recent years dowry has become the part of marriage. This increasing demand for dowry, both before and after marriage, can escalate into harassment, physical violence and emotional abuse. In extreme cases homicide or “stove-burns” and suicides can provide husbands an opportunity to pursue another marriage and consequently more dowry. Women constantly cite reasons to remain in abusive relationship: fear of retribution, lack of other means of economic support, concern for the children, emotional dependence, lack of support from family and friends and the abiding hope that the husband may change one day. In Pakistan divorce continues to be a taboo and the fear of social stigma prevents women from reaching out for help. About 70pc of abused women have never told anyone.

Honor killing is another form of familial violence against women in Pakistan.

Studies have found that unemployment increases the risk of depression, aggressiveness and violent behaviours which in turn can result in an increased risk of physical, and emotional abuse. As unemployment is one of the big problems in the country, it is one of the important determinants of the violence against women. Young girls see their mothers going through the same treatment and unknowingly adapt to the system.

MULTAN - Fourteen members of a jirga have been arrested for ordering the rape of a teenage girl as punishment for a rape committed by her brother in a Multan village, police said Wednesday.

The heinous crime was committed last week in Rajapur village near Muzaffarabad town.

“A jirga (village council) had ordered the rape of a 16-year-old girl as punishment, as her cousin had raped a 12-year-old girl from the same village,” said Allah Baksh, a local police official.

He said the village council was approached by one Ashfaq, who complained that his 12-year-old sister, Shamim, had been raped by their relative, Umar.

The jirga/panchayat comprising Ameen, Saeed Patwari and others then handed over a cousin of Umer, named Azra, to complainant Ashfaq and ordered him to rape Azra in return. The panchayat order was duly carried out, police said.

Sources claimed that both the families had initially agreed on the panchayat verdict, but later they both approached a Women Centre and got registered cases against each other.

The allegations of revenge-rape were confirmed by Rashid Taheem, the police officer heading the investigation.

“Both the parties had filed cases of rape against each other at the local police station after the incident that happened last week,” he said.

“We have arrested 14 people of the village council so far,” he said, adding that the “main accused”, Ashfaq, who raped the 12-year-old was still at large.

SHO Muzaffarabad registered a case against all the accused involved after media highlighted the heinous act.

Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif also took notice of the incident and sought report from police.

City Police Officer Ahsan Younus told media that efforts were being made to catch Ashfaq. He said that the neither of the families had filed any report with the police, they instead went to the panchayat for a settlement.

However, as soon as police came to know about the incident, a quick action was taken to arrest the persons involved in this incident, he claimed.

Some residents of the area also claimed that Umar and Azra liked each other and wanted to marry. But Azra’s family refused to give her hand and accused Umar of raping the girl which led to horrific panchayat order.

Jirgas or panchayats formed of local elders are a traditional means of settling disputes in Pakistan’s rural areas, where courts and lawyers are not always accessible or trusted.

But such councils are illegal and have been under fire for their controversial decisions, especially regarding women.

A jirga was involved in one of South Asia’s most infamous cases of sexual violence against women when, in 2002, it ordered the gang rape of a woman called Mukhtar Mai after her brother was falsely accused of rape.

Mai made the unusual decision to defy her rapists and take them to court. Her attackers walked free but she went on to become a high-profile women rights activist.

Women and minorities in Pakistan are not safe. This is the truth of the day, no matter if hyper-nationalists and religious fanatics accept it or not. We regularly hear about honor killings and persecution of religious minorities in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. These cases, as a matter of fact, of violence and mass-killing are increasing day by day. There are, however, some laws in Pakistan to protect its citizens from both internal threats and external aggression. But despite all the laws, a considerable part of our society is not safe – it does not feel protected.

The question is: why is violence against women increasing in Pakistan despite the strict legislation? Why has the state failed to protect minorities? What legal and political steps should be taken by the state to protect her citizens irrespective of gender, and religious differences?

Let’s examine the case of religious minorities in the country. Ahmadis and Hindus are facing violent opposition and being humiliated for nothing. Their only crime, may be, is being Ahmadis or Hindus. Recently we have witnessed the destruction of Ahmadis’ place of worship when a violent mob attacked the community. On the other hand, forced conversion of Hindus is no more a hidden thing. The question arises what is the relevance or significance of Article 20 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which clearly says:

“Freedom to profess religion and to manage religious institutions. — Subject to law, public order and morality- (a) every citizen shall have the right to profess, practice and propagate his religion; and (b) every religious denomination and every sect thereof shall have the right to establish, maintain and manage its religious institutions.”

I shall come to this question in a while. But here it is pertinent to include one more important and very relevant case that is of honor killing. The Constitution of Pakistan assures the equality before law and takes men and women as citizens. It says:

“Equality of citizens. — (25-A) All citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law. (2) There shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex. (3) Nothing in this Article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the protection of women and children. ” President Alvi bans procession on Youm-e-Ali (R.A) amid COVID-19

But despite these laws, women and minorities in Pakistan feel as though they are second class citizens with no or few rights.

Although there is a ‘Blasphemy law’ in Pakistan, which assures that if anyone passes derogatory remarks against the Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H), and is found guilty, will be convicted, yet we see the brutal murder of a governor of the biggest province of Pakistan. The saddest part of the story was that the governor himself was a Muslim. He clarified his position many times, but the ‘believers’ didn’t bother to pay heed to what he was saying repeatedly.

Another victim of societal pressure and stereotyping was social media star and model Qandeel Baloch who was strangled to death by her brother. The brother killed her to save his family’s honor. The unfortunate Qandeel was challenging the traditional belief system of our society and exposing so many ugly faces.

There are laws, as we see, but people break them so frequently and even without the fear of being convicted and severely punished. Why does it happen anyway?

For this we need to understand the basic thing. Why laws are made.

Laws are made to protect the citizens of the state from all sort of internal as well as external threats and violence. But it needs to be understood that the law itself is not to determine the societal goals of any society, rather it only supplements the social process to achieve the socially determined goals. When laws contradict, known human history confirms, with local norms they are almost always ridiculously broken.

In case of Pakistan, the sense of male-domination and socially exclusive thinking are instilled in the mind of individuals through education at schools and colleges. For instance, the man who ruthlessly murdered ‘unruly’ Hindu is presented to our children as our hero and Hindus, in general, are portrayed as coward and hypocrites. This sort of educational curriculum is designed to foster official narrative in the minds of young students.

Individuals, who grow up in such a divisive society, find the laws which contradict what they are taught in early childhood.

Unfortunately, there is a contradiction between the social goals and the legal system prevailing in this country. Laws are made without carefully reading the public opinion, which sadly results into chaos and turmoil. Bertrand Russell in his book Power has rightly remarked that when the law is not supported by public opinion it is almost powerless.

This is the reason that despite the presence of laws, women and minorities in Pakistan are not treated equally. There is an attitudinal and cultural problem, which has been chiefly advocated to fulfil the narrow political interests of the ruling elites or of some powerful institutions. Law can play a role in minimizing the violence against all the victims at the moment, but for a long term and permanent solution, our state needs to review its policies and in particular its education policy.

There is a dire need of a formatting an education policy which professes inclusivity and the idea of coexistence. This change in education system with the aid of media propagation would definitely help the state change the societal goals and thus to make laws which would hardly be challenged or broken.

A change can only be brought through education without shedding blood. Without understanding the role and scope of law, the state can make so many other laws but nobody can protect Salman Taseer, Qandeel Baloch or Ahmadis and Hindus.

Our women and minorities can be better protected if the state decides to focus on modifying the social goals rather than only on laws.",['Farah Adeed'],"We regularly hear about honor killings and persecution of religious minorities in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

Judge Yogesh Khanna said the men, who could now face the death penalty, were guilty of murdering a ""helpless victim"" last December as he announced that arguments for sentencing of the four would be held on Wednesday.

""I convict all of the accused,"" Khanna said. ""They have been found guilty of gang rape, unnatural offences, destruction of evidence... and for committing the murder of the helpless victim.""

The four - Mukesh Singh, Akshay Thakur, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma - had all pleaded not guilty to the charges, which included murder, gang rape and theft.

The men, all of whose faces were revealed for the first time on Tuesday, were economic migrants living in or around a south Delhi slum who were drawn to the city to escape grinding rural poverty.

The victim's parents, who wept in court as the verdict was announced, have led the calls for them to be hanged, saying that they would only find closure if the four are executed.

Their 23-year-old daughter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, died of her injuries on December 29 in a Singapore hospital after being lured on to the private bus following a cinema trip with a male friend.

After beating up the friend, the gang brutally assaulted her on the moving bus behind tinted windows for 45 minutes before flinging the bloodied and barely conscious couple from the vehicle on a road leading to the international airport.

Amid emotional and unruly scenes outside the courtroom as journalists jostled each other for space, lawyers for three of the convicts said they would appeal the verdict while the fourth was considering his options. ""My client was simply driving the bus. He confessed fairly that he was driving the bus but he did not know what went on inside,"" V.K. Anand, the lawyer for Mukesh Singh, told reporters. ""We will appeal this verdict in the High Court in a month's time. But we will see what happens tomorrow after arguments and the quantum of punishment.""

It was not clear when the four would be sentenced. A.P. Singh, the lawyer for Akshay Thakur and Vinay Sharma, called the verdict a ""political conviction"" and said they would appeal.

Mukesh Singh's mother, draped in a beige saree, fell to Anand's feet and broke down in tears outside the courtroom. The lawyer and her husband both tried to pick her up. Any subsequent appeal by the defendants is likely to take years in India's notoriously slow legal system.

A juvenile has already been sentenced to three years in a correctional facility, while a fifth adult defendant, bus driver Ram Singh, was found hanging in his prison cell in March while awaiting trial.

""We will not accept anything below the death penalty,"" the victim's father told AFP from his home in southwestern Delhi in an interview last week.

""If all four are sentenced to death, I can't imagine anything being better than that... We will get closure.""

The seven-month trial has been held in a special fast-track court in south Delhi, with more than 100 witnesses called to give evidence, including 85 for the prosecution.

Despite an initial gagging order on the trial, the case has drawn huge interest and about 20 TV trucks were outside the court on Tuesday morning while dozens of journalists fought to get inside.

The attack sparked weeks of sometimes violent street protests across India with seething public anger about sex crimes against women.

It also led to tougher laws for sex offenders, including the death penalty for rapists whose victims die or are left in a vegetative state.

But savage attacks against women are still reported daily in India's newspapers and the gang rape of a photographer last month near an upmarket area of Mumbai rekindled public disgust.

During the trial, the prosecution produced DNA evidence, the victim's dying testimony and statements from the male companion.

In an interview ahead of the verdict, the 28-year-old companion told AFP that the assault was beyond a nightmare.

""I never imagined that one human being could treat another so badly,"" he said.

A small group of protesters stood outside the court as part of a campaign to push for the death penalty. Some wore makeshift nooses, while one held a sign that read ""We Want Rape-Free India"".

India has the death sentence for the ""rarest of rare crimes"", but does not often carry out executions.

The student's family were bitterly disappointed with the three-year sentence handed down last month to the youngest defendant, the maximum allowed by law as he was only 17 at the time of the attack.",[],"NEW DELHI - An Indian court convicted four men Tuesday of the gang rape and murder of a student on a New Delhi bus in a crime that sickened the nation and led to new laws to tackle endemic sex crime.
""They have been found guilty of gang rape, unnatural offences, destruction of evidence... and for committing the murder of the helpless victim.""

https://nation.com.pk/24-Mar-2016/growth-in-child-abuse,2016-03-23 23:04:09+05:00,Growth In Child Abuse,"Share:

On Tuesday an NGO, Sahil, published a report called ‘Cruel Numbers 2015” that analyses incidents of child abuse by using information gleaned from newspapers. The damning report reveals that altogether 3,768 children - 1,974 girls and 1,794 boys - were reportedly abused across the country during 2015. That showed a 7% rise in the crime over 2014 and the sordid statistic of 10 children abused every day during 2015. Even more shocking than this number is fact that the 167 child abuse cases reported in Islamabad in 2015 surpassed the 113 cases reported from the entire Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province – an 85% increase from last year. Once we take into consideration that the vast majority of child abuse goes unreported we can see how ominous this problem truly is.

Unfortunately, combating child, and sexual abuse ranks low on the government’s priority list. The idea that sexual crimes are prevalent in India has taken the global populations fancy, and each crime there is extensively highlighted. Pakistan – which has similar cultural and rural development demographics – has a similar problem, as the numbers suggest, but the government’s response is decidedly different. Cases of rape and sexual assault are rarely allowed to be media headlines, and those that become ones are swiftly dismissed as an isolated incident. It was not long ago that the country was shocked by the incidents of child pornography and mass sexual assault in Kasur – an incident that was unprecedented in terms of scale and maliciousness. Yet, what should have led to a country wide and public inquest was instead undermined, undersold, and eventually shunned from the public’s eye. Whatever became of the Joint Investigation Commission? Today the accused maybe awaiting trial, but the wider problem of almost institutional child abuse has gone uninvestigated.

The government still refuses to deal with sexual problems head on – after all it is one that banned a condom ad for implying that using a condom might be pleasurable too as well as controlling unwanted birth. It still tiptoes around rape and assault and hopes that what happens behind closed doors should stay behind them. This attitude has changed somewhat, with the state inserting itself into the home through the women’s protection bill. It must undertake a similar initiative to bring cases of sexual assault and child abuse under control.",[],"Share:On Tuesday an NGO, Sahil, published a report called ‘Cruel Numbers 2015” that analyses incidents of child abuse by using information gleaned from newspapers.

https://nation.com.pk/02-May-2019/a-bill-to-look-out-for,2019-05-01 22:51:48+05:00,A Bill To Look Out For,"Share:

Not for the first time, a heated debate broke out on the floor of the national assembly upon introduction of a bill to set a minimum age of marriage.

The primary opponents of the bill were Religious Affairs Minister Noorul Haq Qadri and Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Mohammad Khan, who strongly voiced their reservations with the bill. Ali Mohammad Khan felt himself qualified enough to term the bill as ‘un-Islamic’, stating that he would resign his minister-ship if an un-Islamic bill was passed.

It appears that the esteemed Minister deems the laws of Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Bangladesh and Turkey, Islamic countries which have been our allies and who Prime Minister Imran Khan has stated he looks up to, un-Islamic as well, since there are similar restrictions on the age of marriage. To make such statements is to ignore in bad faith the pervasive problem of child brides and forced marriages that have existed in the subcontinent for hundreds of years, and are still prevalent today. To pretend that the matter is merely a religious one, and doesn’t constitute an extremely harmful social ill is to ignore the exploitation that occurs of young girls who are married off to strangers much older than them to pay off their parents’ debts, of spousal abuse, sexual violence and economic dependence that is common in early marriages due to the vulnerability of child brides and of the severe reproductive problems that teenage mothers face. Early marriage is not a tenant of Islam and for the Minister to term the bill a religious one and propose to grant the jurisdiction to the Council of Islamic Ideology, when the CII has already shown bias towards it, is in bad faith.

What is the most revealing part of this saga are the divisions within parties that exposed themselves during the debate of this bill. PTI’s Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari was a strong proponent of this bill, yet her biggest opponent was her own party’s Minister. Similarly, most of the men of PML-N opposed the bill, while female legislators stood in support of it. It was only the PPP which unanimously supported the bill, for which we must give PPP due credit for its unwavering progressive ideals. We urge everyone to keep an eye out on how legislators reacted to this bill- it is an important indicator on who is truly progressive, and who still votes for under-age marriage.",[],"The primary opponents of the bill were Religious Affairs Minister Noorul Haq Qadri and Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Mohammad Khan, who strongly voiced their reservations with the bill.

Forced marriages are not a new issue in Pakistan, which in recent years have been highlighted on social and electronic media and press. Rida Shah is an aspiring photographer from Islamabad, who has captured the ordeal, one has to under go while getting married against one's wish, through her lens.

Rida has a versatile portfolio ranging from random photography to theme based layout, and shoots for clothing lines.

Since civil society has now started to raise their voices to create awareness about ‘forced marriages,' a number of people have come out to take a stand against it in their own way, and Rida Shah uses the power of her lens to highlight the issue of “forced marriages.”

In a recent spread on the Social Media site Instagram, she has shown how 21pc underage girls are being forced into marriage as given on the site 'Girls not Brides'. The theme shows how a woman cannot speak her mind or give her opinion in such a scenario.

In one picture the model is shown with her feet tied with a rope depicting her forceful tying in a matrimonial relationship. The background of the spread have slogans in Urdu saying, Larki jawan hogai (the girl has matured), Larki to parai hai (parents’ home is a temporary abode for girls).

One of the picture shows the girl wearing a red wedding dress with braids and laces, but in chains standing like a puppet.

Another picture shows her hand forcefully held by a relative while the groom puts on a ring by on her finger.

A picture that really moves the viewer shows blood trickling down the brides’ eye instead of the tears of a shy bride!

Rida Shah says that these 'un-Islamic' practices are being practiced openly in an Islamic society.

“In this so called Islamic society of ours, it is surprising how so many false and unfair practices are followed even by our most educated families. One of those is forcing your child to marry someone absolutely without their consent. 'Abhe nae pasnd tou kia hua, aik bar nikkah krdo sb theek hojaega;' (if you don’t like him now get married it will be alright later).

'Bacha hai tou kia hua, prhae likhae shadi k bad krlega'” (what if she is a kid, she can complete her studies after marriage).

Rida said that she respects parents' right to find a life partner for their children but Islam does not give them the right to force their decision on their children.

“I completely respect the fact that parents have the right to 'suggest' to their children who they should marry or not, but Islam does not give them the right to take this decision all by themselves, especially when their child is not willing to.”

Stats given in the post too show that an estimated 21% girls in Pakistan are forcefully married before the age of 18.

She went on to say that such marriages do not last long and the children blame their parents forever. She also believes that not only women are forced to marry but men also have to face such aggression in the family; however females have to bear this trauma more than males.

“These marriages either end up in divorces or children blaming their parents all their life.”

Speaking to The Nation, Rida Shah said, “I know a couple of people who have gone through this ordeal and how messed their life became after it. Parents need to realise that they are doing no good to their children by forcing them into marriage with someone they don’t want to marry.”

To a question as to why her model’s face is covered she said, “The face of the person is not important but the cause is. This is an issue which men and women face. My point was to highlight the issue and raise awareness about it.”

When asked if this project was supported by someone she said, “I have done this shoot all myself and used different places in my surroundings.”

In conclusion she said, “I know this practice will not end overnight, but I hope to have educated people about it so they can understand the importance of the issue and take a stand against it.”",['R Umaima Ahmed'],"Share:Forced marriages are not a new issue in Pakistan, which in recent years have been highlighted on social and electronic media and press.

Harvey Weinstein's accusers were finally heard because the US producer's power was ""on the wane,"" US-British actress Rachel Weisz told the Evening Standard in an interview published Thursday.

More than 100 women have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment, sexual assault or rape over a 20-year period, since the publication of an article in the New York Times in October.

Weisz, 47, is a friend of British actress Sophie Dix, who has accused the producer of assaulting her in a hotel room when she was 22 years old.

""My friend Sophie Dix has been talking about this since the 1990s,"" Weisz told the London newspaper.

""She would tell anyone who would listen her story, for the last 20 years. And no one seemed to care.

""I think his power was on the wane, the same with Bill O'Reilly, same with Charlie Rose (US news anchors).

""It's about economics -— they weren't turning over the big bucks any more,"" she added.

However, she was optimistic that the scandal could still lead to real-world improvements.

""Let's hope there's some real structural change to come out of this.

WASHINGTON - The US city of Cleveland has reached a $6 million settlement with the family of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old African American fatally shot by police while holding a toy gun.

Under the terms of the settlement, Cleveland does not admit any wrongdoing, according to details of the accord announced Monday by a US District Court in Ohio.

The deal, which still requires the approval of a probate court, shields the city from a potential federal civil rights trial that would have drawn renewed scrutiny of its troubled police force. Rice's November 2014 death at the hands of a white officer was one of a series of high-profile incidents involving police violence against African Americans that fueled protests across the country.

Several of these cases have resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements between cities and the families of victims.

Women’s rights are an essential part of universal human rights. They form a central principle of the United Nations, which is celebrating its 70th anniversary this year. And yet, the fact remains that women and girls around the world often face gender-based discrimination that puts them at increased risk of a poor education, poverty, ill health and violence.

Here in Pakistan, two-thirds of the country’s 60 million women of working age - the size of the entire UK population - can’t read or write, 12,000 women die every year in childbirth and more than nine million girls do not go to school. Pakistan is missing out on the talent and productivity of half of its population. A recent survey revealed Pakistan is the third most dangerous country in the world for women due to the prevalence of honour killings, forced marriage, rape, and other violence. Lack of economic opportunities, difficulty in accessing education and health facilities and under-representation in politics and decision-making have all contributed to Pakistan’s position of 135 out of 136 countries on the World Economic Forum’s Gender Gap Index.

That’s the bad news. The good news is that Pakistan recognises the problem and is working hard, often with the help of international donors like my Government, to address it.

During my first six months in Pakistan I have seen that Pakistan recognises the challenge ahead and has shown a strong commitment to deliver improvements. Pakistan has introduced important legislation at both the federal and provincial level to help protect women and strengthen their rights. A number of important bills have been approved over recent years including the bills for prevention of sexual harassment in the workplace, acid crimes and domestic violence. The British Government welcomes these important first steps which are complemented by existing UK work to allow girls and women to have the opportunity to achieve their potential free from discrimination and violence. But many challenges and obstacles of course remain.

On International Women’s Day, which we celebrate today, we celebrate the progress made since the occasion was first marked in 1911. But today also represents an opportunity for females around the world, including the 90 million women and girls here in Pakistan, to call for greater equality. This year’s theme for International Women’s Day is “Make it Happen”. An important step in bringing about equal rights and equal opportunities for men and women is to secure the support and buy-in from men. Men and women need to work together to make change happen. This isn’t just the right thing to do. It makes economic sense.

Evidence suggests that countries where women are equal to men have stronger growth and are more productive and prosperous. This means girls and women must have equal access to education and economic opportunities. Only when men and women participate equally can Pakistan’s economy thrive.

Research from the World Bank suggests that almost half of women’s productive potential globally is under utilised, compared to just a fifth of men’s. Inclusive economic growth therefore, is a key ingredient, not only to unlock the potential of women and girls but nations as a whole. This means creating an environment that can enable women to access and seize opportunities to lift themselves and their families out of poverty. Women invest nearly all the money they earn back into their family to educate and feed their children. That is why women and girls are at the heart of the UK Government’s development work.

Last week, the British High Commission supported the UN Women’s Pakistan launch of their global Campaign for Gender Equality. The ‘He for She’ campaign is a solidarity movement that invites men to be advocates for gender equality. Men around the world are generally considered ‘members of the dominant group,’ because they have access to social and institutional power which women usually lack. Gender equality cannot be achieved if only one gender is involved. It is essential that men are part of the debate. Last Thursday, the Chevening Alumni Association of Pakistan, supported by members of Pakistan’s Women’s Parliamentary Caucus and the British High Commission, also debated the importance of men and boys supporting women and girls as agents of change in their inaugural lecture.

The UK and Pakistan are joined by our extensive cultural and people to people links. We are committed to supporting Pakistan’s socio-economic development, including working for gender equality and women’s empowerment. Progress has certainly been made in recent years. The UK is pleased to be working in partnership with Pakistan to reduce poverty further, including by improving access to health and education services and boosting economic growth.

If women are healthy, educated and free from violence, they will flourish. If women have a chance to work and earn as full and equal partners in society, their families will flourish. And when families flourish, communities and nations do as well. The British High Commission continues to support Pakistan in its efforts to deliver even more progress in this important area.

An eight-year-old boy was shot and killed in police crossfire in northern India, an officer said yesterday.

Madhav Bharadwaj was playing with friends in Uttar Pradesh state when he was shot dead in front of his grandfather late on Wednesday.

Police said they went into the boy's village on a tip-off that suspected robbers were hiding out there, and it was unclear who fired the bullet that struck him.

Villagers, however, told local media that only police were shooting.

""Three policemen came to the village and asked the (suspects) to gather at the terrace of a nearby temple for a talk. But suddenly the cops began firing,"" the boy's grandfather told the Times of India newspaper.

""My poor grandson was playing nearby and got hit. I froze for a moment. I was unable to understand what had happened.""

Rajesh Kumar Sonker, a superintendent of police in Mathura district where the incident took place, told AFP an investigation was underway.

""We are probing the case and will soon get to know how the child got hit and killed,"" he said.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath offered his condolences to the family and compensation of 500,000 rupees (S$10,365).

The state has one of the highest crime rates in India, an issue that Adityanath pledged to tackle with tough policing when he was named chief minister last March.

Rights groups have however accused him of abusing his power after he reportedly said at a rally that criminals would ""either be sent to jail or killed in police encounters"".

Police in Uttar Pradesh and other Indian states have been accused of faking ""encounters"" with suspects to carry out extrajudicial killings.

""It has observed that even if the law and order situation is grave, the state cannot resort to such mechanism, which may result in the extrajudicial killings of the alleged criminals,"" India's National Human Rights Commission said in a statement responding to Adityanath's comments.

Feminism: A global advocacy of social and political equality for all human beings regardless of their gender, age, religion, race and nationality.

By now, we’ve all heard of the name ‘Bahar Mustafa’ – the “Diversity Officer” of a British university who infamously banned white people and men from attending a so-called “anti-racism” event. Mustafa defended her racist and sexist attitude by claiming she can be neither racist nor sexist because of her “ethnic minority” status.

To be clear, Mustafa used Feminism as a front to push her racist and sexist bile and later justified her abuse by erroneously defining racism and sexism to suit her convenience. For those post-modern Western feminists who have a hard time deciphering what “Racism” actually is – it’s not defined by personal financial, social and political authority – Racism is solely measured by contemptuous attitudes toward the skin colour and geography of persons and is perpetuated through racial hostility from the poorest to the wealthiest of citizens from across the globe.

When Mustafa’s belligerence was met with the backlash it very well deserved – she garnered support from other pseudo feminists who defended her blatant racism and sexism by regurgitating not only her “as an ethnic minority….” nonsense, but also cited “free speech”. Apparently, she’s a knight in shining armour who merely tried to create a “safe space” for blacks and ethnic minorities by using the hashtag “#KillAllWhiteMen” and racist slurs like “white trash”. This new breed of unicorns are flaunting their new-age racism and sexism as Feminism and feeding the anti-feminist and misogynistic trolls that fuel the invalidation of authentic Feminism.

Those who proudly support Mustafa reek with narcissism just like their dear leader – the stench of their abuse has proceeded across oceans and infected the eagerly awaiting unicorns hungry for the opportunism necessary to utilize their phantom victimhood to justify their own racist/sexist behaviours. Bahar Mustafa is an illustration of what fanning the flames of racism/sexism looks like – her attitude is not one which Feminism endorses – she is, however, a representation of opportunism – and I’m an ethnic minority woman, so you can’t hold it against me for being critical of her!

I don't “#supportbaharmustafa” because as an ethnic minority who survived genocide – I find her racism and sexism immeasurably nauseating. To associate my identity as an ethnic minority to justify the very societal abuse [which she promotes against whites/men] that rained bombs and bullets over my people will never be forgiven. Being an ethnic minority does not magically blockade the contempt that influences racism and sexism in people – we people of colour are not immune from attitudes resonating from cultural, religious and racial bigotry just because some white people happen to be racists in the West – to even entertain such logic is obtuse. In fact – people of colour in the East are profoundly more abusive against racial minorities than the Western world.

Opportunism arrives in many forms when selfish people feel like crying over their irrational hurt feelings – kind of like the outrage over the Game of Thrones episode. Western feminists rallied in honour of Sansa Stark unlike any victim of real life sexual violence! I was rather amused by the weeping and wailing and the oaths of never tuning into the show ever again – because while pseudo feminism outraged over a fictional character’s trauma, real-life women and girls were being raped in Nigeria by Boko Haram for many months now, and by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, among other real life events of gender-based violence like the shooting of Mutlu Kaya. And yet, not a single word of outrage trended for these victims. The freedom of expression is being systematically denied to women and girls worldwide but Western [pseudo] feminists couldn’t for one moment get a sense of priority and use their “free speech” to address these daily abuses.

Women like Malina Suliman from Afghanistan literally risk their lives to express their right to free speech and equality under the tyrannical rule of the religious extremists, the Taliban. Afghanistan is a place where women and girls are sentenced to jail or murdered for “moral crimes” such as refusing the hijab/burqa or being assertive with their fundamental human rights by rejecting obedience to their husband or relatives.

Can you fathom the 21st century, where freedom of expression is yet to be secured for females anywhere on earth? A woman/girl cannot express her real-life distress and abuse without being accused of “talking too much” or “dishonouring the family” or “being a bitch”. A girl cannot even attend school to express her intelligence because that too “offends” the mainstream Patriarchy that continues to dehumanize them. When the Taliban shot Malala Yousafzai who advocated for universal education for all children, including girls – not only was she accused of being a Zionist agent and American spy, among other delusional accusations – I had witnessed many Western feminists join the shaming by calling her “white washed” and “Islamophobic”.

Many of the domestic violence cases where men batter their girlfriend, wife or daughters, are rooted in the misogyny that denies Free Speech for females as well. If women/girls object or address their opinions in matters – suddenly Patriarchy gets spasms of triggers that outrage its ego and so the hand is raised to turn its victim black and blue. Mutlu Kaya was allegedly shot by none other than her own [ex] boyfriend because Kaya pursued singing against his wishes, as a contestant in a Turkish television show known as Sesi Cok Guzel. Entertainment is a forbidden industry, especially for women/girls as it is culturally and religiously frowned upon in the Muslim and a great majority of the Eastern world – a sentiment that is closely echoed by many male intimate partners. And for those thinking how this could be an isolated incident – there are plenty of women and girls who were murdered by an intimate partner and men who just couldn’t tolerate female independence. I had previously detailed my points on violence against women and girls.

The censorship of Free Speech for women and girls goes hand in hand with misogyny and sexism. One of the well noted and earliest examples from history that persecuted women for their freedom of expression is Hypatia, a well famed name in mathematics and astronomy. Alas, a woman who is evident of intellectual complexity was a threat to the patriarchal society and so she paid the ultimate price for expressing herself – her life. There are many theories regarding her murder – some say she was stoned to death, others say she endured enormous torture like mutilation and being flayed alive – but we’ll never know the absolute truth except that Hypatia was silenced for merely applying Free Speech to her daily life.

A woman in the Muslim world must fear even a visit to her own relatives’ house without the permission of her husband, like Shabana Bibi, who was murdered by her husband for precisely that reason. Imagine living a life where you cannot express that that life is your own…? Such scale of gender-apartheid denies fundamental human rights for all women/girls at one point or another.

Even in crisis, women/girls can’t express their right to life – like the case of the Rohingya. While both men and women are fleeing on boats, the men rape the women/girls who are also fleeing the same genocide. How does one process such horror without erupting in rage? People want justice for the Rohingya which is long overdue but who will give justice for the Rohingya women/girls raped by their own brethren…?

Women/girls are told they can only express their identity through the approval of Patriarchy. While genuine feminists vocally express the gender-based issues plaguing the world – anti-feminists threaten their lives and even promote violence to silence them. There is very little difference between the Islamists like the Kouachi brothers who attacked Charlie Hebdo and the men who batter their wives/girlfriends/daughters – as both groups of men assault people who practice their right to Free Speech.

So between Bahar Mustafa and team-Sansa Stark vs. the multiple examples of real life issues that women and girls require emancipation from – I give my support to the latter cause. As for those in solidarity to people like Mustafa and fictional characters – you have your right to express yourselves – I will fight to secure you that right. And if your expressions are ostentatious and vile – I will practice my right to Free Speech and call you out on your bulls**t because I have my priorities straight; Humanism will always trump tribalism.

One day, maybe centuries after I am long dead and turned to dust, women and girls will wear a hijab because it represents something other than the fetishization of female modesty and we'll have the right to free speech and expression without facing consequences from the glares of Patriarchy – maybe one day, religion will actually mean peace and will not endorse anti-LGBTQ sentiments, racism, sexism, violence and misogyny. But until that day – as a woman, as a daughter – as a human being – I have a fundamental duty to lambast Patriarchy – and those who adopt its values to enforce their own bigotry.",['Aki Muthali'],"Mustafa defended her racist and sexist attitude by claiming she can be neither racist nor sexist because of her “ethnic minority” status.

https://nation.com.pk/09-Jan-2019/honour-killing-in-pakistan,2019-01-08 23:13:27+05:00,Honour killing in Pakistan,"Share:

Honour killings are known locally as Karo-Kari. Pakistan has the highest volume of documented an estimated honour killing in Pakistan is performed greatly a rate of increment (1000 out of the 5000 total). Since the death of the victim is viewed as a way of restoring the reputation and honour of the family. It is likely that honour killing has been a practice in Pakistan for thousands of years and it remains a common practice in Pakistan today, unless the general public chooses to condemn the practice.

Honour killings are once again becoming a national controversy in Pakistan, the practice in which a family will murder one of its own members for social transgression such as having premarital sex, is receiving another round of international attention over the killing of a pregnant woman in Lahore. Even though, a 25 year old girl killed by her father for not accepting the relative to marry with.

Honour killings are neither mentioned, nor are they at all exclusive to the Islamic world and as an Islamic state Pakistan, where it is really common, but unfortunately the Islamic leaders in Pakistan are not taking any serious action against that. In 2004, law formally prohibits the practice, still, every year, according to rights groups that track the issue, but numerous hundred Pakistani families kill one another, even the child for bringing shame on the family since the victims are women. To take a case, from 2007, 13 years a Pakistani girl who was raped later on the society members or village elders pressures her family to murder her in an honour killing, but refused, instead asking the police to arrest her repists, fortunately her family’s legal battle for justice for her repists made her case a national symbol of the fight over honour killings.

Actually the reasons that honour killings continue, in Pakistan and elsewhere, are deeply complicated. The people in Pakistan get away with these kinds of executions of women because of weak law and the High Court System must reserve the harshest punishments for women exercising their free will. In 2013, however, Pew released the result of a multi-year, 39- country survey of countries with large or majority Muslim population, then a question was asked to the people who were present there at the time. In other words, whether honour killings are permissible and 45% percent of Pakistani respondents said it was and it is contained on. The local communities in which many or most citizens believe that honour killings are permissible or even just in which many or most people in Pakistan of power believe that, would seem naturally more included to tolerate or even encourage this practice while the popular attitudes are surely far from the only factor that explains the continuation of honour killings. They can play a significant role and the roots of that popular supports are themselves remarkably complex and a subject of life and continued debate among scholars.

Though, Pakistan’s problem with honour killings may receive significant international coverage, mix attitudes towards the practice are not unique to the country. Even the honour killings are never justified as sure that Pakistan is one of the world most populous countries with 180 million people even so a minority of honour killings supporters can do a lot of damage if they have local control but the attention of government is required towards such dangerous issues as the women are victims.

In other words, whether honour killings are permissible and 45% percent of Pakistani respondents said it was and it is contained on.","['islamic', 'honour', 'world', 'women', 'family', 'killing', 'pakistan', 'pakistani', 'practice', 'killings']","{'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/rsss.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/android_app_on_play_logo_small.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/g_plus.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/linkedin_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2019-01-08/ji-parts-ways-with-mma-1546971626-2138.jpg', 'https://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619912693.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png?date=2019-02-15', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/twitter.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_publishrr.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/utube.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/uploads/theme/logo-1550475639.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619902433.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/whatsapp_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/facebook.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/app-store.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png'}",True,https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg,1,,,,,nation

HAFIZABAD - Different social, political workers and businessmen of Hafizabad district have strongly protested against the slackness of Jalalpur Bhattian Police for its failure in arresting the accused involved in the abduction of two sons of Akhtar Ali, one of them was sodomised and murdered while the other has not yet been traced.

They expressed their resentment over the rising incidents of child abuse in Jalalpur Bhattian area and the police apathy to prevent such incidents.

On Tuesday evening Ali Hamza (14) and his elder brother Zaman Akhtar son of Akhtar Ali of Mohallah Iqbalpur Jalalpur Bhattian went to the Bazar to purchase something when they were abducted by some fiendish youngmen.

The parents went from pillar to post to locate them for several hours and found the dead body of Ali Hamza lying in the nearby field in naked condition on Wednesday. Following this, hundreds of villagers gathered and blocked Pindi Bhattian road and staged demonstration to protest against the police. Several political workers and traders condemned the behaviour of the SHO. Even PTI leaders including MNA Ch. Shoukat Ali Bhatti also addressed the protesters and demanded immediate suspension of the SHO and early recovery of the second son of Akhtar Ali (Zaman Akhtar). The DPO suspended the SHO immediately and constituted two special teams to arrest the accused and to trace Zaman Akhtar within 24 hours but the police had neither arrested any of the accused nor traced Zaman Akhtar.

According to official figures, eleven cases of child abuse were registered in Jalalpur Bhattian Police station during the past two-and-a-half month which was cause of concern of the inhabitants. They had demanded immediate arrest of the accused and locate Zaman Akhtar.

Meanwhile, city police had arrested a hair dresser Abdul Basit of Mohallah Bahawalpura on the charge of allegedly sodomising a ten year old boy Muhammad Abdullah of same locality.",['Our Staff Report'],"They expressed their resentment over the rising incidents of child abuse in Jalalpur Bhattian area and the police apathy to prevent such incidents.

https://nation.com.pk/15-Apr-2021/veiled-vulgarity,2021-04-14 22:25:25+05:00,Veiled vulgarity,"Share:

Recently there has been great outrage at our holier-than-thou Prime Minister’s statement where he insinuated how women dress has a correlation with increasing cases of rape and sexual violence in the country. He said, “In any society where vulgarity is prevalent, there are consequences.”

The Prime Minister also said women in Pakistan should remove “temptation” because “not everyone has willpower” and advised ‘purdah’—perhaps inspired by the first lady.

I equally respect women who observe purdah and those who don’t. It’s an individual’s choice and their own value system of what purdah or lack of means for them.

The biggest argument for what IK stated—and I wish someone had questioned the esteemed PM—is that if vulgarity invites sexual offence then how do you explain a 5-year-old child being raped by grown up men?

As a therapist, I would like to give my insight into the psychology of an offender/abuser. First of all, my dear PM, temptation has nothing to do with a man wanting to rape or sexually assault a woman. It is also not as simple as saying not indulging in a non-permissible sexual act is about willpower or lack thereof.

The abuse by an abuser is about what is inside him and not what is outside of him. It’s not like ‘she made me do it.’ It’s more like ‘I want to do it and I don’t care if it’s a woman in a so-called vulgar dress or a purdah clad woman.’

Raping or sexually abusing someone is about the perpetrator and never about the victim. A sexual assaulter can be any kind of a person and studies have shown that some of the personality traits include apathy, narcissism and feelings of hostility and aggression towards women. Remember that a sexual assault is not about sexual gratification or sexual interest, but more about dominating the other as one always has ethical and healthy options of gratifying the same needs.

One common cause in our culture can be the need of such young men to exert superiority over their male peers by flaunting that they are highly sexual beings. Such men would most likely be failures in life and can feed into their false male egos by considering themselves an alpha male by sexual acts. The excessive watching of porn is also a contributing factor and can increase sexual frustration.

In any culture, being a male and a virgin is a lot of pressure and would be stigmatised. Many of these men are almost in a panic and sense of emergency to join the bandwagon of other male adults. In most cases, religious boundaries would not matter. Many of these men also feel that this act gives them a sense of dominance, especially in a patriarchal society like Pakistan where the male child is made to feel superior since he comes into the world. If he is not living a healthy socially active life, he would go for anything that can give a sense of this fake masculinity.

In our culture the shame around sexuality, patriarchy and dominance are all sublimated through a kind of dehumanisation in which women are seen as inferior beings to men. This makes it much easier for women to become the targets of bellicosity.

There is also another kind of rapist that looks for any opportunity of gratification and loses self-control under the influence of substance. Another type is the heartless rapist whose stimulus is to humiliate and degrade his victims. He might even have an undiagnosed mental health condition like psychosis or sadistic tendencies that leads him to this heinous crime.

Then there is the vindictive rapist or offender who has anger and hostility focused directly on women, maybe due to personal history. Such sexual offenders believe they are allowed to sexually attack women because they feel they have been hurt, rejected or wronged by women in the past.

There is also intergenerational trauma history that leads to such personalities being formed, which means a son growing up in a household where the father constantly has physically abused the mother will most likely turn him into an adult that does the same towards other women.

Sexual assault is an unforgivable act of violence and a crime. Unfortunately, a lot of the victims remain silent to avoid stigmatisation and being blamed by society, while their rapists go free. It gets ingrained in the psyche of the victim that she is to be blamed for what happened due to judgment by society. And when the head of a state makes such an irresponsible comment, I can’t even imagine how many more victims of abuse will remain silent or never come forward. Dear PM, please make an educative and responsible statement next time on such a sensitive and painful issue. Invite an expert to give you a better understanding into the psyche of such crimes before blurting out your own introjects.",['Zara Maqbool'],"He said, “In any society where vulgarity is prevalent, there are consequences.”The Prime Minister also said women in Pakistan should remove “temptation” because “not everyone has willpower” and advised ‘purdah’—perhaps inspired by the first lady.

Just a few days ago, the child abuse scandal was something everyone was talking about. The media, the masses, the children; everyone wanted justice. It seems, however, that everyone has forgotten about the whole thing a little too soon. The number of write-ups coming in about child abuse has now started decreasing. Unlike the children killed in the APS massacre, these children are slowly fading from everyone’s memories. While many people reading this will disagree with me, deep down inside, everyone knows that this scandal was just another piece of news.

What makes this news story just another piece of news is the fact that this is something that is socially acceptable. Child marriages, despite being ‘illegal’ in the country, aren’t something unheard of. Even if the law makes child marriages illegal, religion grants such marriages a legal status, and religious law has always been superior to the law of the state.

Child marriages are not only acceptable, they are encouraged by religion. All those speaking up against this child abuse scandal will find their voices hushed when the same question arises in the context of child marriages. Girls as young as eight can be married, provided they’ve reached puberty. Girls as young as 12 years of age have given birth within many rural areas of Pakistan. In a country where such customs, backed by religion, prevail, child abuse may not come as a shock to many.

We speak against a minor’s rape, yet nobody speaks up if a 12-year-old is married to a man more than twice her age. Since marital rape has no legal standing, it becomes extremely easy for a young girl to be abused under the protection of an umbrella provided by religion and society. With such barbaric acts being committed under the label of social acceptance, clearly the child abuse scandal that unfolded failed to make an impact it would have in another society.

Religion alone cannot be blamed for this attitude of the masses. However, there is no denying the fact that religious acceptance of underage marriages has created tolerance for such incidents in our society. There is a fine line between child abuse outside of marriages and child abuse within marriage, the latter being something nobody wants to talk about owing to the criticism it attracts from religious circles. Unless we start questioning the things which have been acceptable due to the support they get from religion, we cannot eliminate certain fundamental flaws that continue to plague our society.",['Wishal Raheel'],"Share:Just a few days ago, the child abuse scandal was something everyone was talking about.

Two officers have been arrested after the girl burnt herself outside the police station. She was rushed to hospital but she succumbed to her injuries. The questions which are raised are why her complaint wasn’t registered? Were the police officers supporting their colleague? When she went to register the complaint one police officer behaved rudely & told her to leave the station.

The government which claims to work for the welfare of people of Pakistan hasn’t taken any step against this. We are living in the Islamic Republic Of Pakistan and our women are not safe.

On Wednesday, the girl, a student of class 9, was allegedly dragged to a sugarcane field in the Harduaganj area of the city, where the men allegedly raped and brutalized her before strangling her with her dupatta or scarf. The men had come on two bikes, according to the police.

Her mutilated body was found hours later by villagers. They allegedly did not allow the body to be removed for a long time, angry with the police and accusing them of not taking action.

Four policemen were allegedly attacked by villagers, after which senior officers arrived with a larger contingent.

Two persons have reportedly been picked up for questioning but no arrests have been made till now.

""We received information that the dead body of a small girl has been found in the sugarcane fields. We came and investigated the areas, the body has been sent for examination. The reason for the girl's death will be clear after post-mortem,"" said senior police officer J Ravinder Goud.

The incident has been compared to the gang-rape and torture of a young medical student on a bus in Delhi in December, 2012. Jyoti Singh, who had been brutalised with an iron rod, died 13 days later. One of her attackers who was a minor at the time was released last week. Parliament has now passed a law which defines when offenders who are 16 and above can be tried and punished like adults.

https://nation.com.pk/12-Mar-2014/us-senate-passes-military-sex-assault-bill,2014-03-12 01:18:52+05:00,US Senate passes military sex assault bill,"Share:

WASHINGTON : The US Senate has voted 97-0 to pass reforms in how the military handles sexual assault cases, but it probably will be months before the changes become law.

The measure must still be approved by the House of Representatives, where Democratic and Republican aides said it is unlikely to be up for a vote until later in 2014.

Backed by Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, the bill includes significant changes such as eliminating the ""good soldier"" Defence allowing a court to reduce the sentences of offenders who have strong military records.

It also strengthens prosecutors' role in advising commanders on whether to go to court martial. But it falls short of shifting the decision on whether to pursue assault cases from top commanders to independent military prosecutors.

That proposed change in the military justice system was part of a separate bill on sexual assault in the military, backed by another Democratic senator, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, which failed in the Senate last week.

Lawmakers and the military have been debating for months how to handle sex crimes in the ranks after a report almost a year ago that unwanted sexual contact, from groping to rape, had jumped by 37 percent in 2012, to 26,000 cases.

Despite deep divides in Congress over how best to deal with the issue, lawmakers passed reforms late last year in the 2014 Defence authorization law. Those included stripping commanders of their power to overturn jury convictions and assigning an independent legal counsel to victims who report assaults.

McCaskill said she hoped the Senate's strong support for her bill would help get the measure through the House. ""I'll continue fighting ... to get this bill across the finish line,"" she said in a statement.

High-profile military sexual assault cases, some involving Defence officials responsible for prosecuting sex crimes, also contributed to charges that the Pentagon has not been serious enough about stopping an epidemic of sexual assaults seen as a ""cancer"" in the armed forces.

Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Morse, a top Army sexual assault prosecutor, was suspended recently pending an investigation into allegations he groped a female colleague, a military spokesman said last week.

And Brigadier General Jeffrey Sinclair pleaded guilty last week to having an adulterous affair, asking female officers for nude photos and possessing pornography on his laptop. A military trial is under way over sexual assault charges, which he has denied.

The bill that was passed on Monday is unlikely to go to the House as a standalone measure. Instead it is likely to be included as part of a bill expected later this year that authorizes Pentagon spending.

""Right now we're looking at the most likely vehicle for getting it passed in the House, which is probably as an amendment to the NDAA (National Defence Authorization Act),"" a Democratic aide said.

A Republican aide said the Defence bill could be passed out of the House in June. But it would have to get through the Senate before becoming law, a process that has taken months.

It’s a reality that women in Pakistan are always treated as second-class citizens so that’s why violence against women is openly practiced in our society.

Approximately 60 to 90 percent women in Pakistan have suffered from different forms of abuse such as rape, marital rape, domestic violence, psychological abuse, emotional abuse, honour killings, dowry violence, acid throwing, forced marriages, mob violence, stalking, sexual harassment and human trafficking. Violence against women is not a new phenomenon; in fact, it is an age-old worldwide problem. An estimated figure shows that more than 5000 women killed and buried every year, suffering from domestic violence while others are left mutilated. There has been a 20-25 percent increase in cases of violence against women reported every year.

Sadly during 2015, International NGOs recorded that six women were kidnapped, four raped, three committed suicide and six were murdered every single day in Pakistan. It should be kept in mind that women, along with men, are equal contributors to the progress and development of every nation or state. Therefore, they should also be treated as equal citizens and be given their due rights with equal opportunities.

Delivering a lecture on “Honour Killings: A Public Health Perspective” at the University of Health Sciences (UHS) on Friday, Dr Muazzam Nasrullah, a public health specialist teaching at Emory and West Virginia University, USA, stressed the need for giving voice to women who are oppressed and to create a more informed and supportive environment for advocacy and policy to eliminate violence against women.

“It’s a very unique kind of violence, because usually domestic violence is caused by husbands or partners, but this is often conducted by brothers or fathers,” he said.

VALLETTA - Critics brand the Commonwealth ineffectual, but its incoming chief believes the 53-country organisation can use its strength to achieve miracles - such as eradicating domestic violence.

Dominica-born lawyer Patricia Scotland, who was appointed the Commonwealth’s first female secretary-general on Friday, told AFP she would harness the international family’s “huge convening power”. Among her top priorities: “Action to combat any form of abuse against women”. “One in three women in our world suffer from domestic violence. It’s the greatest cause of morbidity between women and girls,” she said, adding that there was “a lot of work to do”.

“Forced marriage, female genital mutilation, child abduction... these issues affect all of us,” said the 60-year-old, who will take over the reins from Indian diplomat Kamalesh Sharma in April 2016.

Not everyone is convinced the Commonwealth, which includes vastly different countries accounting for around a third of the world’s population, is ready to tackle such issues.

A forum on women was included at the summit for the first time this year, but the failure for LGBT rights to get any serious floor time enraged activists - particularly as consensual homosexual activity is still only legal in 13 of the groups 53 countries, according to the Human Dignity Trust.

The baroness admitted that “there are lots of things we could do better”.

But although the organisation can never be forced to do anything, because it works by consensus, she insisted it “has never been more relevant than it is right now”.

“There’s so much friction in the world today. We’ve got Boko Haram, we’ve got ISIS (the Islamic State jihadist group), we’ve got terrorism, climate change,” said Scotland, a former attorney general to the British government.

“I think most of us are looking for vehicles where we can come together in partnership to try and hone the sort of solutions that the world absolutely needs today,” she said, adding that “if we choose, we could come together and do something quite extraordinary”. The Commonwealth’s potential can be seen in its work to eradicate polio, she said.

Leaders from Britain, Canada, Malta, Nigeria and Pakistan called this weekend for a push to ensure the disease is wiped off the face of the planet by the end of 2016. “We have a realistic prospect by perhaps next year of eradicating polio from our world,” Scotland said.

“It will only be the second time in the history of humanity that we’ve been able to eradicate a disease. If we can do that with polio, we can do that with other things too,” she said.

Born in Dominica to a Dominican mother and an Antiguan father, Scotland moved to Britain at a young age but kept her ties to the Caribbean. She says her heritage makes her a perfect representative for an organisation whose members span five different continents.

“I am essentially a child of the Commonwealth,” she said, standing on a hotel balcony overlooking the Mediterranean Sea in Malta, where her election was most heartily welcomed by the group’s numerous small island states.

“I am incredibly proud and humbled by the fact that I’ve been chosen to lead this endeavour, this fight in the next four years,” she said, adding that she wanted her mandate to be “a time of partnership and change”.

Of all the challenges facing the 66-year-old grouping, she said the most pressing was finding a way to play a part in the world’s debate over global warming.

“Climate change is the big existential threat that is facing us today. Many people like to think that the threat of climate change is for tomorrow, it isn’t,” she said.

And who better to act as a motor for change than the youth of the Commonwealth, where 60 percent of the total populations of member countries is under 30 years old.

More than half of university students in Australia were sexually harassed last year and seven percent sexually assaulted on at least one occasion, a ""disturbing"" new national study revealed Tuesday.

The findings came in an Australian Human Rights Commission report, conducted on behalf of the country's 39 universities that questioned more than 30,000 students, after years of activism by women's groups to discover the extent of the problem.

Women were three times as likely as men to be sexually assaulted and almost twice as likely to be sexually harassed, either on-campus, traveling to and from the university or at off-campus events endorsed by the institution.

""The unavoidable conclusion of the data... is that incidents of sexual assault and sexual harassment are occurring at unacceptable rates at Australian universities,"" said Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins.

""While anybody can experience sexual assault or sexual harassment, it is clear from the data that women at university experience these behaviours at disproportionately higher rates than men.

""This adds weight to the body of evidence that highlights disturbing rates of sexual violence against women in Australia.""

The report said almost a third of the harassment occurred on university grounds or in teaching spaces, while one in five of the assaults happened at a university or residence social event.

Australian universities, which have more than one million pupils enrolled, are hugely popular with international students, particularly from China and India.

Many of those affected -- including international students -- did not formally report the incident, with the vast majority saying their university did not do enough to provide clear direction on what to do and where to seek support.

""It broke my heart to read this report,"" Sophie Johnston, from the National Union of Students, told reporters. ""This is a cultural battle we are fighting everywhere.""

The report made nine recommendations, including the need to change attitudes and behaviour and to ensure an independent and systemic review of how universities respond.

Universities Australia, the body representing the country's university sector, immediately announced a 10-point plan to tackle the issue.

This included a 24/7 support line, new training for staff to recognise and deal with the problem, and a commitment to a follow-up survey to track progress.

""We send a strong and clear message today that these behaviours are not acceptable. Not on our campuses -- and not in Australian society,"" Universities Australia chair Margaret Gardner said.

https://nation.com.pk/07-Feb-2018/say-no-to-child-abuse,2018-02-06 23:51:52+05:00,Say no to child abuse,"Share:

It’s essential to talk about child abuse and raise awareness. But we can also prevent it (child abuse) by not letting it be a secret. Child abuse is a taboo in Pakistan, most of the educated people hesitate to discuss this matter. Owing to which culprits attack children without being afraid of their fate. There is nothing more brutal and shameful than the abuse, manipulation, and maltreatment of the infants of our society. Given this, our country’s rules and resources need to show the seriousness of these dreadful and horrible crimes.

In Pakistan, child abuse is growing like a cancer day by day. According to an NGO SAHIL, 11 cases of child abuse are reported in Pakistan every day. Recently, the entire nation remained shocked and condemned the brutal rape and killing of Zainab. Protests erupted, public condemned the incident vehemently and demanded strict punishment for the perpetrator. Supreme Court took notice of the case and the army chief also expressed grief over the matter. But the point is: whether we made any strategy for preventing such crimes in future? Definitely, the answer is a big, no! If there had been any strategy then the same kind of abominable crimes would not have been repeated. Protests, condemnation, taking notice of the incidents are the short-term solution. As a short-term solution, the particular criminal can be brought to justice but crime rate will not be reduced.

Suspending a few police officers or transferring them is just a political game, in order to satisfy the public that government is taking action on the crimes. It will never bring any kind of improvement in our system. Moreover, only our protests and condemnations cannot change the system but our wise decisions can do so.

In many countries, there is content in the state education syllabus about child protection. They teach children what sexual abuse is and how to keep themselves safe from the abuse. It is imperative to include lessons about sex education and self-protection in the syllabus in Pakistan. Through the help of lessons, children will get awareness on how to react to any unpleasant situation.

Besides this, parents are responsible to teach their children and make them aware of child abuse. In our society, parents don’t talk about this matter frankly with the children. There is a major pitfall and abusers take advantage of this point. According to a survey, 90% children get abused in or outside the home by their relatives or whom they know. That’s why it is important to make children aware of child abuse.

Furthermore, the police department in Pakistan has no capability to handle such child abuse cases. There are several flaws in the police system, which need to be detected for ensuring the effectiveness of the police. Crimes can only be reduced when the police department will be given advanced resources, equipment, and training. Importantly, police should be depoliticized and must be given free hand to act against criminals irrespective of any discrimination. Moreover, the police and the government need to implement laws with true spirit against child abuse to ensure the protection of children. Child abuse perpetrators must be punished strictly in order to discourage this kind of heinous and abominable cases.

KARACHI - Police on Sunday confirmed that an alleged incident of robbery reported in Malir area last week was actually an act of murder where a 20-year-old young woman killed her younger sister, Aleena, with the help of her fiance.

On December 6, it was reported that a 16-year-old girl was stabbed to death and her sister, Alveena, was wounded when they allegedly resisted a robbery attempt in their home.

However, addressing a press conference on Sunday, Senior Superintendent Police (SSP) Korangi Nauman Siddiqui said that Alveena had confessed to slitting the throat of her little sister after allegedly being blackmailed by Aleena and her friends for several days.

""It is an unfortunate incident,"" the SSP said as he opened his press conference in which he detailed the events that led to the teenage girl's murder.

According to the SSP, the deceased teenage girl and her friend, Ahsan, had been blackmailing Alveena with compromising photographs.

The SSP said that Alveena and her fiance of one and a half years, Mazhar, had at first considered killing Ahsan but decided against it.

They had then approached Kashif, another suspect who was questioned by police, for help in killing the younger sister but he had refused.

Kashif confessed to being approached by Alveena and Mazhar for the murder, the SSP said.

After he refused, the two then took it upon themselves to carry out the crime.

Siddiqui said that on December 5, Mazhar and Alveena had tried one last time to convince the 16-year-old to tell Ahsan to delete the pictures. When she refused, Mazhar held her down and Alveena slit her throat with a knife, the official said.

""She (Alveena) has confessed to it,"" Siddiqui said.

He said that after the murder, the accused had attempted to destroy the evidence, including mobile phones.

According to the SSP, the police had been suspicious of Alveena's involvement in the murder from the beginning but refrained from arresting her to first recover the evidence.

The police recovered six mobile phones, Rs76,000 in cash and a knife ─ the murder weapon ─ from Mazhar's house.

""Whatever the motive, they have carried out a brutal act of murder,"" Siddiqui said.

Responding to a question by a journalist, Siddiqui said that action should be carried out against Ahsan as well for blackmailing Alveena. The SSP was critical of the ""negative use of mobile phones"" and urged parents to be careful in providing the devices to their children.

The SSP credited the station house officer of Saudabad, the district superintendent police and superintendent police for solving the murder.

Addressing the press after SSP Nauman, Alveena confessed that she had killed her sister.

""She (Aleena) was torturing me mentally,"" the accused said. ""They were threatening to upload the video on social media.""

Alveena claimed that she had begged the blackmailers repeatedly to delete a compromising video of her but Aleena and her friend Ahsan had refused.

""Ahsan should not be released. He made me kill my sister,"" Alveena said. ""I had no choice. Ahsan should be given the strictest punishment."" ""He made my sister make the video of me and then used it to blackmail me.""",['Monitoring Desk'],"On December 6, it was reported that a 16-year-old girl was stabbed to death and her sister, Alveena, was wounded when they allegedly resisted a robbery attempt in their home.

Pakistan, being a Democratic and sovereign state still faces inequality on the fronts of gender and religion. Those who have political power are the source of backwardness of women in Pakistan because they advocate the subordination of women. However, Pakistan has a dual system; civic and Sharia. The constitution of Pakistan recognized equality between males and females. Article 25 states” there shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex “. Recently, the” All Pakistan Ulema Council “ discredited honor killing.

Despite all of this, the domestic abuse, child marriage, the forced marriage, and rape cases are prevalent. The rape victims are not allowed to use DNA for proving the case. In fact, women who report harassment are disrespected by police. Moreover, it’s said the “ Child Marriage Restraint Act “ made it illegal for girls at the age of 16 to be married but it is found in many areas. Likewise, “vani” is a child marriage custom found in Punjab. 21% of girls under the age of 18 and 3% under 16 get married. A report stated the percentage of child marriage remained high with 72 in Sindh. Indeed, 33% of women face physical abuse and the educational status of women in Pakistan is the lowest in the world.

Out of 7.261 million children out of schools, 58% are females and the ones who go become the victims of acid throwing. Hence, Pakistan can’t be developed if women are kept in such conditions.

KABUL- Five men convicted of a gang-rape and armed robbery in the Paghman district of Kabul province of Afghanistan and a notorious criminal Habib Istalif were hanged today, an official said.

An official at the Attorney General's Office said the five men and the notorious serial killer Istalif were executed at the Pul-i-Charkhi prison in the afternoon. The men were brought in ambulances to the prison under tight security measures. Journalists were invited to the prison but were barred from

entering the premises. Former President Hamid Karzai had approved and signed the execution order

for the five rapists and Islatif before leaving office last month.

Police had arrested eight men in the gang-rape case that took place in August in the Paghman district near the capital Kabul. The men, some dressed in police uniforms, stopped a family's car returning

from a wedding and sexually assaulted four of the women in the family, including one who was pregnant. Three of the suspects remain at large. Thefive were convicted and sentenced to death amid criticism from the UN and rights groups.

Istalif had been convicted of numerous crimes, including murders, armed clashes with security forces, kidnappings and his links to international mafia groups. The Attorney General Office (AGO) had said that 10 people were involved in the rape incident and seven of them had been arrested.

A primary court handed death sentences to all the seven detainees but a higher court converted the death sentences of two of them into 20 years in jail. The trial was criticized by the United Nations and rights' groups amid a nationwide outcry over the incident. They were found guilty at a nationally-televised trial that lasted only two hours, and the sentences were quickly confirmed by the appeals court and the Supreme Court.

But the court process raised major concerns, with the UN high commissioner for human rights and Amnesty International calling for President Ashraf Ghani, who was sworn in last week, to stay the death penalties.

""The proceedings risk denying adequate justice to both the victims of this terrible crime and the accused,"" the UN agency said in a statement. Amnesty said the trials had been hurried, giving lawyers little time to

prepare the defence. It was only nine days between the arrests and the handing down of death sentences by the primary court. ""The trials have been marred by inconsistencies, un-investigated torture

claims and political interference,"" Amnesty said.",[],"Share:KABUL- Five men convicted of a gang-rape and armed robbery in the Paghman district of Kabul province of Afghanistan and a notorious criminal Habib Istalif were hanged today, an official said.

Islamabad - Australia’s Acting High Commissioner Brek Batley and Kashf Foundation’s Founder Roshaneh Zafar yesterday hosted a panel discussion on the successful completion of ‘Aakhri Station’ a mini-series, produced by Kashf Foundation and Khoosat Films with support from the Australian government.

The seven-episode series that went on-air from March 13 aims to generate discussion and addresses important social issues, including domestic violence and economic hardships faced by women.

Batley highlighted that empowering women and eliminating violence against the female gender is a top priority of the Australian government’s Foreign Policy White Paper that sets out the values, priorities, and interests of Australia’s international engagement over the next decade and beyond.

“Violence against women remains one of the key barriers to women’s empowerment and impacts negatively on economic growth. We have a comprehensive multi-year Ending Violence against Women program that provides support to survivors of gender-based violence in Pakistan. We’re strong advocates for the rights of women and the role of women in the political process,” Batley said.

He added: “Pakistan and Australia have just been elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council for 2018-2020 and we look forward to working with Pakistan in support of human rights for all of our citizens regardless of gender, globally.”

Roshaneh Zafar, Founder and Managing Director of Kashf Foundation, said Kashf Foundation had innovatively produced television campaigns that address and raise awareness on important social issues, stimulate dialogue and convey a message of hope and positivity among viewers.

“The story lines are based on real life incidences. We are committed to continue projecting heinous social issues in our future media campaigns until they are a matter of the past,” Roshaneh Zafar said.

The director Sarmad Khoosat, scriptwriter Amna Mufti and the cast of ‘Aakhri Station’ led the panel discussion.

“What I tried to achieve with this series was an honest, socially relevant, hard hitting story that provokes thought and brings these issues forward in the public discourse. I believe we were successful in accomplishing our goal through Aakhri Station,” said the director Sarmad Khoosat during the panel discussion.

“Writing Aakhri Station was a profoundly moving and emotional experience for me. These are not just seven stories but seven harsh realities that the society itself must face,” stated Amina Mufti, the writer of Aakhri Station.",['Our Staff Reporter'],"The seven-episode series that went on-air from March 13 aims to generate discussion and addresses important social issues, including domestic violence and economic hardships faced by women.

Mohammed Afzal Khan

The Valley of Jammu and Kashmir (Kashmir) is believed to be the most beautiful place on Earth and is consequently often referred to as the ‘Switzerland of the East.’ One would not imagine that such beauty could be beset by years of conflict, war and oppression. And yet, the people of Kashmir have endured such troubles since 1947, when India and Pakistan, both then under British colonial rule, became separate States. Kashmir, a largely Muslim populated area with an Indian Maharajah as its ruler at the time, was left aggressively contested by the two new States both making equal claim to its territory.

The notion of a Plebiscite, or a referendum as we may better understand it in light of the recent Scottish bid for independence, was agreed upon by Lord Mountbatten, India’s first governor-general who stated that the issue of Kashmir must be ‘settled by a reference to the people.’ India’s Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, also pledged a plebiscite for Held Kashmir and this was later enshrined in UN Security Council Resolutions.

Six decades on and the Held Kashmiri people have still not had this promise fulfilled. Instead, they have been caught in the middle as the victims of 3 ravaging wars between India and Pakistan over its territory and are currently under the oppressive occupation of the Indian government which maintains a massive military presence in the region.

On a ground level, the Kashmiri people have undergone immense suffering and humiliation as basic human rights are violated on a daily basis, killing and torture are commonplace and women, in particular, are brutally gang-raped and murdered. Mass graves have been found, mosques, homes and shops have been set to flame and families have been forced apart. The Indian-Pakistani separation, the ‘Berlin Wall’ of Kashmir, means that families living merely minutes away cannot access each other. Held Kashmir is often described as the world’s most beautiful prison due to the wide range of human rights abuses that have been catalogued and well documented in wake of the occupation.

Now, in light of the Scottish referendum that took place in the UK on 18th September, Kashmiri voices are calling for the promise of a plebiscite to be made real once and for all. Many Kashmiri voices are drawing on the British experience as an example of how demands for a say on their future could be resolved peacefully. The UK, which has held its strong union for over 300 years successfully, has been prepared to give the Scottish people the right to choose their own fate despite the fact that all three main English political parties were vehemently opposed to separation. Likewise, if India is truly committed to the value of democracy, it must also be prepared to afford the Kashmiri people the same right.

India claims to be the biggest democracy in the world. But this claim remains merely a label – or perhaps a showpiece to earn brownie points on the world stage – as long as the collective democratic right of the Kashmiri people is denied. Undoubtedly, the fear of losing Kashmir, particularly to Pakistan, is the greatest hindrance to India granting a Plebiscite. The UK, however, found itself in precisely the same position as English governments feared for the all-round social, political and economic stability of the country should Scotland break off. They did not cower, though, from their democratic responsibility to give the people a voice and instead rose to the game through peaceful, legitimate and un-coercive means of persuasion.

The underlying point here is that a true democracy is never marked by draconian laws or a need to resort to the deprivation of basic human rights for fear of losing control. But India’s rule in Kashmir, for the last 40 years at least, has been dominated by ‘emergency rule’ and government insecurity is such that, under the Special Powers Act, soldiers can shoot on a mere basis of doubt. This comes disturbingly close to George Orwell’s fictional concept of ‘thought crime’, wherein the slightest thought of dissent is executionable by law.

India’s ‘Big Brother’ rule over Kashmir runs against the grain of the modern value system in which freedom and self-determination are hailed as the ultimate values of progress. Much smaller states than Kashmir have achieved independence through referendum, for example, East Timor. Other States seek to merge their systems and pool resources, such as in the example of the EU. Whatever the direction, the decision has been marked by choice and a realisation of the will of the people.

Should India wish to realise its own will to become a serious player on the world stage, it must review its human rights record. For one, India intends to build strong economic ties with the EU, the largest trading bloc in the world. At the heart of the EU project is an absolute commitment to peace and human rights. The European mind-set is haunted by the ghost of its bloody and dictatorial past, when the mere right to freedom of belief and expression was denied. The return to, or association with, any such system of law is abhorrent to the government and people of the EU. The denial of a whole people their basic right to choose, such as is currently the case in Kashmir, is therefore not something that would fare well for India when discussing EU trade relations.

Secondly, India aims to become a permanent member of the United Nations, an International body for world peace and security. India has, however, categorically defied the 74 UN Resolutions that have been passed for the freedom of the Kashmiri people. The brazen expectation to be able to join the UN whilst openly flouting its rules provides somewhat of an insight into the Indian mentality – one that fails to understand that size, economic prowess and a superficial practice of Western secular values is not enough to gain the sort of prestige it yearns for. A genuine commitment to democracy, legitimacy and fairness for the sake of justice, equality and peace is what is needed to be taken seriously in the world.

Finally, India must learn from the lessons of the past. Peaceful and democratic methods of negotiation and decision-making, no matter how painstakingly slow and bureaucratic they can sometimes be, are always preferable to violent conflict and war. The particular danger with the Kashmir conflict is that both India and Pakistan are nuclear powers, risking turning Kashmir into a devastating nuclear target. History has taught us time and time again that the price of war is far too high and simply not worth it. With the danger of risking countless civilian lives, devastating civilian infrastructures and landscapes and essentially turning a country into mere blood and rubble, the question would be what worth would any more war or conflict over Kashmir have for either India or Pakistan, or indeed for the world.

We live in a world where we see the best and worst examples of human living. On the one hand, we witness the success of the EU project as it replaces war and conflict with peace, democracy and togetherness. On the other, we still have 55 million people living under the poverty line in India. Both situations are strong indications that war is simply not needed, firstly, because there are alternative ways of reaching decisions and secondly, because the world’s resources are already depleted enough. India has a clear choice to make; does it want the way of war and devastation or the way of peace and prosperity for South Asia as in the example of the EU?

Should India wish to live up to its claim of democracy and earn its respect on the world stage, it must summon up the courage to take a new direction, a direction of peace and democracy. India must follow in the footsteps of the recent Scottish referendum and grant the Kashmiri people their right to a Plebiscite. The voice of Kashmir has been silenced for far too long and their basic right to a democratic vote and self-determination must now be realised. Should it not be, India risks losing everything, from its standing in the world both politically and economically, to the will and good faith of the Kashmiri people themselves and to the very legitimacy it demands right now as the world’s largest functioning democracy.

Early on Sunday, at least three armed men, Mehar Naeem, Nadeem and Bao Saleem, shot dead Sameer Ahmad, son of local PPP worker, namely Muneer Ahmed, in Rehmatpura-Bheeko Chhor village. Reports say that the boy mistakenly entered into the fields of their political rivals while he was playing nearby.

Family of the victim, Federal Information and Broadcasting Minister Firdous Ashiq Awan, hundreds of PPP activists and MPA Tahir Mehmood Hundali also participated in the demonstration. The protesters placed the dead body in the middle of the square and also burnt tyres causing a four-hour traffic blockade on various inter-city roads. Later, the demonstrators besieged the DPO office, where they chanted slogans against the police.

Interacting with the media, Firdous Ashiq Awan lashed out at the Sialkot Police and the PML-N, saying Sialkot had become a “police state”. She said lawlessness was at its peak in Sialkot due to the alleged support of the PML-N to certain influential criminals. “Everyone is terrified here. The citizens’ lives are at stake,” Firdous asserted as she asked Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif to provide justice to the family of Sameer and immediately arrest his murderers. She also termed the murder as a politically-motivated one, and called Sunday as “black day” in the history of Sialkot.

Later, Firdous Ashiq Awan and MPA Tahir Mehmood Hundali met DPO Syed Ali Mohsin and demanded immediate registration of a case against the accused and their early arrest. They told the DPO that the whole day had passed, but Inspector Hameed Warraich (SHO of the Saddar Police Station) was reluctant to register a murder case against as many as 10 influential accused people.

Witnesses say that Sameer Ahmed was brutally beaten up by Naeem, Nadeem and Saleem. When his father, Muneer Ahmed, went to his rivals and asked about the reason for thrashing his son, they also tortured him and then shot fires at the boy, killing him instantly. The witnesses add that the accused then chanted slogans eulogising their party, after killing the boy. Dozens of locals witnessed this gruesome killing, but did not take any action against the “killers” who resorted to aerial firing, creating harassment and panic among the locals.

According to a police official, a case has been registered against the killers on the orders of the DPO. No arrest was made until the filing of this report.

ISLAMABAD - Senate Standing Committee on Commerce and Textile on Thursday expressed displeasure over the performance of Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) that failed to enhance the country’s exports in last several years.

Senate Standing Committee on Commerce and Textile, which met under the chair of Mirza Mohammad Afridi, discussed three points’ agenda. The committee members were annoyed over the performance of TDAP, which has the mandate to increase the country’s exports. However, they noted that TDAP has failed to increase the exports of the country in last many years. Senators have noted that TDAP has become burden over the national kitty. TDAP has no fund to organize exhibitions in other countries, which is essential for enhancing the exports of the country. The committee has sought detailed performance report of the TDAP from the ministry of commerce in next meeting.

The committee has also recommended the government to appoint chairman Export Processing Zone Authority (EPZA) immediately. The committee members noted that EPZA is a platform, which could play important role in increasing foreign exchange reserves and foreign investment in the country. Senators said that government should appoint EPZA head with immediate effect to make it functional.

The parliamentary committee has stressed the need for eliminating under-invoicing to check money-laundering through trade of IT equipment. Committee chairman Afridi said that committee is giving importance to resolve under invoicing issue, as it is one of the major problems in economy. He said that government should formulate a strategy to control the under invoicing. Senator Shibili Faraz said that economy is facing massive loss due to the under invoicing. It is also affecting the local production.

The committee was informed that government has formulated a mechanism to control under-invoicing through trade of IT equipment. The exports of IT equipment would be cleared under the new mechanism. Earlier, the companies, which were importing computers and other equipments, were involved in under-invoicing that resulted in massive loss to the national exchequer. Member Federal Board of Revenue Jawad Agha informed the committee that taxes and duties on the import of IT equipments are not high in Pakistan.

Chairman Afridi said that committee had highlighted the issue of under-invoicing. After that, the FBR had also identified $5 million under-invoicing in IT sector. Therefore, the government had accepted the committee recommendation and formulated strategy to check the under-voicing. The FBR had also appreciated the Senate Standing Committee on Commerce and Textile’s role in identifying the issue of under-invoicing, which is causing huge loss to the national exchequer.

Officials of Customs Intelligence informed the committee that there were 17 cases that found in under-invoicing through trade of IT equipment. The committee was further informed that they are also reviewing banking channels to check the under-invoicing through trade of IT equipment. Later, the committee has directed the government to submit detailed report on the issue of under-invoicing through trade of IT equipment by March 15, 2020. The committee has noted that there is need to improve the performance of Pakistan Revenue Automation (Pvt.) Ltd, (PRAL). Senator Dilawal Khan said that the government should audit the PRAL.

The committee meeting was attended by Senators Shibli Faraz, Dilawar Khan, Ghous Mohammad Niazi, Nuzhat Sadiq, Atta-ur-Rehman and officials of ministry of commerce and Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).",['Imran Ali Kundi'],"Share:ISLAMABAD - Senate Standing Committee on Commerce and Textile on Thursday expressed displeasure over the performance of Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) that failed to enhance the country’s exports in last several years.

Islamabad-Aisha* and Rehan*, two 24-year-old students of a medical school in Islamabad, were recently stopped by two policemen in H-8 neighbourhood. Both were perplexed as there was no traffic violation, they did not jump a red signal or drove rashly.

To their utter shock, the policemen asked them why they were driving slowly on a rather deserted road.

Soon, the questions turned towards a more personal nature. They were asked about the nature of their relationship.

Once the couple divulged that they were just friends, the policemen threatened to call their parents after accusing the couple of indulging in “immoral activities”.

While one police official talked with Rehan, the other kept eyeing Aisha in a lecherous manner. The couple was nervous and did not want their parents to get involved. The policemen offered an easy way out - give some money and get permission to leave. Rehan took out Rs2,000 from his wallet and handed over to one official. The policemen hugged him and left.

Several other couples have reported being harassed by the police, mostly by two officials riding a motorbike. Couples are being harassed in F-6 and I-8 neighbourhoods.

In another recent ironic incident, two cops intercepted a car after sunset upon seeing a boy and a girl driving alone in F-8.

The boy was asked to step out of the car and questioned about his relationship with the girl and why they were alone in the car.

However, to the policeman’s embarrassment, it turned out that the boy and girl were, in fact, siblings. The policemen let them go but offered no apology. In some cases, where couples have refused to bribe corrupt officials, they have been threatened to be charged with section 294 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) which reads: “Obscene acts and songs: Whoever, to the annoyance of others, a) does any obscene act in any public place, or (b) sings, recites or utters any obscene songs, ballad or words, in or near any public place, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine, or with both.”

When asked about how police extortion works, Abdullah*, a 22-year-old student, said that there are two policemen patrolling places on their bikes such as parks, dark parking areas, and empty roads.

“If they catch you doing something wrong or even just simply sitting in a car alone, they stop and search you, question you about your relationship, after which they take your identity cards and demand your parent’s number. Once they are sure they have caught you red handed or find out that you are scared that your parents might find out. They exploit that fear and take a look at how much money you got. Then one plays good cop, and the other plays bad cop. Gradually they move on to the settlement ‘fee,’ depending on how much they found in your wallet,” he said.

Hania*, a marketing manager at a public telecom office, was sitting with a colleague, discussing a new campaign during their office break at the Haunted Hill, a park in F-7, recently. Suddenly, two policemen approached them and started questioning them in the middle of the day regarding who they were and why there were sitting so close to one another. After a lengthy discussion, the police agreed to let them go after they paid them some money for “chai paani.”

Hania and her colleague did not have cash. But the policemen were very determined. They followed Hania and her colleague all the way to the ATM and allowed them to go only after they received approximately Rs3,000.

Kainat*, a resident of federal capital, said that police must stop the harassment. “They are themselves corrupt, harassing and extorting bribes from young couples,” she said.

“Anything that is not expressly prohibited is not illegal and, as per PPC, there is no law that explicitly forbids a man and a woman to sit or travel in a vehicle alone,” said Ahmad Waqqas*, a lawyer based in Islamabad. “The police is illegally harassing and blackmailing people, taking advantage of their uniform, to make some extra cash,” he said.

ISLAMABAD - Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) Chairman Muhammad Khan Sheerani has said some clauses of the Domestic Violence Bill adopted by the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly are in ‘conflict with Islamic laws’.

The council will come up with formal recommendations on it today, he told the media after the CII meeting yesterday.

Sheerani said the council discussed the Domestic Violence Bill in its session and they would continue debate on it as well as the Punjab Protection of Women against Violence Act 2016 in their today’s sitting.

In reply to a question, Sheerani said since he did not went through the Punjab’s piece of legislation, he could not comment on it. He said he has sought its Urdu translation and the council members would deliberate upon it today.

However, he saw some clauses of KP bill being in conflict with Islamic laws and said that as Islam is the state religion; therefore, no law can be passed in the country which is in conflict with Islamic injunctions. The CII chairman said women rights are protected in Islam and opined that there is no need of any other law for protecting their rights.

Sheerani said by making laws repugnant to Islam, the governments and assemblies were violating the Objectives Resolution adopted in 1949 and the constitution of Pakistan. He called for invoking Article 6 of the constitution against them for committing such ‘grave mistakes’.

He stressed that legislatures should take the advice of CII, a constitutional body, before making such laws and recalled the General Zia’s era when no legislation could be done without clearance from the council. According to Article 227 and 228 of the constitution, no law which is repugnant to Islam could be enacted and in this connection the council under the constitution is required to intimate the timeframe it requires to wet the bill or law within 15 days of receipt of the same to respective federal or provincial government.

LHC REFUSES TO HEAR PLEA AGAINST WPA

Staff Reporter from Lahore adds: Justice Shahid Waheed of the Lahore High Court yesterday refused to hear a writ petition filed against Protection of Women Against Violence Act 2016 as un-Islamic holding that it did not come under the jurisdiction of the court. The judge observed that the petition was related to Islamic injunctions and the higher court had no power to take up such matter. “Under Article 203(d) of the Constitution, Federal Shariat Court is the proper forum to take up such matter, the judge remarked.

A teenage boy killed himself after he was bullied because he was good-looking and girls were attracted to him, his parents have said following an inquest, reported The Telegraph.

Brandon Rayat, 15, hanged himself in his bedroom after months of being tormented by other teenagers who called him a ""paedophile"", sent him messages from a social media account in the name of Jimmy Savile and threatened to rape his mother.

The schoolboy, from Leicester, suffered both physical and mental abuse as well as ""online torture"" at the hands of bullies, every day for over a year until he could no longer attend school, and refused to leave his home for fear of seeing his tormentors, it was said.

His mother, Mina, who quit her job as a hairdresser to support her son, said: ""The bullies got in his head and sucked the life out of him, it just wasn't Brandon.

""Brandon was a handsome boy and a lot of girls took a shine to him as he got older. I think the bullies were jealous of that.

""He even shaved his hair off so he could be like them - he just wanted to be accepted. He wanted to go to university and become a doctor. He had his whole life planned out, but these boys were relentless.

""He used to love school, but within a few weeks of the bullying starting, he was asking us to move to another country so he would never see them again.""

Mina and Raj, Brandon's father, only realised that the bullying was serious when he had a breakdown.

Mina said: ""Some of his friends told us that he got a lot of attention from girls at school who liked him and that went against him.

""He had started telling me he didn't want to go school and that he didn't like the people there, but I didn't realise how bad thing were until he had the breakdown.

""He came running into the house one day and he was screaming, 'I want to die, I want to die'. I had never seen him like this before so I made a GP appointment.""

Brandon was then referred to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS), where he attended 11 appointments.

Despite his parents begging mental health professionals to hospitalise their son, they were told it would only increase his anxiety levels, it was said.

At an inquest into Brandon's death last month, a coroner concluded that Brandon took his own life and that opportunities had been missed by mental health services to assess him face-to-face after he had told a psychiatrist 11 days before his death that he had tried to kill himself.
