LAHORE - The Asian Human Rights Commission has urged United Nation to intervene in the case of Dr Afia Siddiqui's 11 year-old son, who is being kept in detention in violation of all international laws. In a statement issued here on Sunday, the AHRC demanded that the Afia's three children must be recovered and returned to family members, and that state authorities should be made accountable for their detention. That this young boy has been detained at all is of extreme concern. The AHRC urges the governments of the US, Pakistan and Afghanistan to respect and implement the rights of minors in the true spirit of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as signed/ratified by them. The child must be handed over to the maternal family as they have requested, and responsibility for his care and welfare must be fully accepted by his State Countries. The AHRC condemns the lack of transparency shown in this case of Dr Aafia and her children, and the lack of information and assistance given to the family of the missing minor while he was in state custody. The implications for the disappearance of her children, and the increasing but unsubstantiated reports of children being used as tools of interrogation and blackmail for terrorist suspects, are beyond chilling. The international community must keep a vigilant watch on the methods being used by all sides in this current conflict. AHRC is concerned to hear from the United States Department of Justice that an 11-year old boy, and US-Pakistani citizen, Muhammad Ahmad, has been illegally detained in Afghanistan since July 17, 2008 when his mother was allegedly arrested by the FBI. Strong attempts by his family in Pakistan and the US to gain custody of the child have failed, and with the mother extradited to the US, the condition and the whereabouts of the child are currently unconfirmed. The whereabouts of his two younger siblings, who mysteriously disappeared with the mother in March 2003, are also unknown. The concern is that Ahmad may be being used as a pawn in the US/Afghanistan war on terror and will be kept in custody indefinitely, or that he may disappear. His rights are being abused on a breathtaking number of counts, within the knowledge of three governments, all of which have signed or ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). According to article 2 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), no child should bear punishment or discrimination on the basis of the status, activities, expressed opinions or beliefs of the child's parents. Article 3 holds that in all actions concerning children, the best interest of the child shall be a primary consideration. Article 37 is more specific which says no child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily. Pakistan fighting us war: PTI President Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf Lahore Mian Mehmood-ur-Rasheed has said that the rulers were fighting the war of the US, which has put the national solidarity in danger. In a statement issued here on Sunday, he said that the rulers were continuing the polices of Pervaiz Musharraf and now Asif Zardari was going on foreign tour on the instructions of the US. Mehmood-ur-Rasheed urged the rulers to stop fighting the US war and take decisions keeping in view the interests of the nation.",['Our Staff Reporter'],"In a statement issued here on Sunday, the AHRC demanded that the Afia's three children must be recovered and returned to family members, and that state authorities should be made accountable for their detention.

KARACHI - The police have arrested three suspects over their alleged involvement in a murder of a 15-year-old servant in upscale Clifton locality here on Monday.

A fifteen-year-old Imran Ali, son of Qasim Ali was killed under mysterious circumstances inside a bungalow located at Block 8 within the limits of Clifton police station. The body of deceased has been taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and later, handed over to his family. Initially, the landlord of the bungalow claimed that the boy committed suicide over unexplained reasons on Friday, however, the police started investigations after the family of a victim claimed that he was murdered instead of committing suicide. According to Clifton SHO Javed Abro, the police have reinvestigated a case and found the landlord guilty. The officer said that the boy was murdered allegedly by a son of a landlord, Umair, watchman, Amjad and a driver.

The officer said that deceased hailed from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and used to work as housemaid at the bungalow from the last five months, adding that the police shifted his body to the hospital for his postmortem again which suggested that deceased boy was strangulated to death while the actual motive behind the incident is yet to be ascertained.

The officer said that the police have registered a case against the suspects and arrested the accused persons while further investigation was underway.

Last week, the cabinet had approved the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Ordinance 2020 and the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance 2020 in an effort of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government to curb the increasing rape cases.

The government intends to introduce tough laws at a time when there are rising incidents of rape in the country including motorway gang-rape case that had caused countrywide unrest among people.

The Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance proposes to amend the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 to effectively tackle the pervading instances of rape and sexual abuse of women and children.

The proposed law for the first time has included rape victims not only women, and children but also men and transgender persons.

The law widens the definition of rape by including provision of gang rape, and sexual violence, and defining the consent. It says that consent in rape would not be regarded “by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication” or if the victim is unable to understand the nature and consequences of that consent.

The law broadens the definition of penetration by including all its forms. It proposes establishment of special courts for speedy trials in rape cases.

Tomorrow is a very important day in Pakistan’s history: February 12, National Women’s Day. On this day, 31 years ago, hundreds of women defied the ban on public assembly and marched peacefully before the Lahore High Court to protest a law that limited the legal rights of women. It was the first time in the history of Pakistan that women came out of their homes to assert their full and equal rights. The courage of these brave women is truly inspiring.

During my time in Pakistan as the United States Ambassador, I have had the honor to meet remarkable Pakistani women and to witness the courage and strength of the women of Pakistan, the vision and determination of female parliamentarians, and the vibrancy of Pakistan’s civil society – especially women’s organizations. Through their leadership, more girls are going to school, more expecting mothers have access to prenatal care, more women entrepreneurs are starting and growing businesses, and more women and girls are speaking out against gender-based violence, including early and forced marriage, exchange marriages, and so-called honor crimes. Significantly, more men are also speaking out against gender-based violence.

From Pakistan’s history, leaders such as Fatima Ali Jinnah helped pave the way for Pakistani women. We recognize that Pakistan has a rich history of women leaders, from the first female Prime Minister of a Muslim country, Benazir Bhutto, to the first female speaker of the National Assembly, Fahmida Mirza. There are hundreds of other female doctors, teachers, academics, businesswomen, scientists, athletes and activists who demonstrate the strong contributions women can make to society.

In fact, women from Pakistan are reaching exciting new heights, including a young woman who, at age 23, became the first Pakistani woman to summit Mount Everest last year. Another amazing athlete is a 19-year old rock climber who won her 28th national rock climbing competition— against the boys, and fought for the right to compete against them in the first place.

Hundreds of other courageous women are addressing social issues and tackling violence and discrimination, including the first ever Pakistani to win an Oscar for the film “Saving Face.” While the film highlights the horrific practice of acid-violence, it also celebrates the human spirit by showing how brave survivors and female members of Parliament worked together to address this problem. Other young women are fighting to improve Pakistan’s education system, and are working for organizations like Teach for Pakistan, which is helping to raise the quality and standards of government-run schools in some of the most challenging neighborhoods in Karachi.

Tomorrow, on National Women’s Day, we will welcome the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women’s Issues Catherine Russell, who will visit Pakistan for the first time. She will no doubt be impressed by the array of accomplishments Pakistan’s women have been able to advance despite the odds. She will see how female parliamentarians have set aside political differences to pass landmark legislation including the Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, the law strengthening penalties for acid attacks, and the Prevention of Anti-Women Practices Act (which outlaws practices such as the exchange of women and girls to settle disputes, and depriving women of their inheritance).

Ambassador Russell’s visit is important because it demonstrates how the United States has made women and girls a cornerstone of our foreign policy. We recognize that the major security, economic, environmental, and governance challenges that all nations face cannot be effectively addressed without the full participation and empowerment of women. As Secretary of State John Kerry said, “No country can get ahead if it leaves half of its people behind.”

During the 16-Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence Campaign that took place from November 25-December 10 last year, I participated in numerous events that the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad organized, including a training event for police officers on the new sexual harassment law and a workshop with school children to discuss how to prevent violence against women. At the workshop, we discussed the impact of gender-based violence and signed pledges to avoid and prevent violence against women.

We all have a collective responsibility to empower girls to speak up for themselves, and to educate boys to speak up for their sisters and mothers. We need to support greater advocacy efforts and increased interaction between policy makers and those who work in the field. We must support the inclusion of men, boys, and critical community stakeholders – such as religious leaders – in addressing and preventing violence and changing gender norms and attitudes. And we must, ultimately, overcome the deep-rooted gender inequalities that either tacitly allow or actively promote practices that are so damaging to women and girls around the world. As Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah said, “No nation can rise to the height of glory unless your women are side by side with you.”

On Pakistan’s National Women’s Day, the United States salutes the accomplishments and courage of all Pakistani women. I look forward to showing Ambassador Russell how Pakistani women are indeed powerful leaders, who are truly building better lives for themselves and future generations.

The National Assembly of Pakistan on Wednesday went orange to show solidarity with the global 16 Days of Activism campaign

against Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and officially launch it in Pakistan. In relevance to this day a special event was organized at Parliament House.

Speaker National Assembly, Mr. Asad Qaiser graced the event as the Chief Guest.

Secretary WPC Ms. Munaza Hassan gave the welcome remarks at the start of the event. Resident Coordinator United Nations in Pakistan, Mr. Julien Harneis addressed the event that was attended by parliamentarians, representatives of the government, UN agencies, civil society and media, both virtually and in-person at the National Assembly.

Addressing the event, Speaker National Assembly Asad Qaiser said: ""The Government is committed to end violence against women as a topmost priority.

It's time to recognize the role of women and take substantial steps for ensuring equal participation of women in legislation. Gender equality cannot be achieved without ending violence against women and girls. Women need to be encouraged and motivated and the incumbent government was committed for the protection of women's rights and providing them safe environment. In order to give women their due status, we also need to change the mindset and behavior. Joint efforts are needed to bring them into mainstream.""

While giving welcome remarks, Secretary Women's Parliamentary Caucus, Munaza Hassan said: ""The world is undergoing significant social, political, economic and environmental development, which leaves a deep mark on our people - especially women of every household. With Covid-19 resurgence, the world retreats inside homes due to lockdowns, making situation even worse

for women. Escalation in already existing pandemic of violence against women is quite visible. The Constitution of Pakistan negates any discrimination on the basis of gender. Its Articles 25(3) and 34 are the two most significant articles in favor of women. Article25 (3) states that nothing shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the protection of women. The Women's Parliamentary Caucus has been at the forefront of improving legislations for the rights of women and we will continue our efforts along with our trusted partners.""

Mr. Harneis appreciated the pledge taken by all participants during the event, and expressed the hope that each person would follow through on this pledge in their lives to prevent gender-based violence from happening in all public and private settings.

He also commended the WPC's role in promoting the agenda of women's rights and leadership in the country. While acknowledging that Pakistan has made great progress especially in the area of legislative and policy reform, the RC highlighted that there was a lot left to do for effective implementation of existing pro-women laws. ""The World Economic Forum places Pakistan at 151 out of 153 countries in its latest Global Gender Gap Report. But a positive sign is that women have around 24 percent representation in both houses of the Parliament, and women parliamentarians contributed 33 percent of the parliamentary business. With more women in power and decision-making, we can make great strides in advancing women's empowerment and gender equality and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls,"" he stated.

Women parliamentarians from several political parties as well as representatives from the government, UN agencies and civil society also participated in the event and pledged to put in efforts for ending violence against women and girls in Pakistan. They promised to play an active role in freeing the country from all forms of gender-based violence and discrimination and stand with and support survivors.

The event was jointly arranged by the Federal Women's Parliamentary Caucus (WPC) and UN Women Pakistan to kick off the 16 Days of Activism against GBV, a global campaign that takes place each year from 25th of November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, to 10th of December, International Human Rights Day, indicating that violence against

women is the most pervasive violation of human rights worldwide. The 16 Days campaign is used as an organizing strategy by individuals and organizations around the world to call for the prevention and elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls.

With the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, this year's theme for the 16 Days of Activism against GBV is ""Fund, Respond, Prevent, Collect!"" The theme calls for prioritizing support and funding to essential services for GBV prevention and response especially in the COVID-19 situation, supporting women's rights organizations working at the nexus of COVID-19 and GBV, declaring a national policy of zero tolerance for GBV with a concrete action plan, launching behavior change social mobilization campaigns, undertaking explicit measures to maintain services for survivors of GBV as essential during COVID-19 lockdowns, ensuring a continuum of adequate criminal justice response mechanisms, and collecting data with the aim to inform and improve GBV services and interventions.",[],"Share:The National Assembly of Pakistan on Wednesday went orange to show solidarity with the global 16 Days of Activism campaignagainst Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and officially launch it in Pakistan.

Stockholm-Police in Sweden say they’re struggling to control criminal “clans” exercising their own form of justice, amid an escalation of violent crime in what has long been a tranquil and safe country.

With close family loyalties and little regard for the authorities, a few dozen criminal gangs now wield considerable influence over some of Sweden’s disadvantaged neighbourhoods, say experts.

Shootings, bombings and grenade attacks have become regular events in cities and towns across the country. Media outlets report on drug wars, blackmail, and witnesses too fearful of repercussions to testify.

“Have you seen the movie ‘The Godfather’? Then you know what it’s like,” journalist Johanna Backstrom Lerneby, who wrote a book about one of Sweden’s most infamous crime families, told AFP.

Gang members tied to the family Backstrom Lerneby wrote about recently made headlines in Sweden when, during a feud with a rival gang in August, they set up makeshift roadblocks, stopping cars and asking to see passengers’ ID cards.

One young man interviewed by broadcaster SVT, who would not give his full name but claimed to be involved in the car checks, said the controls were set up to “protect residents and children in the area”.

The feud came to a halt in late August -- but not because police arrested any suspects.

Instead, members of several gangs met at a Gothenburg hotel and agreed to end hostilities, effectively ending the strife overnight.

“It’s very frustrating, because it is a good solution in the short term... but it was resolved in the wrong way,” local police officer Fredrik Terje told SVT, deploring that authorities had been sidelined as criminals set the agenda.

The problem of these “criminal clans” has made headlines since early September, when deputy police chief Mats Lofving told Swedish Radio there were at least 40 family-based criminal gangs in Sweden.

“Far from everyone wants to be a part of Swedish society,” Lofving said, adding these families had come to Sweden solely for the purpose of committing crime, bringing with them their own parallel systems of government.

Lofving said these families were making their way into business and politics in order to wield more formal influence, primarily in disadvantaged suburbs, many of which have a large proportion of residents with immigrant backgrounds.

Sweden has struggled to integrate many of its immigrants, with thousands failing to learn the language proficiently and find jobs in its highly skilled labour market.

“Those who live in these vulnerable areas are often relatively poor people who don’t have a choice, even if they wanted to move away,” Backstrom Lerneby said.

The violence has also harmed innocent bystanders. In early August, a 12-year-old girl was killed by a stray bullet in a drive-by shooting in Stockholm, sparking an outcry over the ruthless violence.

In early September, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven called the criminal gangs a “poison in our society that we need to get rid of”.",[],"With close family loyalties and little regard for the authorities, a few dozen criminal gangs now wield considerable influence over some of Sweden’s disadvantaged neighbourhoods, say experts.

JAKARTA : A 12-year-old boy is the sole survivor of a plane crash that killed eight people in mountainous eastern Indonesia, authorities said Sunday.

The Swiss-made Pilatus aircraft lost contact with air traffic control Saturday during what was supposed to be a flight of around 40 minutes in remote Papua province. The wreckage of the plane was found in a heavily forested area on a mountain side in the Oksibil subdistrict on Sunday morning. ""Eight passengers were found dead and one was found alive,"" Papua military spokesman Lieutenant colonel Dax Sianturi said.

""At the moment the cause of the crash has not been confirmed,"" he told AFP, adding an investigation would be carried out by the national transportation safety committee.

The plane, which was owned by private charter company Dimonim Air, was carrying seven passengers and two crew.

Before the accident, villagers in nearby Okatem reported hearing a loud roar followed by an explosion.

Search and rescue teams walked two hours to reach the crash site and were still recovering the bodies late morning.

Indonesia relies heavily on air transport to connect its thousands of islands but has a poor aviation safety record and has suffered several fatal crashes in recent years.

Papua is a particularly difficult area to reach.

Five people died after a small plane crashed near Wamena in Papua province in July last year.

Every day ten children are abused in Pakistan. In 2015, the Kasur child abuse scandal was brought to the forefront. Just about a year later in May 2016, a gang allegedly involved in a child sex and pornography case was arrested in the area of Mingora (Swat). In September 2016, the Kahuta child abuse and pornography scandal was reported. A recent addition to the list is the Sargodha child abuse scandal. Saadat Amin, the main suspect, was running an online pornography business for the last few years.

He lured children in by offering them computer education and paying the parents $50. However, despite the ongoing abuse, it was never reported. Pakistani police launched an investigation only after a tip off by the Norwegian embassy; which informed the police about catching a Norwegian national involved in child pornography and having accomplices in Pakistan. This reflects a gross failure on part of the police – neglecting to start investigations unless prompted from elsewhere is a dereliction of duty.

This is where we stand right now; a country blamed for being the home to terrorists and now being a hub of increasing child abuse. Law enforcement agencies, which are supposed to protect the citizens, are also accomplices in these acts. In the Kasur case, the police refused to take any action and blatantly granted favours to the suspects. Similarly, in the case of Saadat Amin, the police were using his hacking skills to catch other criminals. It is unfathomable that they were unaware of his activities.

During the year 2016, 2127 cases of child abuse were reported from across the country. According to a report by Sahil (a non-governmental organisation) there is a 36 percent increase in such incidents. While such statistics should be a cause for concern, Pakistani law makers refuse to treat the crime as a serious offence. The National Assembly rejected the ‘Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill 2016’ seeking to increase the magnitude of the penalty for the offenders – even discussing the issue in parliament is seen as taboo by most. It is not just one institution that is failing children currently – the government at large, law enforcement agencies and institutions are collectively responsible and must get their act together.",[],"In 2015, the Kasur child abuse scandal was brought to the forefront.

https://nation.com.pk/15-Apr-2021/veiled-vulgarity,2021-04-14 22:25:25+05:00,Veiled vulgarity,"Share:

Recently there has been great outrage at our holier-than-thou Prime Minister’s statement where he insinuated how women dress has a correlation with increasing cases of rape and sexual violence in the country. He said, “In any society where vulgarity is prevalent, there are consequences.”

The Prime Minister also said women in Pakistan should remove “temptation” because “not everyone has willpower” and advised ‘purdah’—perhaps inspired by the first lady.

I equally respect women who observe purdah and those who don’t. It’s an individual’s choice and their own value system of what purdah or lack of means for them.

The biggest argument for what IK stated—and I wish someone had questioned the esteemed PM—is that if vulgarity invites sexual offence then how do you explain a 5-year-old child being raped by grown up men?

As a therapist, I would like to give my insight into the psychology of an offender/abuser. First of all, my dear PM, temptation has nothing to do with a man wanting to rape or sexually assault a woman. It is also not as simple as saying not indulging in a non-permissible sexual act is about willpower or lack thereof.

The abuse by an abuser is about what is inside him and not what is outside of him. It’s not like ‘she made me do it.’ It’s more like ‘I want to do it and I don’t care if it’s a woman in a so-called vulgar dress or a purdah clad woman.’

Raping or sexually abusing someone is about the perpetrator and never about the victim. A sexual assaulter can be any kind of a person and studies have shown that some of the personality traits include apathy, narcissism and feelings of hostility and aggression towards women. Remember that a sexual assault is not about sexual gratification or sexual interest, but more about dominating the other as one always has ethical and healthy options of gratifying the same needs.

One common cause in our culture can be the need of such young men to exert superiority over their male peers by flaunting that they are highly sexual beings. Such men would most likely be failures in life and can feed into their false male egos by considering themselves an alpha male by sexual acts. The excessive watching of porn is also a contributing factor and can increase sexual frustration.

In any culture, being a male and a virgin is a lot of pressure and would be stigmatised. Many of these men are almost in a panic and sense of emergency to join the bandwagon of other male adults. In most cases, religious boundaries would not matter. Many of these men also feel that this act gives them a sense of dominance, especially in a patriarchal society like Pakistan where the male child is made to feel superior since he comes into the world. If he is not living a healthy socially active life, he would go for anything that can give a sense of this fake masculinity.

In our culture the shame around sexuality, patriarchy and dominance are all sublimated through a kind of dehumanisation in which women are seen as inferior beings to men. This makes it much easier for women to become the targets of bellicosity.

There is also another kind of rapist that looks for any opportunity of gratification and loses self-control under the influence of substance. Another type is the heartless rapist whose stimulus is to humiliate and degrade his victims. He might even have an undiagnosed mental health condition like psychosis or sadistic tendencies that leads him to this heinous crime.

Then there is the vindictive rapist or offender who has anger and hostility focused directly on women, maybe due to personal history. Such sexual offenders believe they are allowed to sexually attack women because they feel they have been hurt, rejected or wronged by women in the past.

There is also intergenerational trauma history that leads to such personalities being formed, which means a son growing up in a household where the father constantly has physically abused the mother will most likely turn him into an adult that does the same towards other women.

Sexual assault is an unforgivable act of violence and a crime. Unfortunately, a lot of the victims remain silent to avoid stigmatisation and being blamed by society, while their rapists go free. It gets ingrained in the psyche of the victim that she is to be blamed for what happened due to judgment by society. And when the head of a state makes such an irresponsible comment, I can’t even imagine how many more victims of abuse will remain silent or never come forward. Dear PM, please make an educative and responsible statement next time on such a sensitive and painful issue. Invite an expert to give you a better understanding into the psyche of such crimes before blurting out your own introjects.",['Zara Maqbool'],"He said, “In any society where vulgarity is prevalent, there are consequences.”The Prime Minister also said women in Pakistan should remove “temptation” because “not everyone has willpower” and advised ‘purdah’—perhaps inspired by the first lady.

The number of reported child sexual abuse cases in Pakistan has risen by 10 percent in the last year, with roughly 11 children abused every day, according to new statistics released Wednesday.

The report compiled by Sahil, a non-government organisation (NGO) working against child sexual abuse, says that a total of 4,139 cases were registered in 2016, an increase from 3,768 in 2015. The report says that 2,410 girls and 1,729 boys were victims of sexual exploitation last year. Some 45 percent of the victims were between the ages of six and 15.

Activists working to fight child abuse have said the problem is widespread but difficult to quantify because victims are often unwilling to speak out. Ejaz Ahmed Qureshi, the National Commissioner for Children, said at the report’s launch that the government’s own research shows that at least 40 million children in Pakistan that were living below the poverty line were in dire need of protection.

Sohail Ahmed, programme officer at Sahil, proposed separate desks for reporting child abuse cases at police stations. Also there should be child friendly courts and special training for all staff dealing with children, including teachers, doctors and policemen.

In 2015, Pakistan took a step towards punishing those guilty of abusing young girls with life imprisonment or even death after an influential parliamentary committee voted to amend the current laws.

But the amendment only appears to address the sexual abuse of girls aged 14 and under, not the boys.

Also in 2015, a huge scandal emerged involving at least 280 children who the lawyers said were filmed while being sexually abused, with their parents blackmailed over the footage.

The government of Pakistan and concerned authorities are completely failed to eliminate the rape culture in the country where the minor children’s lives are being destroyed by the gangs. The rape culture is very common and hundreds of small children were killed illegally after their abduction and rape in Pakistan.

Recently, a 21-year-old girl was kidnapped and allegedly raped in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Hadeed area within the limits of Steel Town when the girl along with her family members was standing near a park in Gulshan-i-Hadeed that three gangs had abducted and rapped her illegally. Actually, the children are considered the beauty of the country who need to be loved and cared by everyone but unfortunately, it is opposite in our society where instead of giving love, we are abducting and rapping them which is a very shameful act for everyone. Children need our love not abduction and illegal rape that we have made a rape culture in our country.

So the government of Pakistan and Police department must be alert to catch the gangs and punish them at any rate in order to save the lives of the children in our society. We hope that the Police would eradicate this issue from its root and stop the rape culture in Pakistan very soon.

The rape culture is very common and hundreds of small children were killed illegally after their abduction and rape in Pakistan.
Children need our love not abduction and illegal rape that we have made a rape culture in our country.
So the government of Pakistan and Police department must be alert to catch the gangs and punish them at any rate in order to save the lives of the children in our society.
We hope that the Police would eradicate this issue from its root and stop the rape culture in Pakistan very soon.","['lives', 'gangs', 'society', 'stop', 'children', 'need', 'pakistan', 'love', 'culture', 'illegally', 'rape']","{'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2018-07-14/1531594408-8878.jpg', 'https://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619912693.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/whatsapp_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/g_plus.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2018-07-14/candidate-vote-for-me-1531509288-1483.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png?date=2019-02-15', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_publishrr.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2018-07-14/those-greeting-nawaz-are-donkeys-says-imran-is-this-a-complement-or-a-slander-brother-1531509310-7237.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/uploads/theme/logo-1550475639.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619902433.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/rsss.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/linkedin_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/facebook.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/twitter.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/android_app_on_play_logo_small.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/utube.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/app-store.png'}",True,https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg,1,,,,,nation

LAHRORE The administration of a state-run-television is all set to save the 'skin of a senior news producer allegedly involved in an incident of sexual harassment with an intern of Lahore College for Women University which took place a few days back inside the office of Lahore Station. Informed sources in the television in Lahore Station revealed seconds after the incident happened that the accused producer namely Amjad Ali Shah, also a lawyer, was immediately suspended but all of the comments sought from the officials concerning during the inquiry held against him, have been given in his favour, perhaps in vast interest of the state-run-television. The inquiry was initiated against Mr Shah on special directions of Managing Director Yousuf Baig Mirza on the same day under his own chairmanship with two senior members including Director News Islamabad Khalid Warraich and General Manager Lahore Station Farrukh Bashir. 22-year-old girl Sonia, a student of Lahore College for Women was referred by the Head of Department of Mass Communication Professor Anjum Zia to the aforesaid television a month ago for internship. Sonia was attached to a senior news producer Amjad Ali Shah, who extended his all 'efforts to teach the professional technicalities of reporting, editing, script writing and others features to student, a senior member of the television said on condition of anonymity. He further said here on last Friday, the accused clutched her hand besides touching to her face resultantly the girl rushed out of the room and straightforwardly approached the office of GM Farrukh Bashir. The girl complained against the producer in written on which the GM after consulting to MD Yousuf Baig Mirza suspended the producer and announced official inquiry against him, he added. During the inquiry, the authorities sought comments from all of the officials and colleagues of Amjad Ali Shah. However the close quarters of Amjad, who belongs to Group VI of seniority structure of the institution, believed that a Senior News Editor Fayyaz Warraich monopolised the situation and tried to blackmail Amjad as Mr Warraich wishes to bring his blue-eyed Mansha Cheema, official of Group VI, on his post, a female official of the institution who wished not be named said. She further claimed Fayyaz Warraich, who belongs to Group VII and hails from Narowal, is near to his promotion in Group VIII and ultimately Amjad would be the most suitable person to replace him for the post of Senior News Editor. The incident is genuine but Mr Warriach was taking advantage from the situation, she added. However Fayyaz Warriach, when contacted, completely ruled out such narration. He said, I have written in my comments that as Mr Shah has claimed he just patted the girls face considering her like his daughter. If a person adopts someone as his daughter even in words then his statement should be honoured, he added. Mr Fayyaz further said Mr Shah was a 'respectable official of the state-run-television and he always tried his best to satisfy the interns while imparting them necessary technical education. GM Farrukh Bashir said the inquiry would be completed within a couple of days. He, however, avoided sharing the developments of the inquiry at this stage. Commenting on the incident, Miss Anjum Zia, Head of Department of Mass Communication of Lahore College for Women, said the girl was in her second last semester and was sent to the television for internship. Yes, the issue is in my knowledge but the student is not in my access now, she added. She, however, said the issue was grave in its nature if it has practically taken place. Faiza and Sadia Akbar, Gender Studies Department faculty members of the University of the Punjab, told TheNation a few days back, We have to face severe problems at public places as the eve teasers start ogling flirtatiously on the women waiting for the bus. According to them, all of them from a peon to a CEO are involved in this silent crime. Many females have to leave their jobs on account of the unwanted behaviors of their colleagues. A few start off with a mild acquaintance and later present their illicit wishes, they added.

LAHORE - ﻿﻿FIDA HUSSNAIN/ Agencies - World’s youngest suspect of attempted murder was acquitted Saturday after police withdrew charges against nine-month-old boy, who although unable to enter a plea gurgled throughout court hearings.

The super ‘baby villain’, Musa Khan was charged two weeks ago as part of a raid on suspected gas thieves involving at least 30 other suspects in Lahore’s Muslim Town.

The baby boy was originally charged with wilful murder attempt, resisting arrest, threatening police and interfering in state affairs. The judge on first hearing granted bail to Musa against bail bonds worth Rs50,000 and directed the accused family to appear again in the court on April 12.

At the initial hearing he seemed blissfully unaware what was going around him as he sucked on a bottle of milk in his grandfather’s lap. There were some gurgles from the baby during the initial arraignment.

The infant, who was apparently unaware that he has made world criminal history as the youngest ever murder suspect, was arrested by police in a move which observers suggest is not the finest hour of country’s justice system.

On Saturday, Lahore’s Muslim Town Police confessed in the court that Musa Khan was mistakenly nominated in the case, though they maintained charges against the other accused. After clearing of baby’s name, the accused family withdrew his bail application.

Quite restless and apparently terrified during the first hearing, Musa looked relatively calm in his grandfather Muhammad Yaseen’s arms during Saturday’s court appearance.

As proceedings started, police surrendered before the court saying that it was a ‘human error’ that Musa was named in the FIR. The police however made another ridiculous statement that the baby-boy registered in the case was another baby, who was only 10 days old, and not the one present in the court. The judge expressed dismay over incompetence of police officers and asked them whosoever the baby was, under which law he was booked in the case.

The judge issued show-cause notice to station house officer of Muslim Town Police and directed Capital City Police Officer to take action against criminal negligence of police officers responsible for this blunder. However, other accused in Musa Khan Case would face the charges of attempted murder.

On Feb 1, police registered the case against baby Musa, other members of his family and a number of his neighbours in Muslim Town neighbourhood after they allegedly attacked a bailiff and a raiding team of the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines (SNGPL) that went there to arrest people involved in gas theft.

Police accused Musa, his father and others of throwing stones at security guards in what others claim was a protest against shortages of electricity in the city. Police say the suspects tried to kill security officers by throwing stones at them. But Musa’s father, Ahmed –also an accused in the case –says the crowd was protesting an electricity shortage.

The country’s justice system has been held up to ridicule after baby, who is still weaning, was arrested and charged. More than anything else, abject embarrassment forced the local police to admit their mistake and drop the very serious charges against the baby after media highlighted this case. The child’s lawyer Irfan Tarar said that the decision was made after an admission that the original charges were invalid because the police had failed to investigate them.",['Fida Hussnain'],"The super ‘baby villain’, Musa Khan was charged two weeks ago as part of a raid on suspected gas thieves involving at least 30 other suspects in Lahore’s Muslim Town.

Badin SSP Hassan Sardar Niazi told this scribe that the primary suspect Soam Meghwar was arrested on early Tuesday from Hyderabad while the other two were still at large. He said that raids were being conducted to arrest the others.

An FIR was registered by the victim’s father, Dr Lakhman Parmar, on Monday with Tando Ghulam Ali police station under Sections of 322 (manslaughter), 506 (2) (punishment for criminal intimidation), 385 (putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion), 500 (defamation) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).

In the FIR, Dr Parmar complained that the three suspects had blackmailed his daughter for the past six months and had minted Rs 50,000 from her every month by sending her the edited pictures. He said that his daughter had taken an extreme step after she was sick of the continuous blackmail.

SSP Niazi had taken notice of the incident after it was raised by activists on social media who demanded justice for the family.

On Monday, he visited the family of the victim and assured them of his full support to trace down the suspects. He had directed station house officer (SHO) Tando Ghulam Ali Riaz Rind to arrest those involved in the blackmailing the victim.

The arrested Soam talking to the local journalists in police lock-ups denied the allegations and said that he himself surrendered to Hyderabad police when he came to know about the registration of the FIR against him. “She was like my sister and she had sent some amount for the purchase of android phone for her,” he pleaded.",['Our Staff Report'],"Share:BADIN - Police on Tuesday arrested the main suspect in relation to a girl’s suicide in Badin due to online blackmailing.

KARACHI- At least 1601 women were killed in Pakistan in the name of honor or for other reasons in 2013. According to data provided by the Madadgar National Helpline Founder Zia Ahmed Awan, at least 370 women were raped while 185 incidents of gang-rape were reported across the country. He said that 2133 women were tortured during the same year while 887 faced torture by police. Similarly, 608 women were abducted, some 406 were forcefully married which included 176 cases of Vani.

He said that 217 women were killed after being raped, 220 of them were killed after being accused of Karo-kari, 1164 women were killed for unknown reasons while 452 committed suicide.

I always knew that sexual abuse existed, preying on girls and boys of all ages, a predator that along with physically, mentally and emotionally hurting its victims, silenced them into carrying the burden of a secret that keeps them in a spiral of shame for years at end; a shame that never belonged to them to begin with.

Five years ago, I started learning about the complexity of sexual abuse as many of my clients shared stories of being abused as children, teenagers or adults by family members, teachers and trusted friends, and the most common theme that ran was how it was in therapy that they shared it for the first time.

It would take session after session as they would share what happened, overwhelmed with grief and exhaustion of carrying the pain and most importantly, the shame of not being able to tell anyone. They believed that their silence meant they were party to this heinous act and as a therapist, I tried my best to reassure the adult sitting in front of me that it was the abused child within them who was silenced into fear and submission. I tried my best to comfort that child who is so convinced that he or she made it happen.

For healing to begin, that’s where my work started. Peeling away layers after layers of shame that they inherited, unpacking their memories so they can remember how they were threatened into silence, how they waited for their parents to notice why suddenly they are losing their appetite and are withdrawn, hoping for someone to check on them as they sit alone with a Qaari saab or tuition teacher. That’s the beginning of healing as they start remembering the anguish, the fear of wanting to share what was going on but could not. They suffer from chronic symptoms that include anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.

I choose to write about this as a day before I read about how a teacher who ran the Model United Circuit (MUN) in Lahore at the esteemed Lahore Grammar School is allegedly involved in sexually harassment of A Level students for years to end. Some of the students have come forward with sharing texts sent out by this teacher and protesting and expressing how in spite of sharing this with the school administration, no action was taken until now, where the principal has expelled the alleged perpetrators. Simply expelled, claiming they have nothing to do with them, saving their school reputation and enabling more abuse as those men will continue in other spaces as sooner than later this event will be forgotten. That man should have been held accountable so justice could be served as well as a lesson for other perpetrators.

The point I am trying to raise here is that this is the dark and dynamic nature of sexual abuse. Most will keep it a secret for years and don’t you wonder why that is? Most often it remains hidden due to a combination of denial, manipulation, and confusion. The victim is manipulated into silence and a state of confusion that they are responsible for making it happen and that leads to the victim staying in denial that it ever really happened and becoming a secret keeper.

Unfortunately others that include their families do not believe some who get the courage to share or in this case as per the students claim the administration did not pay heed to their complaints. Only a rare few get the chance to heal from the trauma of abuse by being heard and validated by others.

Many of you who are reading this have been victims of sexual abuse. You are still keeping it silent believing that you asked for it and feeling shame for what was done to you and not by you. It is very hard to tell someone about it, isn’t it? And then you also believe what’s the point now? And how can just talking about it make it better? I have moved on. I no longer think about it. But that’s where you are wrong. That abuse is still part of your life and might be coming out in the depression and anxiety you face and you believe it’s because of a job failure or sickness. You might be getting physically ill too, whether it’s a migraine or a chronic muscular pain that refuses to get better.

Remember that it’s not your fault. Speaking up is the first step and the most difficult. Reach out to a professional. A trusted friend! Anyone! Talk about it and take the power away from your abuser who silenced you into shame for years. Today can be the day you don’t have to silently survive!!",['Zara Maqbool'],"I tried my best to comfort that child who is so convinced that he or she made it happen.

https://nation.com.pk/10-Feb-2020/child-abuse-and-deterrent-punishment,2020-02-09 23:15:50+05:00,Child Abuse and deterrent punishment,"Share:

On 7 February 2020, the national assembly of Pakistan passed a resolution calling for public hanging of child molesters. While the resolution was non-binding, meant for further debate and discussion only, it was met with sharp criticism. Those opposing the resolution included some members of the ruling party itself led by its federal Minister for human rights. Another federal Minister took to twitter asserting ‘this is just another grave act in line with brutal civilisation practices, societies act in a balanced way barbarianism is not an answer to crimes...... this is another expression of extremism’. Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, a national assembly member of PPP, stated, ‘we cannot put public hanging into practice. It violates the laws of the United Nations’. Likewise, condemnation also came from human rights bodies, particularly Amnesty international that rarely let go of any opportunity to remind Pakistan of its international obligation to abolish the death penalty under an optional protocol of ICCPR 1966. One human rights expert went on to claim that there is no empirical evidence to show that public hangings are a deterrent to crime or in protecting the psychosocial well being of children.

Admittedly, the issue of the death penalty for child molesters has been contentious, it would be over-simplistic to suggest that public hanging of such persons would make Pakistan a laughing stock in the world community and the country would violate its international commitments by doing this. The learned ministers and rights activists need to be reminded that Pakistan is a signatory to the UN Convention on Rights of the Child 1989 which obliges it to take effective measures to protect children against any kind of abuse. What steps have we taken so far to fulfil this duty? As to the claim of the lack of empirical evidence, one can reply that neither is there any empirical evidence to indicate public hanging would not be a deterrent to the crime.

Another way to interpret the non-binding resolution can be that the people of Pakistan have been outraged by a rising tide of child molestation and have come to a shared understanding, through their chosen representatives that further debate and discussion should take place to recommend appropriate measures to curb this ghastly crime. In response to the uproar against the resolution, suffice is to say that every country has its own social needs and indigenous circumstances which have to be kept in view while deciding what kind of punishment would be best suited to discourage a particular kind of criminality. Thus, for example, internal laws of at least three US states, of Louisiana, Texas and Montana provide the death penalty for the crime of child molestation. Similarly, India has enacted ‘The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012’ giving the death penalty to child rapists through speedy trial in special courts constituted for this purpose. In the same vein, China has a zero-tolerance policy towards child molestation and those who sexually abuse children and cause irreparable harm are destined to face the death penalty as required by Chinese law. These countries, while passing their internal laws, did not pay much heed to international outcry; by contrast, they considered what punishments would be best fitted to prevent the crime in their local conditions.

Everywhere in the world child molestation is regarded as a horrendous crime warranting rigorous measures for its control. This is so because the victim being a child is weak and vulnerable, and the trauma he/she experiences while going through abuse stays with him/her forever. Noticeably, there have been instances of people having nightmares even at the age of 60-70 years, of sexual abuse taken place in their childhood. Thus, states not affording the death penalty at least guarantee stricter punishments to repeat offenders, perpetrators, who victimise multiple children, and who stood in a position of trust concerning their victims. For example, states of Washington and Kansas passed so-called Sexual Predator Laws allowing offenders to be committed to mental institutions indefinitely after they have served their prison terms.

Psychologists believe that ‘paedophilia’ is a result of severe mental disorder and much like alcoholism, it cannot be ensured that the behaviour would not be repeated unless cured by sustained treatment. This mental illness can be treated either by ‘cognitive therapy’ or ‘chemical castration’ while cognitive therapy change sex offenders’ understanding of what they do and chemical castration eliminates the psychological cause of the urge. If these arrangements are available in your country, then, of course, the alternative punishments can be a more appropriate response to the crime. On the other hand, if your state does not have these facilities what option you are left with to deal with the criminality apart from deterrence. Of course, the modalities of deterrence could be discussed, debated upon and adapted, for instance, public hanging may not always be justifiable but this does not mean the seriousness of the offence can be denied because of the possible backlash of the international community.

Pakistan’s current legal regime protecting children against violence, exploitation and sexual abuse is inadequate, to say the least. Formerly, we had laws against sodomy or murder only, but in 2016 we enacted laws criminalising exploitation, abuse, trafficking etc. In January 2020, the parliament passed Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Act 2020 which aims to protect and raise an alert when a child goes missing or is abducted; the Act applies to Islamabad Capital Territory only.

The effectiveness of these laws is as yet to be tested. On a social level, it is thought to be a taboo in Pakistan to educate your child about sanctity and inviolability of his or her body. Use of forensics in criminal investigations is almost non-existent as per the statement of a former Chief Justice of Pakistan, and reporting of crimes is stigmatised, making it nearly impossible to prove the charge.

Under these circumstances, not having deterrent punishment can give a free license to paedophiles and sexual predators to implement their sinister designs without fear of consequences. If anyone has any alternative such as ‘cognitive therapy’ or ‘chemical castration’ they are more than welcome to take part in the on-going debate. However, silencing the discussion which reflects the consensus of the society to deal sternly with something so despicable, and that too under the apprehension of international fury would be nothing short of a tragedy.",['Dr Usman Hameed'],"Share:On 7 February 2020, the national assembly of Pakistan passed a resolution calling for public hanging of child molesters.

Formerly, we had laws against sodomy or murder only, but in 2016 we enacted laws criminalising exploitation, abuse, trafficking etc.","['international', 'public', 'punishment', 'death', 'sexual', 'laws', 'deterrent', 'abuse', 'penalty', 'pakistan', 'child', 'crime']","{'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/rsss.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/android_app_on_play_logo_small.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/g_plus.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/linkedin_share.png', 'https://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619912693.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png?date=2019-02-15', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/twitter.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_publishrr.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/utube.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/uploads/theme/logo-1550475639.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619902433.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/whatsapp_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/facebook.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/app-store.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2021-05-02/so-what-disaster-are-we-writing-about-today-stories-today-pandemic-pverty-scandal-1619896356-6502.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png'}",True,https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/no-image-large.jpg,1,,,,,nation

LAHORE - The Minar-i-Pakistan clad in orange light yesterday to mark the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-based Violence.

The unprecedented event was also aimed to reaffirm the commitment of the Provincial Women Development Department to end discriminatory attitude against women.

It is estimated that one woman in every three will be sexually or physically abused in her lifetime. In some countries, 40-70% of murdered women are killed by their partner.

On the occasion, Punjab Minster for Women Development Hameeda Waheedud Din said the provincial government stands committed to put an end to violence and discriminatory attitude towards women who constitute more than 50% of the population of Pakistan. As part of international campaign against gender based violence, the WDD has launched “Her Talk 2016” campaign about rights of women and their importance in the process of national development and prosperity, she informed the participants.

Under the “Orange the World” theme of UN, activities have been organised in most of the countries around the world with a purpose to reach out a maximum number of people, the minister added.

The 16 days of activism against gender-based violence, which began on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women last Friday, will end on Human Rights Day on 10 December.

WDD has embarked upon a robust campaign “her talk” to raise awareness with the active association of UNWOMEN, APWA and White Ribbon. Eminent activists of women rights and others have also been associated to join WDD in carrying out all activities towards this end.

Hameeda further informed that various competitions, walks, screening of Oscar winning documentary will help promote the cause and gender awareness campaign among all sections of the society. She also stressed the need to mobilise and activate women towards protection of their constitutional, legal and moral rights.

The Minar-i-Pakistan, soaring into the sky in Iqbal Park at 60m, was built in 1960. It commemorates the signing of the Pakistan Resolution on 23 March 1940 by the All India Muslim League, which paved the way for the founding of Pakistan.",['Our Staff Reporter'],"Share:LAHORE - The Minar-i-Pakistan clad in orange light yesterday to mark the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-based Violence.

ISLAMABAD - The National Assembly on Friday passed a resolution to form a 10-member special committee to look into child abuse cases for curbing such crimes by making full use of legal remedies, effective investigation and speedy prosecution.

The house adopted the motion after the murder of a seven-year-old girl in Kasur district of Punjab sent shock waves throughout the country.

The committee, according to the resolution moved by Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Sheikh Aftab, will present its report to the house within a month.

The multi-party committee members, comprised Talal Chaudhry, Marriyam Aurangzeb, Zahid Hamid, Shaista Pervaiz, Shahida Akhtar Ali, Romina Khurshid, Azra Fazl Pechuho, Muhammad Khan, Kihwar Zehra and Sahibzada Tariqullh.

“The speaker is authorised to make such changes in the composition of the committee as and when so required,” the motion read mentioning that the members will recommend measures to stop child abuse incidents such as the Zainab case.

The house has already debated the Kasur tragedy with some of the lawmakers demanding ‘public execution’ of the culprit.

Minister of State for SAFRON Ghalib Khan, responding to a call-attention notice, said that the army was making efforts to clear areas from land-mines in South Waziristan Agency, which result in the deaths of hundreds of unsuspecting people. To a question about a compensation for the affected tribal people, the minister agreed with lawmakers for a proper compensation.

Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf lawmakers for the second day made attempts to take the floor apparently to settle the score with the treasury benches for passing a resolution condemning their chief for making disparaging remarks against the parliament.

PTI lawmaker Murad Saeed pointed out the quorum when he was not given the floor.

After he pointed out the quorum, Deputy Speaker Murtaza Javed Abbasi abruptly adjourned the proceeding due to a very thin presence of the lawmakers in the house.

PTI lawmakers, Murad Saeed, Shehryar Afridi, Hamidul Haq also resorted to derogatory remarks when they could not get the floor. The house, with the onset of the proceedings, saw a very thin presence of the lawmakers from both sides of the aisle.

The house also offered Fateha for renowned literary figure and columnist Munno Bhai and former chief of PAEC Dr Ahfaq Ahmed.","['presence', 'sexual', 'house', 'remarks', 'forms', 'children', 'abuse', 'lawmakers', 'speaker', 'body', 'making', 'saeed', 'quorum', 'protect', 'committee', 'resolution']","{'https://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619912693.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/whatsapp_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2018-01-20/parliament-a-den-of-criminals-1516388892-9357.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/g_plus.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png?date=2019-02-15', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_publishrr.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/uploads/theme/logo-1550475639.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619902433.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/rsss.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/linkedin_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/facebook.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2018-01-20/1516388915-5472.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/twitter.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2018-01-20/na-forms-body-to-protect-children-from-sexual-abuse-1516401069-9595.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/android_app_on_play_logo_small.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2018-01-20/na-forms-body-to-protect-children-from-sexual-abuse-1516401069-9595.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/utube.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/app-store.png'}",True,https://nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2018-01-20/na-forms-body-to-protect-children-from-sexual-abuse-1516401069-9595.jpg,1,,,,,nation

Ohio-The killing of a gorilla at the Cincinnati Zoo after a 4-year-old boy tumbled into the ape’s enclosure triggered outrage and questions about safety, but zoo officials called the decision to use lethal force a tough but necessary choice. More than 2,000 people signed a petition on Change.org that sharply criticized the Cincinnati Police Department and the zoo for putting down the animal and called for the child’s parents to be “held accountable for their actions of not supervising their child.” Cincinnati police on Sunday said the parents had not been charged, but that charges could eventually be sought by the Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney. A spokeswoman for the prosecutor did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Authorities did not identify the child or his parents. The family could not be reached on Sunday. A Facebook page titled “Justice for Harambe” had more than 3,000 likes by Sunday afternoon, a day after the 400-pound (181-kg) gorilla was shot dead about 10 minutes after encountering and dragging the child.

The animal, named Harambe, was a Western lowland gorilla, an endangered species, and the zoo said it had intended to use him for breeding.

“If we think it’s acceptable to kill a gorilla who has done nothing wrong, I don’t think our city should have gorillas,” Manvinder Singh posted on the Facebook page.

A blog post on the website for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals questioned why it was necessary to kill the gorilla and whether zoos could meet the needs of such animals.

“A 17-year-old gorilla named Harambe is dead, and a child is in the hospital. Why?” blogger Jennifer O’Connor wrote. “Western lowland gorillas are gentle animals. They don’t attack unless they’re provoked.”

Witnesses told local television that the boy repeatedly expressed a desire to join the gorilla in the zoo habitat. Moments later, the boy crawled through a barrier and fell about 12 feet (3.7-meters) into a moat surrounding the habitat, where Harambe grabbed him, zoo officials said.

It was the first time in the 38-year history of the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden’s gorilla exhibit that an unauthorized person was able to get into the enclosure, zoo president Thane Maynard said on Saturday.

“They made a tough choice and they made the right choice because they saved that little boy’s life,” he said, adding that a member of the zoo’s Dangerous Animal Response Team fired the shot that killed the ape.

Maynard said the team decided to use deadly force instead of tranquilizers to subdue the gorilla because it could have taken some time for the drug to take effect when an animal was in agitated state.

The child was taken to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center for treatment of non-life threatening injuries. Hospital officials, citing privacy laws, declined to say on Sunday whether the child had been released or to disclose any details about his injuries.

Western lowland gorilla numbers in the dense rain forests of Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Equatorial Guinea have declined by more than 60 percent over the last 20 to 25 years, according to the World Wildlife Federation.

The Cincinnati zoo was open on Sunday, although Gorilla World was expected to be closed indefinitely. Neither the zoo nor the fire department responded to a request for comment.

At other US zoos, similar encounters have ended in tragedy, including the 2013 fatal mauling of a 2-year-old boy by a pack of wild African dogs after he fell into an exhibit at the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium.

A man who in 2012 jumped into an enclosure at New York’s Bronx Zoo to be “one with the tiger” suffered bite wounds and other injuries but survived.

But there was a happy ending when a 3-year-old boy fell into the gorilla den at Brookfield Zoo near Chicago in 1996, and an 8-year-old female gorilla named Binti Jua picked up the unconscious boy and protected him from the other primates. The act of kindness won Binti Jua national attention as Newsweek’s Hero of the Year and one of People’s most intriguing people.",[],"Share:Ohio-The killing of a gorilla at the Cincinnati Zoo after a 4-year-old boy tumbled into the ape’s enclosure triggered outrage and questions about safety, but zoo officials called the decision to use lethal force a tough but necessary choice.

According to a recent technical note titled, ‘Protection of Children During the Coronavirus Pandemic’ by the Alliance for Child Protection in Humanitarian Crisis, children are now at greater risk of child abuse and neglect as they spend most of their time inside their homes under fear, stress and uncertainty. The measures taken to combat the recent corona pandemic including school closure and restricted activity of the entire family has increased stressors amongst parents. While children struggle with their routine and parental expectations, parents worry about parenting on top of job insecurity and making ends meet. Even though it is commonly believed that children are completely safe at home, parents and family members pose a greater risk for violence as the dynamic of trust, power and control interplay.

The corona pandemic has psycho-social impact on the child including child abuse and neglect, mental health issues with increased feeling of helplessness, isolation, fear and anxiety. Other risks include domestic/interpersonal violence, gender-based violence due to gender-imposed roles, child labour due to increased economic demand on the family, separation, unaccompanied children and social exclusion. Special children including those with disabilities, behavioural problems including attention deficit, hyperactive disorder or those who have psycho-social difficulties such as children living in poverty, slums, institutional care or the streets are at a much higher risk of abuse and neglect during this time.

Currently, most of the government’s efforts are to control the spread of the infection and provide relief and recovery of those affected by corona pandemic. The relief package introduced for daily wagers and the underprivileged would help decrease stress on parents, indirectly decreasing violence on children and women. However, it is important to understand that children should also be a key priority during the COVID-19 response. The Minimum Standards for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action, 2019 which is a key resource for humanitarian workers alongside the technical note mentioned above, suggests that advocacy with the government, child-protection specific programming and collaboration is vital for protecting children, especially in such special circumstances.

Unfortunately, in Pakistan the child protection system where prevention and management of child abuse cases is done in a systematic, multisectoral way is already missing. Our professionals such as doctors, teachers, social workers and law enforcers are not trained to detect cases and inter and intra departmental collaborations are not in place to manage children in a holistic way.

This already inadequate system for protecting children needs to be ready for the challenge of an increase in child abuse and neglect with decreased identification and reporting. The authorities need to take substantial steps to incorporate protecting children as a part of their response to fighting COVID-19. As parents and children are over exposed to news on digital and social media, with emphasis on fake news, myths and political talk shows along with the constant updates on number of cases and deaths due to the epidemic, the mental health of parents and children is deteriorating. Just like the awareness campaign about social distancing and handwashing, the government needs to start a mass awareness campaign on information dissemination about mental health, self-care, parenting and engaging children in healthy and creative activities during the lockdown and the corona pandemic. Efforts should also emphasise reducing social exclusion and stigma due to the disease and ways in which children with special needs can be protected from further discrimination. All Pakistani channels, including news channels should be obligated to not only spread this information as public service messages but also dedicate a time slot for child programmes. Social media and digital solutions should also be used to disseminate this information.

According to the international guidelines provided by the Alliance, collaboration and coordination across sectors and governments is essential. Clear standards of care, procedures for documentation and referrals and training of professionals dealing with children about child protection measures during a humanitarian crisis need to be addressed. Clear protocols and mechanisms to ensure the safety of the child in case the parent/caregiver is taken away for treatment or the child is separated from the family need to be established.

Child protection specific programmes need to be introduced in which children, adolescents and parents are meaningfully engaged to understand how the lockdown and COVID-19 has affected their lives. These programmes should focus on designing individual and group activities for the wellbeing of children and families, strengthening families and their environment, involving and engaging communities to spread awareness and identifying strategies for vulnerable groups of children, improving case management systems especially in hospital settings and improving systems of alternative care for children especially those who are unsafe in their own homes.

While most of the efforts are directed towards survival, issues such as child protection and development need to be addressed immediately. Before this becomes an after-thought of a disaster, the government and the authorities need to act fast to fight the short and long-term effects of this pandemic on children.",['Mehek Naeem'],"The measures taken to combat the recent corona pandemic including school closure and restricted activity of the entire family has increased stressors amongst parents.

SIALKOT - Retreating from its earlier claim that the Christian girl, whose body was found in a canal here two weeks ago, had committed suicide, the police have finally registered a murder case after the two weeks of the incident.

Police have registered the case on the report of Tania Mariyam’s brother Johnson Gill under section 302 PPC. Earlier, the Sambrial police had said that the girl had committed suicide by jumping into the Upper Chenab Canal (UCC) near Sambrial on January 23, 2017.

According to the FIR, Johnson had dropped his 12-year-old sister at her school namely Convent of Jesus and Mary School Sialkot Cantt. Later, he received a phone call that her dead body was found from the Upper Chenab Canal (UCC) near Sambrial, as the police had claimed the student of 6th class committed suicide by jumping into the canal.

Now, the police have registered the murder case following the mounted pressure by the local protesting Christian community in this regard. The grieved family submitted a petition in the court for the exhumation of the grave to find out a clue about her mysterious murder.

Judicial magistrate Shagufta Sabir had summoned the police with complete record for February 06. Her father Nadeem Gill told newsmen that the police still remain unable to find out any clue to resolve the mystery. He alleged that his daughter was murdered by some unknown persons while the police said that she committed suicide.

He urged the police to bring the management of Convent of Jesus and Mary Sialkot Cantt under investigation. He also alleged that the police were adopting delaying tactics in providing justice. He feared that his daughters was kidnapped and killed by some unknown accused from her school and later they killed her and threw her body into the canal.

Haroon Janjua

Islamabad - The recent burning of a teenage girl by her own mother in the name of honour has triggered the debate on so-called honour killings in the country.

Last week in the country’s eastern city of Lahore, an 18-year-old Zeenat Rafiq was drenched with kerosene oil and set on fire because the girl had challenged the social norms by marrying a man of her own choice.

The case stirred the countrywide anger among the civil society and human rights activists but such killings are common in Pakistan.

Lahore’s Zeenat Rafiq is the most recent case in the series of such occurrences in recent months. However, recently, in the hilly town of Murree a 21-year-old schoolteacher Maria Bibi was set ablaze for refusing to marry a man twice of her age. Later, she succumbed to her injuries at PIMS, Islamabad, on May 31.

Earlier in May, a 16-year-old girl Ambreen was strangled and set on fire in Abbottabad, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, after the decision given by the local jirga.

Jirgas and customary laws run parallel with the democratic constitution of the country in resolving local disputes. Ambreen was punished for helping her school friend to elope with her lover.

In Pakistan, the victims have been killed by relatives for getting raped, being homosexual, committing adultery and actions that bring shame or dishonour to the family.

“There has been an increase in the honour killing cases in various parts of the country. Media and police records show the sudden rise in such crimes, which is a discouraging element for the society,” says Tahira Abdullah, human rights activist.

Simultaneously, she told The Nation that Pakistan is becoming highly polarised society with moderate powers giving ground and fundamentalist radical forces having a broader say in determining the country’s laws and politics.

Various critics view that the bill against honour killings was passed in 2004 but it has hitherto been badly followed.

Moreover, human rights activists view that even with the sounder implementation, the law itself is not adequate enough to preclude such practices. “Legislation cannot do practically enough until there is a positive change and development in social positioning of the women,” Dr Farzana Bari, an Islamabad-based women rights activist told The Nation.

However, there is an urgent requirement for fortifying the current law against honour killings, Bari stressed, indicating that at present most the such cases are not been followed up in court. This resulted in the rise of such crimes being committed with impunity, she believes.

Samar Minullah, a social activist and filmmaker suggested, “The state has to become defender of victims of honour killings and ensure rigorous punishment for the culprits.”

Minullah also blamed the country’s mainstream media of partially strengthening anti-women social approaches by portraying women as subservient entities in television transmissions and serials. However, she also criticised the media in reporting such incidents, saying: “Media to a greater extent recklessly glorifies the killers in such cases.”

However, the situation ignites when the Pakistan’s top clerical body, Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), has taken controversial stances in recent months, saying that a husband should be allowed to “lightly beat” his wife, besides declaring a women’s protection legislation “un-Islamic.”

Rights activists asked if the CII or any other religious body, whatsoever, has ever come forward and condemned crimes committed against women in this country.

Activists accept that it is not easy to change societal behaviour towards women in Pakistan. They are committed with the cause and vow to carry on their efforts to eradicate such anti-women practices from the society.

The HRCP complainant cell head, Zaman Khan denounced the government on the issue. The government has not appointed a chairperson for the National Commission on Status of Women for the past six months – one of the major governmental bodies regarding women rights.

In February, when filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy won the Oscar ward on her short documentary “A girl in the river,” various activists and campaigners in Pakistan took heart from the Sharmeen’s award which pressed for the stronger legislations to protect potential victims. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is committed to bring forth the stronger legislation on honour killing and give women their due rights for achieving the shared goal of prosperous and vibrant Pakistan.",[],"Share:Haroon JanjuaIslamabad - The recent burning of a teenage girl by her own mother in the name of honour has triggered the debate on so-called honour killings in the country.

There is a vast difference between Pakistani and American societies in nearly all walks of life. However, we can find some commonalities as human nature remains the same, in terms of reacting over situations, quest for knowledge and desire to know more about the world and beyond. These human traits are found in every society irrespective of their nature of socio-economic and political structures. For ten days in July of this year, as a team leader of a project titled “Assimilation Challenges of Pakistani Diaspora in United States” under “GLCA-Library of Congress Faculty-Student Research Program”, I visited Library of Congress (LOC), in Washington D.C. Apart from understanding the research techniques required to utilise the rich resources available in various sections of the library, my intention was to compare and contrast the social behaviours and academic environment of the host and home countries. When I first entered the building of LOC, I was not only thrilled by the artistic interior but also excited by its mesmerising academic environment. My first encounter there was with the library staff, who guided me through various stages of attaining the membership. I was delighted to see fresh and joyful faces at the information desk of Jefferson building (one of the three buildings). The feature which inspired me most during my first interaction was the gender balance of the staff. The senior female staff members were well-versed in their assigned task and professionally dealt with the responsibilities of the job. I instantly compared this with an average old woman of my country, who with advancement of age lacks energy, either because of unattended diseases at early stage or malnutrition. Another reason of their non-participatory role outside home is that the socio-cultural set-up of our society emphasises that a senior female citizen should only perform religious rituals, confining their activities within the house hold chores.

During first two days, I spent most of the time in the Asian Reading room as my research was on Pakistani community living in the United States. However, while finding the material from LOC Online Catalogue, I noticed that the library was well-equipped with vast material on different topics in various languages. Interestingly only about 5% of the LOC’s complete holdings are in digital form. Before arriving at LOC, I was informed that the vast nature of resources at library often distract the researcher from their focus. Conscious of the fact, I prepared a detailed research manual of my topic and communicated in advance with the assigned librarian, which helped me to organize my search at different sections of the library. At the same time, my objective was to even visit those collections of the library, which might not have been directly useful for my chosen area of research. Therefore, I planned my 9 days of research to explore those sections in Jefferson and Madison building, which were helpful for my research. Apart from scanning 37 requested books on my topic in the main reading hall of LOC, I spent time in three main reading rooms; Newspapers and Periodicals section, Prints and Photographs division and Motion Pictures & Television section. Although, there are 24 reading rooms in Jefferson, Madison and Adams buildings of LOC, the reason to select these sections after the tutorial by LOC staff was the unique nature of on-site accessible resources of these reading rooms. Each section has numerous online databases, which a researcher can select from as per the nature of the study. After discussing the topic with the librarian, I was able to search and download the material from the relevant databases of mentioned sections, which were otherwise inaccessible off-site.

The books which directly dealt with my research topic were, “Portrait of a giving Community: Philanthropy by the Pakistani-American Diaspora”, “ Pakistanis in Michigan: A Study of Third Culture and Acculturation” and “Geographies of Muslim Identities: Diaspora, Gender and Belonging”. In Motion Pictures and Television section, I found a drama “Green Card”, broadcasted on Pakistan Television in 1991. It was about an American woman, married to a Pakistani man but because of huge cultural differences between the two societies, she faced a lot of difficulties. Another interesting documentary, which inspired me was “ Point of Attack”, based on post 9/11 conditions of Pakistani immigrants in United States. In Newspapers and Periodicals section, the most interesting on-site database was “Pro-Quest Historical Newspapers”, which helped me to find out the related news, articles, and editorials from 2001 to 2010.

To me, my visit to Washington, D.C in United States was both, social and academic. On one side, it provided me an opportunity to use vast resources of LOC, while on the other it enabled me to visit significant nearby places. Another thing which inspired me most was the behaviour this developed nation has towards life. Women with their toddlers were on the streets crossing the roads, with ease. Pregnant women were walking freely and without fear of being hit and harassed in all kinds of dresses. As a researcher on women rights, I immediately compared them with the women of my country. In my country, once a woman is pregnant, she is treated differently. If I say “abnormally”, then it will not be wrong either. Every member of the family reinforces that a pregnant woman’s mobility should be restricted. For a mother of a toddler, even for educated and professional women, going overseas for professional and academic pursuits is usually out of the question. If they succeed to break these stereotypes, even then they are tagged with labels like “selfish” and social structures pose a stiff hindrance to her independent postures.

Concluding my fruitful experience at LOC, I will say that as a researcher, apart from enhancing my horizon of learning, this visit enabled me to compare and contrast the facilities as well as attitudes of the two divergent societies. After this exposure, as a social scientist, I am convinced that my countrymen have the capability to come at par with international academic standards once they become aware of modern techniques and approaches as adopted by the developed countries like the United States.",['Dr Zamurrad Awan'],"Share:There is a vast difference between Pakistani and American societies in nearly all walks of life.

https://nation.com.pk/09-Apr-2017/stricter-child-abuse-punishments,2017-04-08 23:34:35+05:00,Stricter Child Abuse Punishments,"Share:

The National Assembly Sub-committee on Interior rejected the The Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill 2016 on Friday. The changes, recommended after the incidents of child sexual abuse and pornography in Swat and Kasur were exposed, suggested increasing the punishment for statutory rape and child pornography. The committee however, rejected the proposed changes, and the convener – Naeema Kishwar Khan of JUI-F – even went as far as stating that there was no need because a punishment (five to seven years’ imprisonment) already existed and that it was “not rape.”

It is shocking that a sitting Member of the National Assembly does not see statutory rape – sexual assault on a minor – as equivalent to rape; in the eyes of international law, it is generally the same thing. But then maybe, this should not be much of a surprise, considering that the Hudood Ordinances essentially abolished Pakistan’s statutory rape law. Girls as young as twelve have been prosecuted for extra-marital intercourse, where previously, this would have mandated statutory rape charges against the assailant. This is why the problem of child sexual abuse is so rampant in the country.

Consent as a concept is also something that many lawmakers do not understand and the law does not acknowledge since sex outside of marriage is illegal. A minor cannot give their consent for any decision considered in the adult domain – if children cannot consent to participating in sexual intercourse or pornography, the cases in Swat and Kasur are to be considered rape, and Ms Khan of JUI-F should revise her definition.

There are very few crimes that should warrant the ultimate punishments – the death penalty or life imprisonment – and apart from murder, rape is one such crime. Statutory rape is no different from rape and hence all those guilty of those should suffer the same punishment.

Abhorrent as the cases in Kasur, Swat and all other cases of child sexual abuse are, the harrowing reports emerging on this topic at least initiated the discussion on what was to be done. But none of that has resulted into action against this horrendous crime; there are reports that the victims are having trouble resuming life normally, while their attackers roam free and lawmakers in our parliament consider these crimes against innocent children as something less serious than rape.

The government must take action; the bill tabled by Mussarrat Ahmed Zeb, was suggested because the number of crimes of child sexual abuse tell us that the punishment is not acting as enough of a deterrent. One can only hope that others in parliament get their act together to protect Pakistan’s children.",[],"The changes, recommended after the incidents of child sexual abuse and pornography in Swat and Kasur were exposed, suggested increasing the punishment for statutory rape and child pornography.

https://nation.com.pk/16-Dec-2017/fear-shame-preserve-silence-of-abuse-by-clerics-in-pakistan,2017-12-16 18:35:00+05:00,"Fear, shame preserve silence of abuse by clerics in Pakistan","Share:

It began with sweets and pocket money when he was 10 years old — special attention from the religious cleric who ran a madrassa, or Islamic school, the boy attended.

And it escalated to rape and months of sexual abuse, the now 28-year-old young man says.

“I feel rage now when I think after he raped me he took a bath and right away he left to lead the prayers,” the man, an economist who lives in Islamabad, told The Associated Press. “After that I came to know from three or four of my classmates that the mufti used to do the same with them.”

Speaking English, at times searching for the right words and at others apologising for the explicitness of his conversation, he described the cleric’s advances: how he took him to another mosque that was not associated with the madrassa the boy attended and then raped him.

He said he suppressed memories of the abuse for years, but after reading an AP report last month revealing widespread abuse by clerics in Pakistan’s thousands of madrassas, they all came tumbling back.

“I read the story two times. The first time I was shocked. The things that were written there were everything I had lived. The second time I read it, the whole of my body was trembling because of the memories it brought back,” said the man, speaking on condition of anonymity, not only because of the shame he felt nearly two decades later but because he feared Pakistan’s religious leaders could retaliate against him either with violence or charges of blasphemy or being an apostate, both of which, he said, were tantamount to a death sentence.

He decided to approach his former classmates, to rally survivors of abuse to band together to speak out. But, he said, he was rebuffed, and firmly.

“They said ‘Stop talking. This is not something to discuss.’ It is so common in the madrassas here, but people don’t want to talk about it. We are ashamed,” the young man said.

There are more than 22,000 registered madrassas in Pakistan, and many thousands of unregistered ones, often grimy one- or two-room facilities in remote villages. The millions of students they teach are often among the country’s poorest, who receive food and an education for free.

But at the madrassa this young man attended — one of the largest in the Pakistani capital, which attracted students from other parts of the country — many of his fellow students were, like himself, from middle- and upper-middle class families, “sent to the madrassa to win favor for the family from God,” he said.

Naeema Kishwar, a federal lawmaker who last year helped change Pakistan’s laws to close a legal loophole that had allowed those who commit so-called “honor killings” to escape punishment, said that laws exist to tackle sexual abuse of minors, which she called a scourge in Pakistan, not only in madrassas but in public schools, at home and among the army of child workers who are employed in homes as domestic workers and in factories.

“Of course, it is the responsibility of the federal government to prevent abuse of children, but you must keep it in your mind that provincial governments are equally to be blamed for being unable to stop child abuse at all places, including private and government schools and madrassas,” she said. “This is a common problem.”

But Kishwar who is a member of the religious Jamaat-e-Ulema-e-Islam, a pro-Taliban party, took umbrage with a focus on sexual abuse in the madrassas. Her party operates thousands of religious schools. But like the clerics who dominate her party, Kishwar, despite data and evidence to the contrary, said the incidents of abuses in religious seminaries were isolated.

Taha Siddiqui, a prominent Pakistani blogger and journalist, who has come under attack by the military and intelligence agencies in Pakistan for his outspoken commentaries, said the AP report was widely shared on social media, whereas the mainstream media stayed mostly silent. He blamed fear among the mainstream media of antagonizing the country’s religious leaders and because sex, even if it involves abuse, is a taboo subject.

“Such topics rarely get any coverage on national television channels. And for that reason, there were discussions on social media which were much more encouraging,” he said.

Two-time Oscar winner Sharmeen Obaid, whose documentaries have given a voice to victims of acid attacks and “honor killings” in Pakistan, retweeted the story.

Sherry Rahman, a senator in Pakistan’s upper house of Parliament and a close ally of Pakistan’s slain leader, Benazir Bhutto, tweeted: “This is a subject we need to talk about so our children are better protected. Sexual abuse of children is pervasive at many levels of society across the class divide. We must give courage and hope for victims to speak out. ”

Raza Rumi, a Pakistani journalist and policy analyst, who moved to the United States after surviving an assassination attempt by members of the militant Lashkar-e-Janghvi group, tweeted: “This had to be said. For too long we have avoided confronting such brutalities. . . End #child #abuse in #Pakistan.”

But there were also virulent attacks, said Siddiqui. Some accused those who criticized madrassas of blasphemy, while others said it was a Western conspiracy to defame Islam.

Unfortunately, another similar case has appeared, namely that of Marwah, a five-year-old girl kidnapped, raped and murdered in Essa Nagri area of the port city, Karachi. The autopsies revealed that she was raped and the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head before her body was torched in the garbage.

It is sad to see the justice system of Pakistan allows culprits to commit such heinous acts across the country. Every single government department can be blamed for such incidents since they don’t take any of these cases seriously.

The policy dialogue organized by AAWAZ Voice and Accountability Programme was held at a local hotel in Bhurban, said a press release. The participants agreed to develop the national policy in consultation with the relevant stakeholders through dialogue at provincial and local level. The proposed policy framework included a vision statement on safe spaces for women and girls, relevant legislation, institutional and response mechanisms and rehabilitation of survivors of violence against women in a dignified manner.

It also included a major awareness raising at all levels on the issues of violence against women and capacity building of police and judicial officers. It was also said that media, education, creative arts, schools and madaris as well as other social and political institutions should be involved for creating enabling environment for the success of the policy.

The crucial significance of law enforcement agencies such as police and lower judiciary in curbing gender-based violence was highlighted. The participants also suggested that a one-stop approach is required to address the issue, where medico-legal, police help, shelter home and rehabilitation facilities are put under one roof. Murtaza Javed Abbasi, Deputy Speaker, National Assembly, in his remarks as chief guest, emphasized that civil society organizations must take political parties along in their struggle for gender equality.

If the political leaders are aware of the problems, they will strive to resolve those in the constituencies.

The participants expressed deep concern over the increasing incidents of violence against women with the alarming scale and intensity.

Balochistan is the province which has been facing many problems since decades. Among all those issues, honour killing is one of the biggest issues in Balochistan. Honour killing is an act of violence, especially a murder of female genders by a male dominated society.

A recent report by the Aurat Foundation a non-governmental Organization working in the province Balochistan mentions the protection of women rights that some 50 people of which 30 women were murdered by their relatives and family members by the name of so-called honour. Such cases are mostly found in the Nasirabad division and Bolan district. More then 10 people were secently killed in Bolan district in the name of honous. Not only Baloch society facing the problem of honour killing but also different societies in the country involve in the issue of honour killing.

Some reports show that around 1,000 women are killed annually in Pakistan by the name of honour killings for allegedly violating social norms and marriages and some honour cases remain unreported still. No doubt, honour killing is a very common issue in the world, particularly under-developed countries like Bangaldash, India and Pakistan.

Although, the government recently passed a bill against such violent activities but the implimentation of law remained a dream in the country including the province Balochistan. I request the government of Balochistan to take some strong steps to control the honour killing in Balochistan.

The New York Times revealed sexual assault accusations on Academy Award winner Harvey Weinstein in a sensational article. However, it has shed light on the much deeper issue of ‘the casting couch’ in Hollywood. This document analyses the origins of this culture and the role of the ideological state apparatus in normalising this behaviour.

More than 50 women have made allegations against Harvey Weinstein and the number continues to grow each day. Among the Hollywood mogul’s accusers are household names who were still looking to establish themselves when the alleged offences took place. Subsequently, he was fired from his company Weinstein Co, however; this doesn’t counter the tradition of abuse that has become a norm within Hollywood.

The first incident of sexual assault by powerful producer dates back to 1921 when Roscoe’ fatty’ Arbuckle raped Virginia Rappe at a party. The injuries were so severe that she died a few days later. Hollywood, however, performed its first cover-up and blamed her injuries on backstreet abortions. Shirley Temple recalled that Arthur Freed, a producer at MGM, exposed himself to her when she was 12 years old. Marilyn Monroe compared Hollywood to an “overcrowded brothel”. The vastly disproportionate power dynamics between men and women weren’t a coincidence though; they were the result of years of weeding out strong women and normalising sexism.

As the film business settled in a Californian orange grove, thousands of young American women made their way to Hollywood hoping to become stars. Cinema had become a vastly lucrative business, but it was star names, not studio brands that sold tickets. In the 1920s, as actress Louise Brooks describes it, when the producers realised that female stars were a threat to their dominance, they waged “a concerted war on the star system”, and abusing the power they had to make or break an actor’s career. Female writers and producers such as Frances Marion and June Mathis, who had held senior positions in the silent-era industry, were squeezed out by the '30s, and soon the business was being run by a group of male executives, many of whom obsessively controlled the films they produced and the women who starred in them. Once a woman became a star her identity was in the hands of these producers, they created and destroyed actresses as they liked. The star was a creation of the executive’s imagination, and his corporate asset, to be discarded as soon as she was tagged “box-office poison”.

The degree of control granted to producers led way to the casting couch culture. The casting couch is used in reference to the supposed practice whereby actresses are awarded parts in films or plays in return for granting sexual favours to the casting director. Foster Hirsch, author of The Boys From Syracuse: The Shuberts’ Theatrical Empire, details how Lee Shubert, the eldest of three brothers who helped establish Broadway’s theatre district in the first two decades of the 20th century, kept “an elegantly furnished boudoir, reserved for leading ladies and promising ingénues, and a shabby, spartanly furnished room with a single couch where he met chorus girls and soubrettes”. one of those dancers, Agnes de Mille, recalled about the Shubert brothers, “If you didn’t sleep with them you didn’t get the part. The Shuberts ran a brothel: Let them sue me.” The practice goes back to the early 1960s when Joan Collins claimed that she lost the lead in Joseph L Mickiewicz’s epic Cleopatra after the studio’s top dog explained that the price for such an illustrious part was sex. The extent of the problem is clearly highlighted when even the biggest female stars like Angelina Jolie are not exempted. It proves that this issue has its roots in a much deeper sociological idea. Icelandic singer Bjork recalls that when she worked with a “Danish director” her “humiliation and role as a lesser sexually harassed being was the norm … it is a universal thing that a director can touch and harass his actresses at will and the institution of film allows it”. Why is it considered normal for powerful men to harass women in the industry? The answer lies in Althusser's theory of the ideological state apparatus.

In Althusser’s view, these ideological apparatuses can properly be described as belonging to the state, even if they appear formally separate from it. He argues that the state actually has two components: a repressive state apparatus, which includes the army, the police, and the courts, and enforces class domination directly, and the ideological state apparatuses (ISA), which maintains complicity and identification with class society. There are two ways to reproduce class structure: controlling the means of production and ideological control. The means of production isolates the proletariat from economic freedom and the ISA legitimises this isolation. The ISA is established through media control. The ownership of media majorly belongs to the elite class that can influence the media content to enforce class structures and submission to the bourgeoisie. They manipulate the media content to reinstate the class hierarchy in the minds of the masses. The ISA puts certain values in focus to instill them in the minds of the masses, so that it is easier to control them. ISA stresses obedience and acceptance of the ruling class as superior. It propagates the idea the isolation from the means of production is justified. Instead they way to success are through obedience of the capitalists and an acceptance of the system. Thereby, delaying class consciousness because the masses start accepts their exploitation as a norm.

The situation in Hollywood works on the same Marxist principles. The bourgeoisie are the producers who exploit the proletariat i.e. actors. In a male dominated industry, the power was held by a few production houses where women had two choices: accept their advances or sacrifice their career. It is an unfair choice to present but then again the balance of power within the industry is unfair. Over time power shifted from production houses to directors, which, not so surprisingly, were also male. This embedded the idea of the 'casting couch' within the members of Hollywood; it became something whose existence cannot be denied. The idea of a casting couch was institutionalised by the ideological state apparatus because it championed values such as obedience and acceptance of the social structure. It advocates submission to those who control the means of production and that they have a right to exploit their workers. In this sense, directors where seen as landowners or factory owners were seen in the past, granting them ample access to exploit these actresses. Since most new actresses are mostly from the middle class looking to have a chance at stardom, they mirror a proletariat hungry for a job. This establishes hierarchy let him abuse women without consequences. The ISA then legitimises these actions by imbedding into people’s minds that this behaviour is simply something to be expected of the elite. That it normal, almost like a rite of passage, for young women to submit to the casting couch, because they must listen to the producers.

Additionally, Marxist feminist theory of double jeopardy applies here as well. Women suffer because of both sexism and capitalism. They are first exploited for labour by the capitalist society, as most of these aspiring actresses belong to the middle class. On top of that, they are exploited by men in the industry because of their gender. The historical context proves that this is something that has been going on since the inception of Hollywood but just wasn't questioned till now. The most plausible reason for this is the ideological state apparatus theory. If Althrusser’s thesis is correct, it is indeed the ideological control perpetuated by the media itself that legitimises sexual advances by powerful men. Women are conditioned into believing this behaviour is okay by two sources: men and the bourgeoisie. In Hollywood, the rich and powerful are inherently men. Ninety six per cent of the directors of last year’s top grossing films were men. For example, Weinstein was allowed to operate like this, and for so long, because the industry has been all-too-comfortable with the very notion of the casting couch. Several prominent actors and directors like Woody Allen, Kevin Spacey, Robert de Niro, Bill Cosby, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon of all have been accused of sexual harassment. Infect, Bill Cosby’s defence on the matter was: ""Even if proven (and it could not be), the age-old ‘casting couch’ is not unique to Mr Cosby, and thus not a ‘signature’ nor a basis for the admissibility of these witnesses’ stories, let alone a conviction.""

This exploitation is especially prominent in Hollywood because of its unique atmosphere. In the media, there is no tangible good produced by actors, rather it’s the actors persona that is to be up for sale. Controversial as it may be, this makes it very easy for men to blur the lines between work and sexual exploitation. Hollywood was once described as ""a town where everyone is selling body and soul for fame and fortune and all – especially women – are considered commodities"" by Peter Keough in 1995. In many instances, directors and producers have demanded women to perform sexual acts in an audition. Helen Mire said she was forced to show off her body for director Michael Winner while seeking a role in one of his projects in 1964. Cara Delavigne came forward, alleging Weinstein had sexually harassed her when she first started work as an actress. He had urged her to kiss another woman, she claimed, before trying to kiss her himself. However, the ISA does not exist in vacuum. The ISA was enhanced by the averment present in Hollywood. Rampant elitist culture also legitimised inappropriate behaviour; new girls were simply expected to put up with whatever well established directors did.

On top of that, proper mechanisms exist to dismiss complaints. Harvey Weinstein reached more than six settlements with the victims. The silencing mechanism is very robust; if you speak out we'll ruin your career. In part, the victims feel trapped. They feel powerless against the abuser who could end their career or smear their name – and makes open threats to do so. The ‘you’ll never work in this town again’. Actress Ashley Judd says that at the time of the incident she thought, ""How do I get out of the room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein?""

This predatory behaviour is propagated by two forces: acceptance and fear. Acceptance of the fact that this is how the world - and the industry- works. That producers and directors can exploit their power over you and you just have to roll with it. Fear works to silence you, because you don’t want your career to end or become the next Patricia Douglas. The ISA is to blame for both of these sentiments. First, it has made us accept exploitation of workers as a norm and second, it has made protest illegitimate. Obedience requires us to remain silent if our rights are inflicted, thus speaking out no longer remains an option. This is proven by the fact that it took three decades and over 50 women to finally speak out against Harvey Weinstein. We need to recognise the stimulus of our behavior if we are to rectify it. We have been secretly enrolled in the working class mentality by our media. The ISA has conditioned us to accept exploitation of ourselves and our peers as a norm, and Hollywood is no exception. The very idea of the ‘casting couch’ is a testament to that.",['Manaal Ahmed'],"However, it has shed light on the much deeper issue of ‘the casting couch’ in Hollywood.

What a beautiful child molester, if only I was a child. This note is not a direct attack on HumTv, their award ceremony, or on Yasir Hussain’s comment, following Ahsan Khan’s win in the Best Actor category for drama serial ‘Udaari’.

It merely seeks to question the obvious. When will we, as a nation, remove the taboo surrounding the issue of child abuse, and work collectively to eradicate it? It is you and I, members of this community, that are wholly to blame. Our insensitivity and immaturity towards firstly, recognising one of the biggest issues of our country, and secondly, unifying to address the issue itself, has led us to our current state. When it comes to child sexual abuse in Pakistan, we are either silent, apathetic or ignorant.

‘Udaari’ created a lot of awareness by highlighting the issue of child molestation. The serial shed some much needed light on the area, and subtly urged it’s viewers to speak out, and act against it. Udaari took a bold step by drawing attention to a step-father’s abuse of a child in a rural village. The show met with a lot of resistance and was even issued a notice by the Pemra (Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority) for containing inappropriate content and an immoral story line.

However, it’s efforts now seem to be all but in vain. In a report published by Sahil, a non-governmental organisation, 4,139 cases of child sexual abuse were registered in 2016. This figure itself showed an increase of 10 percent from the previous year. Around 51 percent of these registered cases belonged to the age group of 0-15 years. In the same year, Sahil recorded 176 cases of reported child marriages.

According to the same report, abusers were shown to “trap children by showing love, offering gifts, eventually relating it to a favour”. The significance of this definition is that children are mostly abused at the hands of their acquaintances. It is very easy to convince a vulnerable and young mind that the act being performed on them is not to be perceived as inappropriate or wrong. Statements such as the one in question, have the same effect on these minds, convincing them that it is not out of the ordinary to be treated in this manner.

The problem lies at a grass root level. A failure to recognise the topic as a prevalent horror in our society has only contributed to the ever growing number of child sexual abuse cases in Pakistan. In order to curb the problem and stop it from getting out of hand, various steps need to be taken in a timely manner.

Social, cultural, and domestic norms have often delayed the access of justice in similar cases. Child abuse cases are rarely reported, often due to the high stigma attached to it. Children need to be educated regarding their personal rights to their bodies at a pre-mature stage. In doing so, there is a great role that parents and guardians need to play, to assist them in comprehending the issues at hand.

A legal insight it the subject shows us that there are no explicitly formulated, specialised laws for the prevention of child sexual abuse in Pakistan. According to SPARC, another non-governmental organisation, child sexual abuse is recognised as a form of violence in the Pakistan Penal Code 1860, and as an act of terrorism by the Anti Terrorism Act 1997. Nevertheless, there is still a need for specialised laws on the area, seeking to define the crime, set it’s ambit, and to specify what constitutes it.

Celebrities, by nature of their public standing and influence, bear a greater burden in ensuring that statements they make on public forums are politically correct. Though as humans, we are all bound to make mistakes in life. As long as we realise and understand these mistakes, we should be forgiven for them. At the same time, further care should be taken to ensure that such careless remarks are not mimicked or repeated in the future to minimise the risk of any adverse implications of them.",['Hassan Farhan Bokhari'],"When will we, as a nation, remove the taboo surrounding the issue of child abuse, and work collectively to eradicate it?

LAHORE: An Anti-Terrorism Court last year convicted two suspects and ordered release of four others in the largest child sexual abuse case that took place in Kasur first time ever in the country's history in 2015.

Ghanda Singh Wala police, Kasur, lodged 19 FIRs against 25 persons allegedly involved in torturing and abusing children in Kasur district.

The court also imposed fine of Rs. 0.3 million on the convicts for their role in abusing children. Haseem was the member of a prominent family in Kasur and Majeed was his friend.

The proceedings continued for more than two years and the majority suspects were freed owing to weak evidence and proofs of their involvement.

https://nation.com.pk/22-Sep-2018/trump-turns-on-supreme-court-nominees-accuser,2018-09-22 08:33:00+05:00,Trump turns on Supreme Court nominee's accuser,"Share:

The woman whose sexual assault allegation threatens to bring down Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee rejected an ultimatum Friday for testifying in the Senate after the US president turned against her, claiming her accusation could not be true.

The increasingly ugly fight over the fate of Trump's bid to put conservative judge Brett Kavanaugh into the lifetime position on the Supreme Court appeared to be nearing its end game, though still with no clarity on whether the woman at the center of the row will testify.

Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor who says Kavanaugh carried out a violent sexual assault against her when he was 17 and she was 15, insists she is ready to testify under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

However, she rejected a deadline of late Friday imposed by the committee's Republican leader to agree to his terms for the hearing, which he said should take place next Wednesday.

If she didn't agree, committee chairman Charles Grassley said, he would go ahead and schedule a vote on confirming Kavanaugh on Monday, but without her testimony.

A statement by Ford's lawyers carried by CNN asked for one more day to respond, calling the deadline ""arbitrary.""

""Its sole purpose is to bully Dr. Ford and deprive her of the ability to make a considered decision.... Our modest request is that she be given an additional day to make her decision.""

Ford has said she wants to testify Thursday at the earliest and to be able to call as a witness a man who she says was present during the assault, when they were all teenagers attending private schools near Washington, DC.

The committee's Republican leadership has turned down those demands. But there was no immediate response from the Republicans to Ford's latest message asking for extra time.

Presidential pressure

After several days of maintaining a relatively neutral posture, Trump took off the gloves Friday to declare that Ford could not be believed.

The aggressive posture reflected Trump's fear that time is running out to get his hand-picked judge confirmed -- thereby tilting the Supreme Court firmly to the right for years to come -- before November elections when Republicans risk losing control of Congress.

""TAKE THE VOTE!"" Trump tweeted, blaming ""radical left wing politicians"" for the controversy.

Trump rejected the credibility of Ford's claim that a drunken Kavanaugh tried to pin her down and remove her clothes, muffling her cries, in the early 1980s.

According to Trump, the fact that Ford remained silent until now shows the incident probably never happened -- even if this runs counter to what experts say is the typical reaction of sexual assault victims afraid or embarrassed to report.

""I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr Ford was as bad as she says,"" Trump wrote, ""charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents.""

""Why didn't someone call the FBI 36 years ago?""

The senior Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, called Trump's logic ""a highly offensive misunderstanding of surviving trauma.""

More concerning for Trump might have been the angry reaction of one of his own Republican senators, Susan Collins, who sits on the Judiciary Committee.

""I was appalled by the president's tweet,"" she told US media.

""We know that allegations of sexual assault are some of the most under-reported crimes that exist. So I thought that the president's tweet was completely inappropriate and wrong.""

Trump's outburst saw a new #MeToo era hashtag storm the internet, with #WhyIDidntReport the top trending conversation starter on US Twitter, as people -- mostly women -- vented outrage over past transgressions and voiced solidarity with Ford.

High stakes

Republicans are frustrated over what they say was the deliberate timing of the last-minute revelation of Ford's allegation, accusing Democrats of seeking to prevent the process from finishing before the November midterm elections.

Democrats hope to recapture at least one chamber of Congress in the vote.

For their part, Democrats say Republicans are mounting an unseemly rush to get Kavanaugh into the nine-member Supreme Court while they still control the legislature.

Kavanaugh has repeatedly agreed to testify before the Republican-led Senate Judiciary Committee, saying he wants to clear his name.

A distinguished judge seen as favoring conservative interpretations of the constitution, he has not been accused in other sexual misconduct related cases and no further witness has come forward to corroborate Ford's claims.

While Kavanaugh has seen his near coronation transformed into a fight for his basic reputation, Ford has found herself thrown into the harsh light of an all-out Washington political fight.

ISLAMABAD - A three-member probe committee at Quaid-e-Azam University (QAU) has started hearing sexual harassment accusations made by a female student against her department in-charge but in the eyes of the media he has been already proven guilty.

Ajmal Waheed, the in-charge of Quaid-e-Azam School of Management Sciences (QASMS), said he is near to his retirement and it is for the first time in his 30 years career that a student who visited him twice in his office since her enrolment alleged such malicious charges against him.

Seeing her academic record and demands to withdraw cheating case against her and help her get passed in a subject, he had sensed that she may make any charges so he asked her subordinates to remain present in the office whenever she visited him, said Waheed. The day when alleged assault took place, technical assistant of the school Muhammad Imran was present and many other students were gathered in the adjacent room, the door of which opens into in-charge's room to get information about Prime Minister's laptop scheme, he said.

He maintains that in total strength of 750 of the school around 40 per cent are girls and he has supervised nearly 20 female students. ""They may complain about my strictness and other issues but no one levelled such allegations. And the way print and social media exaggerated the issue without any investigation and continued mudslinging, my damaged reputation would not restore even if the committee declares me innocent,"" he regretted.

The student denies that she cheated in exams of MBA 5th semester. She says the case was fabricated and the in-charge of school manipulated all the teachers to damage her academic record. She alleges when she visited his office to get his approval to rectify a mistake in marks of a subject he uttered some indecent remarks and demands. On hearing such remarks she got panic and ran away from the room and her shawl was left there.

But the administration staff and a professor who visited the in-charge at that time, however, viewed that the shawl gave them a feeling as if someone has deliberately put it on the chair to make a case.

There is another background of this issue that has been ignored, informed another professor of the school who wished anonymity. ""An inquiry against her for using unfair means in the exam was already going on and a disciplinary case was also under investigation against her class fellow who threatened the in-charge to take back the cheating case against her,"" he said.

The way application was written, moved and disseminated to media and social media systematically, it seems that the students are being used by other groups for their vested interests without thinking about the future of the students. They have headed towards the point of no return and don't know what they are trying to achieve, he remarked.

The teacher says that she used to work hard but business management was not her field. ""She was already on probation and in the 5th semester due to cheating case, wrong registration of a subject and failing to clear another subject she might be dropped out.""

The students are dissatisfied with university investigations and committee. But the administration says the case has been referred to an inquiry committee that was already probing another harassment case. ""Committee can't be made on the wishes of the accused and the victim. The committee was formed a few months ago after dissolution of the anti-harassment committee that will decide the case under efficiency and discipline rules as the university has been asked by the President Office that harassment act does not apply on educational institutions,"" informed QAU Vice Chancellor Dr Etazaz Ahmad.

Because of good repute of school in-charge and his rigorousness many teaching faculty members and students believe that the case is fake. ""It's become very easy to level such allegations and get away with all your past faults."" said a professor of Earth Science Department refusing to comment on record.

""Though in male dominated society there is harassment at every level yet a few reported cases are fake too. If a student comes to my room, goes back and says that I said some indecent things to her, I can't prove it wrong. And until it is proven wrong I will continue to be considered guilty by all. Now the teaching faculty has become so careful that they refuse to meet any student in their office to avoid such allegations,"" he opined.

Gender experts maintain that it does not matter whether someone enjoys a good repute or not in such cases and the past record of the students cannot be overlooked either. ""Sexual harassment does exist and it can be of various forms. Wherever power dynamics exist, such cases appear. As mostly men occupy managerial positions, women are mostly victims of harassment but it can be vice versa too,"" says Fatima Ihsan, faculty member of Gender Studies Centre, QAU.

Although by and large students are disrespected by teachers and officials in the administration and females feel unsafe in the campus yet there have been some false accusations as well, said Professor Dr Qaiser Mushtaq, former dean and syndicate member and chairman of anti-harassment committee.

He as a chairman of the committee probed four harassment cases and of them the decision of two cases was implemented by the administration.

There is a gender bias at the campus and almost all the students are frightened of the teachers' wrath. But, according to him, at least in three cases both parties were involved initially and the complaints were moved by either of the parties due to vested interests. The university administration also took the opportunity to twist arms for settling scores or for establishing it 'writ'.

'In the complaints the statements are contrasting and inadequate and biased information is provided. Politics comes in and the lobbyists start protecting their sides'. He found that strangely in most cases the students had poor academic performance and the complaints were either due to grievances of the students to take advantage. Sometimes, the university also digs out cases to punish the 'disliked' ones.

Such cases are appearing in every organisation including universities but somehow the cases in QAU are leaked to the media, said Maliha Hussain of Mehergarh, a nongovernmental organisation that has been leading the passage and the implementation of the law.

Maliha, who has been involved in resolving 3000 cases of harassment in the country, said the law can be misused like any other law and people spend their whole lives in jails on false accusations. Women can also misuse it but it does not mean it should be repealed, she said.

She said the protection against harassment of women at the workplace act, 2010 fully covers students and educational institutes and an official of the university who was proven guilty was pardoned by the then president on the advice of ministry of law that was sentenced without thoroughly reading the law.

She said the cases should be investigated carefully by trained committees to give justice to the real victims and the cases of false accusations should be referred to ombudsperson for any action.",['Asma Ghani'],"She says the case was fabricated and the in-charge of school manipulated all the teachers to damage her academic record.

NEW DELHI - Allegations a young engineer was kidnapped and made to marry at gunpoint are being investigated by police in one of India’s poorest states, which has a history of forced marriage of men.

Video footage apparently showing Vinod Kumar being forced to go through with a wedding by his bride’s family sparked the probe, police in the eastern state of Bihar said Friday.

‘Pakadua Vivah’ (forced marriage) is a practice specific to Bihar and surrounding areas, and is mainly carried out by poor families who cannot afford a dowry - still a widespread expectation in India. A video circulated on social media shows the engineer being manhandled and forced to dress for the wedding as he pleads for freedom.

“We are only performing your wedding, not hanging you,” one man is heard to shout as Kumar begs to be released.

Another video shows Kumar sitting beside his bride crying while a woman, apparently an in-law, tries to console him.

Lalan Mohan Prasad, a local officer, told AFP police had contacted Kumar and offered their help but he had not formally complained.

Local media quoted the engineer as saying one of the bride’s relatives had pointed a pistol at him after they met at a mutual friend’s wedding and ordered him to marry her.

Since the incident, he has reportedly escaped and returned to his home in neighbouring Jharkhand state.

Bihar has a long-held reputation for lawlessness and gang violence, with families thought to enlist organised criminals to help them carry out abductions and forced marriages.

Local social scientist Saibal Gupta said such marriages enjoyed widespread acceptance and tended to endure, given the stigma of divorce.

“The frequency of such kidnappings has come down, but certainly not stopped. Poverty is still rampant,” he told AFP.

Official figures show police received nearly 3,000 complaints of groom kidnapping in 2016. None of the marriages were annulled.",[],"Share:NEW DELHI - Allegations a young engineer was kidnapped and made to marry at gunpoint are being investigated by police in one of India’s poorest states, which has a history of forced marriage of men.

Local social scientist Saibal Gupta said such marriages enjoyed widespread acceptance and tended to endure, given the stigma of divorce.","['widespread', 'video', 'wedding', 'man', 'forced', 'engineer', 'marriage', 'shows', 'indian', 'media', 'kumar', 'told', 'kidnapped', 'social']","{'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2018-01-05/his-master-s-voice-1515178751-9525.jpg', 'https://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619912693.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/whatsapp_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/g_plus.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png?date=2019-02-15', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_publishrr.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/uploads/theme/logo-1550475639.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/epaper_image/medium/2021-05-02/Lahore/epaper_img_1619902433.gif', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/rsss.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/linkedin_share.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2018-01-06/indian-man-kidnapped-for-marriage-1515188431-1723.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/facebook.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/twitter.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2018-01-06/indian-man-kidnapped-for-marriage-1515188431-1723.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/logo_footer.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/android_app_on_play_logo_small.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/print_images/medium/2018-01-05/afghan-war-us-1515178776-6834.jpg', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/utube.png', 'https://nation.com.pk/assets/thenation/images/client/icons/app-store.png'}",True,https://nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2018-01-06/indian-man-kidnapped-for-marriage-1515188431-1723.jpg,1,,,,,nation

The National Assembly (NA) only yesterday passed a resolution that calls for public hanging of offenders for sexually abusing and murdering children. Once again, our legislators chose the easy way out for the rampant menace of child abuse, i.e., public hanging of the abusers. But easy solutions do not always prove to be the best.

Remember Javid Iqbal who had murdered at least one hundred children after abusing them? The court awarded him capital punishment in the strictest manner. Did that eradicate the menace of child abuse from society? No, that didn’t. Fast forward to Zainab’s case. Did the issue of child sexual abuse vanish into thin air with the uproar after the horrific murder of Zainab? No, it didn’t. After every such heinous crime the Pakistani public relies on emotions rather than rational faculties. This is the case with the resolution in question as well.

The fact that even some members of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), including ministers Fawad Chaudhry and Shireen Mazari, opposed the resolution shows that even the government is divided on whether such punishment will ever be useful in curbing the menace of child sexual abuse. Shireen Mazari, the Human Rights Minister, says that it is not government-sponsored. Perhaps, she’s telling the truth.

However, the question worth asking is this: why do members of the ruling party act in an individual capacity and not consult the cabinet on such important issues that need thorough deliberations? Moreover, the mover of the resolution was not an ordinary legislator. Ali Muhammad Khan, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs, presented it. The opposition of at least two sitting ministers to the resolution suggests the lack of coordination and working relationship among the cabinet members.

Nevertheless, the passing of the said resolution is highly disappointing. Such frivolous and superficial changes will do little to fix the problem on the ground. Without increasing funding for policing or setting up better facilities, undetected child abuse will continue. This argument is corroborated by the fact that even after the introduction of the death penalty for raping a minor, the menace of child abuse did not subside. In fact, since then, the cases of child abuse have increased.

Returning to inhumane and brutal execution methods after becoming a signatory to international conventions preventing capital punishments is a foreign policy mistake and moral regression to boot. It is clear that the death sentence does not deter crime. Countries who execute commonly cite the death penalty as a way to prevent people from committing a crime. This claim has been repeatedly discredited, and there is no evidence that the death penalty is any more effective in reducing crime than life imprisonment.",[],"Once again, our legislators chose the easy way out for the rampant menace of child abuse, i.e., public hanging of the abusers.

https://nation.com.pk/19-Oct-2017/metoo,2017-10-18 23:40:30+05:00,MeToo,"Share:

In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein allegations, Alyssa Milano, of Who’s the Boss and Charmed fame, started a #MeToo, social media campaign that has flooded Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The campaign aims to illustrate the prevalence of sexual harassment and sexual assault, and has clearly succeeded in the endeavour. Within just two days the campaign has successfully revealed the sheer magnitude of sexual violence. Milano’s campaign has received 80,000 responses, women, some men and members of the Trans community are participating in the campaign from all across the world.

The numbers are overwhelming, the stories are horrifying and the support is moving. But what else are we learning from this campaign?

Stories of sexual harassment and assault cut across industry, geographical locations, class, age, gender and marital status. The campaign may have started in response to predators in the U.S entertainment industry, but is definitely not restricted to it. In the local context, there are numerous stories surrounding the Lollywood industry and famous cricketers none of which have gained significant media attention nor inspired legal action. In the political realm, PTI leader Imran Khan has been accused of sexual harassment by Ayesha Gulalai Wazir and former PM Nawaz Sharif has been accused of sexual advances towards Kim Barker; both of which have been dismissed as ‘attention seeking’. Professors from LUMS, Karachi University and Punjab University have been accused sexual harassment, all of which have been settled within university affairs. The list goes on.

The volume of people participating in the campaign is large. The trend has caught fire because people feel empowered by sharing their stories. They have control over their narrative, they can choose to reveal as much or as little as they want, and are not forced to identify their abuser. People are allowed to define sexual assault in personal terms, and are not required to sanitize their language using legal or political jargon. As the assaults are not always directly described, mostly participants have been not gas-lighted nor trolled. There is a perceived safety in numbers, a common thread connecting all participants in solidarity. While all these conditions have contributed to the success of the social media campaign, it is depressing to realize that had all these conditions not be prevalent, the campaign would not have gained traction. In different circumstances participants of the campaign would have fallen prey to social media trolls and victim blamers.

However, the volume of people participating in the campaign can also be perceived as small. As with all cases of sexual violence there is a huge discrepancy between reported violence and actual violence. Revealing experiences of sexual assault and harassment on a public platform comes at a high price for many. Historically members of the LGBT community are less likely to report violence because it invites more violence, cyber bullying and therefore, psychological harm. Victims of sexual violence may be in intimate relationships with their abuser. Abusers may be in a position of power at home and in the workplace, and therefore in a position to punish the victim. Even well intentioned loved ones can add to the victims’ disempowerment but clumsily and persistently asking unwelcomed questions. In a hasty attempt to protect victims, near and dear could curtail the victim’s agency by imposing curfews, insisting that they quit their jobs and disallowing to independent access to public spaces. If one were to learn anything from this, is that participating in the #MeToo campaign is not case of jumping on the band wagon, but a deliberate and calculated move.

#MeToo is not the first of its kind. Other social media campaigns include #YesAllWomen and #EverydaySexism, both of which are run predominantly by women aiming to educate men about sexism and harassment. While acknowledging the power of social media campaigns, one can’t help but question the limits of its impact. It seems that women (and other victims) have to not only protect themselves, recover from abuse but also bear the burden of educating men. How many stories, how many campaigns will it take for men to believe us? Will the onus of preventing sexual harassment and assault ever fall on men?

I saw another Facebook post today, one that didn’t gain as much traction. It said “A heartfelt request to men: in the comments of this post please list one tangible action that you will take to end rape culture. (We know many of you are victims too, we believe you. But we still can’t solve this problem without you.)” – by Audra Williams.

Perhaps this should be the next social media campaign.",['Maheen Saeed'],"Share:In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein allegations, Alyssa Milano, of Who’s the Boss and Charmed fame, started a #MeToo, social media campaign that has flooded Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

It has been 25 years since the Montreal Massacre where 25 year old Marc Lépine felt compelled to go on a murder spree against women attending the École Polytechnique [Montreal University branch]. He viewed the young women studying in the field of STEM as feminists [who were threatening his male identity]. He ordered the men to leave the classroom and after successfully separating the males from females, he pulled the trigger on his first 9 female victims—killing 6 and critically injuring 3. He then walked through the school and continued the murder spree before turning the gun on himself. His war on women lasted 20 minutes on the evening of December 6, 1989, and in those terrifying 20 minutes—14 women lost their lives and 10 other women were injured along with 4 men.

He declared [to the students] he was at war with feminism. He left behind a suicide note identifying his targets, intentions and reasoning. He also expressed concerns of being painted a madman by the media by reassuring [in the note] that he is quite rational. As he shot the first 9 victims, he claimed they were studying to become engineers therefore they must be feminists. In Lépine’s world—a woman who makes use of her intellect is a feminist and deserving of death.

Misogyny walked the halls of an educational institution and took down 14 lives in its own honour that evening.

What Lépine felt wasn’t unique—many felt [and continue to feel] his pang—along with the MRA (Male Rights Activism) movement who hailed him a “hero”. He felt hatred for women who dared to live a life free of conformity to a patriarchal culture. His interpretation of “feminists” was women who were educated and independent—and so it was clear [to him] they had to die. He was sending these sinners to meet their “Maker” and soon after the massacre, the apologia and unnecessary confusion on the “why” began.

It had nothing to do with violence against women and girls (VAWG)—he was a “madman” with a gun and a knife [as he predicted he’ll be portrayed] who was ‘acting out’ because of his father’s abuse! Ignore his suicide letter—his words don’t matter. When it comes to the realm of crimes against the female gender—no amount of physical evidence is valid enough to deliver justice by labeling the crime for what it really is. What matters is how the world can now deviate from the concern of VAWG by deflecting this sinister act [deeply rooted from misogyny and sexism] and reiterate Lépine’s own view on how great women and girls have it in society.

For those living in the West, the name Elliot Rodger also rings a bell. He provided a manifesto declaring a “war on women” because they [the women] rejected his sexual advances. The manifesto also contained his contempt for other men who had better sexual opportunities [with women]. He also provided a scathing rant on his hatred for racial minorities and the LGBTQ. So, on May 23, 2014, in Isla Vista [California], the 22 year old Elliot Rodger casually commenced his “retribution” on the “sluts” and the men of these “sluts”, and the racial minorities and anybody else that was in the remote vicinity of his prowling. He murdered 6 people and injured 13 others before killing himself.

But society believed the trigger point of Rodger’s was a mental disorder because he killed men too—so there’s no way it could have been even partially triggered by misogyny—in fact, it was described as a non-VAWG crime because he was just a mentally unstable young man with an undiagnosed condition.

Rodger spent sufficient time in MRA forums [that are infamous for inciting VAWG and dictating misogyny and sexism]. His “retribution” video on YouTube specifically identified the source of his rage—which was that he was a lonely, sexually deprived, 22 year old male virgin [and the girls and women who had rejected him since he reached puberty needed to be punished for such “injustice” and “crime”]. He also blasted his family members and yet all the evidence contained in his manifestos clearly pinpoint the trigger was a result of rejection by the “beautiful” women and girls he had pursued.

They should have embraced him instead of being alarmed by his questionable behaviour! He’s the “supreme gentleman”—how could women and girls just pass up his charm?!

Once again—the killer’s own words are irrelevant even though he gave his reasoning on a platter of misogyny, sexism and racism topped with a dressing of narcissism and gun powder.

To brush this off as an act of another madman of society [who just happened to also have a misogynistic rage he thoroughly documented and left behind as evidence prior to the attacks] only encourages more boys and men who feel justified in their misogyny.

I doubt the people who suffer from genuine mental illness take pleasure in being grouped in with the likes of Marc Lépine and Elliot Rodger and be indirectly implicated in acts of such violence as if they aren’t already facing enough abuse under the stigma of mental illness.

The horrific murder of Zahra Abdille and her two children [from Toronto] was one of the stories of VAWG and domestic violence that made headlines on November 29, 2014 in Canada.

Zahra Abdille had fled to a shelter due to domestic violence. She expressed concerns for the safety of her two children, Faris and Zain, and herself, at the hands of her husband, Yusuf Abdille. She attempted to get custody of the children but she was a nurse and made more income than what would qualify her for assistance from Legal Aid Ontario (LAO)—so it was reported LAO refused her a certificate to retain a lawyer and her efforts for custody were presumed unsuccessful. What were her choices—or rather what was the only choice the system had left her? She couldn’t afford private housing or a lawyer to fight her abuser legally. So she went back to live with her husband, hoping for a reconciliation. Soon after Zahra and her two children returned to live with Yusuf, they were murdered. Yusuf then committed suicide by plummeting off a bridge and was run over by a vehicle.

If he can’t have her—no one else can—not even Zahra herself.

The skeptics of marital rape make the survival of women fleeing domestic violence more difficult. I would like to welcome these skeptics to the civilized world where a marriage contract has never once equated consent to sexual activity.

A marriage contract is a unity of people—not a license to violate a woman’s body.

VAWG is a primitive form of violence and oppression; it’s an age-old apartheid enforced by religion and other patriarchal fronts. The greatest threat to every woman and girl is daring to live even an ordinary life of choice free of male discretion—which the women and girls living in the East can attest to on a wider spectrum.

The nature of VAWG taking place in the East isn’t too different from the ones occurring in the West. The only obvious difference would have to be the navigation pertaining to the survival of the victims. The West provides safer access to resources for women and girls to deal with the abuse. The west also has a better legal support system protecting female rights along with better economical standard which helps fortify their survival.

Wherever there is VAWG—it goes hand in hand with financial abuse. Developing nations with economic gender inequality also has one of the worst rates of human rights abuse [disproportionately affecting the female population].

Pakistan is number two on the list led by Chad as the top two worst countries with economic inequality. Women in the West still make approximately 20% less on an equal job to their male counterpart—this ratio is much worse in the developing world. Over 70% of minimum wage jobs are also held by women and girls worldwide.

In the East, the rate of women dying by freak accidents like a kitchen gas explosion is questionably high [as it occurs often in south Asia]—especially when it is reported the in-laws have dowry feuds with the bride and her family.

Yes, “dowry” is still a thing in the East because nothing speaks “love” like buying a bride.

In the Middle East and Central Asia, countless women and girls have been horrifically injured or died as a result of being doused with acid and other forms of violence for refusing to wear certain religious attire or conform to the idea that females are inferior to males.

Less than 50% of females are literate in most developing nations, mainly due to cultural bans on education for their gender. The outrage the demand for universal education creates is beyond any logical comprehension. Malala Yousafzai, the brave little girl from Pakistan advocating for educational rights, took a bullet to the head for her line of activism. That’s how deadly it is to obtain education while being a female in some countries in the 21st century.

Every day, 23,000 girls under the age of 18 are forced to marry a man twice their age and end up becoming voiceless victims of physical and sexual abuse while being used for the purpose of giving birth—but criticizing this trend of human rights abuses foreigners deem “cultural and religious rights” is labeled “gross and racist” by western pseudo liberals like Ben Affleck who unwittingly promote gender apartheid and anti-liberal democracy in the developing world.

In nations like Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan—there is a great volume of female prisoners who are found “guilty” of “moral crimes” which range from being a victim of sexual violence to domestic violence. There is also an alarming rate of women being accused of “adultery” by their husband whenever there are unresolved marital conflicts—and the punishment for such a crime is almost always death.

And in all nations—there’s foeticide—where the fetus is aborted simply because it is a female instead of a male. With this kind of parental love—who needs the MRA?

In the USA, the rights of females are constantly under threat by religious and conservative zealots. Recently, the state of Michigan passed a bill banning abortion coverage in insurance plans and suggested if a woman or girl require abortion due to sexual violence—these women and the parents of underage female children should buy a separate insurance plan that will cover abortion in the case of rape. Basically, consider yourselves as a future rape victim if you want an abortion after being impregnated by rape. Haven’t you realized by now that VAWG can be committed upon you at any random time and if you don’t have this “rape insurance” handy—you’ll be forced to relive the trauma by giving birth to a child who was created through an abhorrent crime committed upon you. That’s the message USA is working hard to enforce on its female population.

Who can forget Arizona? It’s another state in the USA, much like Michigan, and it too is eager to trample on the rights of women and girls. They want to grant employers the right to fire female employees who take birth control for the prevention of pregnancy—in other words—dictate their sexual life. As if religious and cultural fanaticism wasn’t already keeping the rights of women and girls in the dark ages—this land of the free that preaches about democracy wants to police women’s sexual lives and meddle with their reproductive rights which play a primary role in VAWG.

A woman or girl who is suffering VAWG is undeniably in the most vulnerable state while pregnant. Most victims who report physical and sexual abuse at the hands of an intimate partner also reported the severity of violence escalated when they were discovered to be pregnant.

The number one killer of women is not cancer—it is in fact VAWG. While a little over 6,500 US soldiers died in the Iraq and Afghanistan war combined—almost 12,000 women died within the same period in USA as a result of VAWG.

In Canada, over 3000 women flee domestic violence every night and live in shelters [with their children] just so they don’t end up becoming a gruesome evening news scene. Understand that if these women did not have a shelter to find refuge in—they will become homeless with their children which increases vulnerability to all sorts of violence from rape [by strangers] and kidnapped and forced into the slave-sex-trafficking industry which is globally a multimillion dollar “business” and a vast majority of its victims also happen to be women and children.

Race-based misogyny is as prevalent as any other form of misogyny. Women and girls of colour face a dire form of systematic and domestic abuse. Their rights as immigrants is already limited by the system that dehumanize their gender only to be further crippled by the phobia of the melanin levels in their body [or I can just say their “skin colour” but I really don’t want to oversimplify the bigotry of racism]. VAWG is a double threat to this female population because they have to endure both cultural and race-based misogyny.

Many women are scrutinized for not “leaving” abusive relationships—yet nobody dare tell them where they are supposed to go legally. As explained above, the system makes sure majority of victims are financially less privileged so they can’t move to another country or city nor can they afford a lawyer or shelter in moments of need. It’s like being trapped in a warzone and being denied refuge in neighboring countries, just waiting to be killed.

Even in cases of highly documented domestic violence—family courts rarely allow a mother to relocate to another city with her children [far from the abusive parent] because even if he had beat and raped the mother, he still has the right to see the children [even if he had abused the children too]—so the children always end up becoming used as leverage [by the abuser] to punish the woman for ending the relationship. And if by chance she does find her own housing—the abuser will stalk her and the children at work and/or at school.

So why doesn’t she just get a restraining order? Assuming we’re discussing the VAWG occurring in the Western world [because in most developing Eastern nations, there’s no such thing as a “restraining order” for women fleeing violence]—a restraining order isn’t as powerful as many believe and it isn’t simple to obtain either. If the courts do grant a restraining order and the abuser starts violating it—the chances of the abuser being found guilty of contempt of the order is difficult. He can violate the order 6 times in a row and still the police will refuse to lay charges because in the court of law—the act of violating the restraining order must be proven as an “intentional” act. So as long as the abuser keeps claiming the violations were all “accidental”—he will rarely face charges. And on most stalking cases related to VAWG and domestic violence—the stalker ends up murdering or physically harming his partner and/or their children.

When it comes to male stalking—the likelihood of it escalating to sexual or physical violence and/or murder is exponentially high in comparison to female stalking and that is the statistic which helped set a better foundation to combat VAWG in Canada [by enforcing the police to view all stalking complaints as legitimate]—not that it has prevented stalkers from stalking their victims but it had rather provided a relief from the world of skepticism and empowered victims to come forward.

So, back to the question of “why doesn’t she just leave him”—are these women supposed to leave their children with their abusive partner and flee for their own safety or do they take a chance and remain with the abuser to continue being tortured so their children aren’t harmed behind closed doors and suffer as they did? The court system is definitely not giving them a fair chance to fight the abuse legally.

Damned if she leaves and damned if she stays. That’s “why”.

We know the names of the victims of Marc Lépine, Elliot Rodger and Yusuf Abdille—they’re all just a simple Google search away. But what about the names of victims we don’t read or hear about? We know that in Canada a woman is murdered by her intimate partner every 5 days—but the media doesn’t report about a dead woman every 5 days. So where are the tears of indignation and outrage for this unprecedented scale of violence [stemming from misogyny] women and children face across every nation on this planet we dare call home?

If the world collectively writes obituaries every time a women and girl are killed by male entitlement—would that reduce the skepticism? Rejecting the scale of VAWG is no different from rejecting science and insisting the Earth is flat and at the center of the universe and the human race was birthed from the incestuous relationship of Adam and Eve’s children. If you believe in evolution—it’s time to start considering the evolution of misogyny which is being celebrated as “culture”, “tradition” and “religion”.

The finest way to discuss VAWG is through the most flagrant method of communication—laying out facts just the way they are without filters and frills. Women and girls are human beings—their lives aren’t tainted material that must be filtered for the usage of someone else for the purpose of “tradition”.

Only solution to end VAWG [and domestic violence] is to denounce the objectification of the female gender and make solidarity for these victims louder than the silence that keeps them bound and bruised and leaves them much too often in a pool of their own blood.

VAWG is in fact a global health crisis—affecting millions of women and girls. This continues to make Feminism a valid and necessary movement no matter how much it is deemed a glorified villain by the world of Patriarchy because in this world of Patriarchy—there will be neither proper justice nor democracy until women, girls and LGBTQ are emancipated from its grip.

People often conveniently forget that females are co-creators of society. There isn’t a foot of intellectual value in any society until absolute equality is mandated as a fundamental human right [for all genders] across the globe [without prejudice] and until the occurrence of this phenomenon—humanity will continue to squander its mutual endurance and commit itself to a much darker social crisis.

If you want to help end VAWG—it’s imperative to concede to its reality—concede to the fact that it’s the most prevalent form of violence. Most acts of VAWG are almost never committed in the hallways of a public institution or sidewalks, nor do the abusers leave behind a manifesto to identify their guilt. It’s committed behind closed doors where the only witnesses are the abusers and their victims which is why the only person who can actually “stop” VAWG is the abuser. The only way the abuser can do this is by acknowledging the victims as equal human beings and the only way to even remotely convince abusers of this fact is by holding them accountable for their own actions.

It’s a tough pill to swallow when one lives in a glass house thriving off the convenience provided by the enslavement of the female gender.

Racism triggers people to protest and march the streets, demanding justice. But for misogyny—the most common serial element in all races, cultures, religions and nationalities—all it triggers is skepticism and mockery. Every life matters—which means female lives matter too—so hashtag that.

Misogyny isn’t a faceless, invincible God that creates nonbelief—it is a tyrant in the form of the worst human rights abuse taking place since the dawn of civilizations and into the 21st century. It has a face. It has a name—violence against women and girls.

Before the arrival of our next century, we must canvas VAWG and apply permanent solutions. It’s beyond appalling to witness tolerance to a world that romanticizes misogyny as culture, religion and tradition. What’s more devastating is how it is worshiped in the name of bronze aged nonsense. It’s time to issue a confession on this collective bigotry and end it once and for all.

Willful ignorance will not alter the necessity to leave behind the puerile mindset and get used to the reminder of what greatness every living, breathing women and girls could have been long accomplishing since the get-go if only they hadn’t been dehumanized and enslaved to childbirth and male egotism.

Rawalpindi-The parents, relatives and other area residents on Monday placed the dead body of a 14 year old boy on GT Road and staged a protest demonstration against police for not arresting his killers.

The infuriated protestors also blocked GT Road for all kinds of traffic movement putting the commuters into great trouble in scorching heat. They demanded Inspector General of Police (IGP) Punjab to take notice of brutal killing of the young boy.

On Sunday, a citizen Aqeel Ahmed has lodged a complaint with Police Station (PS) Gujar Khan stating he is a jeweller and his son Zeeshan Aqeel has also been working with him to make gold ornaments. He added that one of customers Arslan Javed called his son to come to the underpass to recieve an order for some gold ornaments. Zeeshan went to underpass to meet Arslan but did not return. In the evening, the bullet-riddled body of Zeeshan was recovered from Mahndar Road near Bochal by police while his Suzuki carry vehicle and three gold chains were also found missing, Aqeel told police. The applicant requested police to register a case and arrest the killer of his son. Police registered murder case and began investigation with no arrest so far.

“Arrest the killers of Zeeshan” and “Police are showing no interest in murder case” were the slogans chanted by the protestors. “I have no enmity with anyone. My son was killed without any reason. Police are not arresting his killers,” said Aqeel Ahmed while talking to media men. A heavy contingent of police reached the spot and tried to negotiate the protestors but the mob refused to open the road for traffic.

Meanwhile, an 18 year old youngster drowned in Khalabutt Dam within limits of Police Station Gujar Khan. The deceased was identified as Adnan.

One of the perks of living in 21st century is believing in virtual reality. One may easily think that gender discrimination is now merely a myth. The girl next door is doing a job, getting higher education, she even goes to market alone instead of being locked down within the four walls of the house. It’s impossible that someone is going to force her into something against her will. But the picture is far bleak. The same girl is soon forcefully married to keep the respect of family.

Obviously education has given her a voice and confidence but soon everyone reproaches education as the main culprit for the girl to express her opinion. In a battle between girl’s happiness and family’s respect, latter wins most of the time. The tactics for achieving this success differs in variant segments of our society from emotional trauma, physical violence to simply selling her off. This is just one form of domestic violence that 90 percent of women in Pakistan experience at the hands of families or husbands. Physical, psychological and sexual abuse from intimate partners are much common then it appears to be. The intensity of the situation can be well acquainted by a survey done by Thomson Reuters Foundation which ranked Pakistan as the third dangerous country for women next to Afghanistan and Congo.

Sadly, most of the times domestic violence goes unnoticed. Statistics show that only 0.4 percent women take their cases to court. One of the major reasons is the societal brought up which inculcates that it’s okay to be abused by males of the family. The common norm that it the duty of a female to keep quiet in front of any kind of abuse by her family and especially her husband is a quotidian notion. A recent survey carried out by Gallup Pakistan, shows that 65 percent Pakistanis believe domestic violence is a family’s personal problem; not to be interfered by social organisations and media. Other reasons for this patriarchal notion includes lack of awareness regarding basic human and legal rights, financial dependence on male members of the family, psychological pressure due to marriages within extended family and fear of societal reactions.

There are proper women shelters and government organisations for social welfare and women protection in all the provinces. In addition, there are a number of non-governmental bodies working for women against domestic violence. However, the number of people well informed about them is a drop in the bucket. The Punjab Protection of Women against Violence Act (PPWAVA) provided unprecedented protection to women against domestic violence. It encompasses domestic, psychological, emotional, economic as well as cyber abuse. The irony of our society is that most of the time women protection laws are highly criticised and made controversial by male segment of clerics and others as un-Islamic and so forth. This clarifies that the problem is very deep rooted. Furthermore, the lack of awareness about the protection laws particularly among females remains a major issue.

Merely setting up institutions and passing laws won’t help the situation unless the issue is taken seriously and efforts are made to dig out the root causes which exacerbate this evil. The first and the foremost step could be a nationwide awareness campaign discouraging domestic violence of all kinds. Of course, media can play a vital role in spreading the awareness about women protection and their legal rights to the most remote corners of the country. Proper enforcement of women protection laws will uplift the confidence among women. Moreover, empowering women in all the fields of life will further minimise the alarming statistics of domestic violence.

It’s easy said than done. Why women don’t get out of abusive marriages or speak up for their rights is a general question asked by many. The emotional and psychological trauma faced by women shatters their self confidence in most of the cases. They think of this abuse as their fate. The most feasible solution they could think of is to stay quiet usually for most of their lives. They secretly hope for things to get better or wait for a miracle to happen. But miracles seldom happen, making them immune to the domestic violence which they consider as part of their daily life. This is the silent evil flourishing in most of the households. It is the duty of all the individuals of our society to help those who are forcefully shunned of their basic human and legal rights. But charity begins at home. If only we realise that women are as human as males, they have basic human and legal rights and that they can also have freedom of expression which will certainly halt this evil forever. If the cost of maintaining family’s respect or saving marriage is destruction of a woman physically or psychologically then the cost is simply too high.",['Sania Akram Khan'],"This is just one form of domestic violence that 90 percent of women in Pakistan experience at the hands of families or husbands.

Chaman - An eight-year-old boy was killed and nine others were injured on Sunday after a bomb planted in a car exploded in border town of Balochistan.

The bomb was planted in the car parked on a market street in the town, which faces Afghanistan’s town of Spin Boldak and has seen several bomb and suicide attacks in the past, and was detonated by a remote control, police said.

In the powerful blast on Taj Road, a child identified as Zabihullah was killed while nine others were injured, senior police official Habib Baluch said. The injured were moved to District Civil Hospital Chaman, he added. The blast also destroyed two vehicles and a motorcycle. It was not yet clear who was behind the attack.

“An eight-year old boy was killed and six others were wounded when a bomb planted on a car exploded in Taj Bazaar,” local police station chief Agha Mohammad told AFP. Balochistan Home Secretary Akbar Hussain Durrani confirmed the bombing and casualties. Durrani said four of the wounded had been discharged from hospital after treatment.

TEXAS-Two teenage boys were hoping to make a deal with the devil when they killed a 15-year-old suburban Houston girl in a satanic ritual, a prosecutor said.

Seventeen-year-old Jose Reyes and a 16-year-old are accused of carving an upside-down crucifix on her stomach. Reyes and the boy, whose name is not being released because he is a juvenile, each face a capital murder charge for the death of Corriann Cervantes.

Authorities say that after the boys lured Cervantes to a vacant apartment in southeastern Houston on February 5, they hit her with an ashtray and toilet tank lid and stabbed her in the face with a screwdriver. Reyes, who was arrested on Sunday, made a brief court appearance on Tuesday. He is being held without bond. Harris county prosecutor John Jordan said that at one point during the assault, Cervantes yelled out to them: “Why are you doing this to me?” “The juvenile inquired that if he committed a murder, would that basically initiate him into being able to sell his soul to the devil, of which Mr Reyes said: ‘Yes,”‘ Jordan said. According to police, Cervantes’ partly clothed body was discovered early on Saturday when a resident of the apartment building noticed the door to the vacant unit was open.",[],"Share:CBSTEXAS-Two teenage boys were hoping to make a deal with the devil when they killed a 15-year-old suburban Houston girl in a satanic ritual, a prosecutor said.

The recent allegations of sexual harassment that have emerged at schools and universities in Lahore should surprise no one. We have been here before and we will be back here again. Without institutions taking responsibility for putting policies and trainings in place, and without wider society reflecting on our unwillingness to talk about harassment, we are bound to repeat these patterns.

In late 2019, students at University of Balochistan spoke up about being recorded by CCTV cameras at private spaces across campus and being blackmailed over it. The FIA carried out an investigation, and while it appears no one was charged, the university’s Vice Chancellor stepped down. However, he was promptly hired by a private university in Lahore.

Just this month, students at LUMS in Lahore have bravely spoken up against the behaviours by men on campus that they have been unable to take up before the university’s sexual harassment committee.

What is it about sexual harassment that refuses to go away? It crops up in educational institutions, public and private, in every part of the country. It crops up in workplaces and sports clubs alike. Sexual harassment, it appears, is everywhere. The mind panics, and, one leans towards gender segregation and surveillance across campuses as a solution to this menace. But these solutions are already part of campus life and have not ameliorated the problem.

The Punjab Education Minister, Dr. Murad Raas, has been among many to suggest that men not be allowed to teach at women’s campuses to curb this problem. But this is hardly the solution. Inherently, it implies that men are incapable of controlling themselves around women and girls, an implication we should all find offensive. It is also an imperfect solution for a world where all genders intermingle at offices and public spaces alike. The suggestion also ignores the fact that sexual harassment and sexual assault are common at boys’ educational institutions. An approach that teaches all of us to respect difference and personal space would serve us better.

Another knee-jerk solution adopted by schools and backed by parents is of increasing the use of cameras on campus. This is an expensive solution that cannot be replicated at public schools. Security footage is highly susceptible to being copied or leaked, as has been the case at Lahore’s Safe City Authority in the past. Our privacy and the ownership of our own body is important to us, and we should be careful about normalising the idea of sacrificing it for the illusion of safety.

Some suggestions of dress codes on university campuses and schools have also been put forward. Proponents of this approach forget that dress codes and distancing between the sexes are already mandated at public and private university campuses alike. No amount of covering protects women from being assaulted and harassed in public, as women are acutely aware.

All these solutions are short-sighted and misguided. Their proponents forget that what breeds sexual harassment is power, supported by a culture of silence. Decades of feminist research has established that sexual harassment counts on the victim being cornered into compliance because of the power the harasser holds over her—he is her teacher who grades her papers, a professor who supervises her thesis, a department chair who signs off on her academic documents, the campus security supervisor who no one can question and who has access to all security cameras. At the very least, the harasser is a man whose word will always be believed over that of a woman. A woman’s credibility depends on her moral character being absolutely beyond doubt.

This power difference is worsened by a culture of silence. Our ideas of shame make it hard to talk about anything sexual in nature, including unwelcome sexual advances. All educators understand that the word ‘sex’ even as part of ‘sexual harassment awareness’ is not welcome in Pakistan society. School girls, women at university and working women alike would always prefer to handle sexual harassment on their own, or ignore it altogether, rather than have their parents find out about it. They worry that they will be blamed for inviting this behaviour, or at the very least, have their mobility curbed on the pretext of better security for them. Our cultural silence around private affairs cannot distinguish between welcome and unwelcome sexual interaction.

To address this power differential, we need to introduce curriculum in schools that educates children about overcoming this shame, how to spot and address sexual harassment. We need robust, well-trained and independent sexual harassment committees in schools and universities, efforts for which are already underway. Institutions need to ensure that their committees are transparent and independent, not just populated by the very administration that students cannot trust.

Students, in turn, need to be empowered to speak up. Trainings on harassment are one way to do that. But they will fall short until students feel safe in numbers in being able to complain against a popular teacher. This comes with robust and independent student government and student unions on campus. Censoring students’ activities online, as some schools have begun doing, has the opposite effect and will only silence reports of sexual harassment further.

As a society, we need to have honest conversations about how we perpetuate this culture of silence. The taboo of sex must be overcome, ideas of consent and ownership, control and protection of one’s body need to be strengthened. In post-Kasur Pakistan, we have become exhausted from hearing of sexual crimes despite increased punishment and introduction of new laws. Now, it is our duty to turn to social rather than purely legal solutions, or we are bound to repeat these mistakes again.

Through the column of your esteemed newspaper, I would like to draw attention towards the important issue of domestic violence in Pakistan, which is an endemic social and public health problem. It is estimated that between 20 and 30 percent of women in Pakistan have suffered same form of abuse. An estimated 5000 women are killed per year from domestic violence, with thousands of others maimed or disabled. The majority of victims of violence have no legal resources. Law enforcement authorities do not view domestic violence as a crime, and usually refuse to register any cases brought to them. Given the very few women’s shelters in the country, victims have limited ability to escape from violent situations. Something must be done to address this important issue.

“Yes, you are!” comes the reply. It is going to happen one day so why not today? Why not now?

Struggling for arguments to back up her idea of living her dreams before marriage, she retorts back helplessly.

“There’s a lot I want to do before I end up living a life of an ordinary girl”, she says, this time hopeful that she has hit the right point.

“Life of an ordinary girl? This life is the ultimate destiny. No matter how extraordinary a girl might be, getting an ideal life partner is all she wishes for at one point of her life or another, besides, you will still get to live your dreams after the wedding.”

Dreams, they say. The same dreams they imparted in her, the ones she grew up hoping to fill one day. But here she sits now like a dolled up lamb to the slaughter, fighting a never-ending battle inside her head about whether or not should she kill the phoenix born from the ashes of her murdered hopes, yet again.

I do not intend to write against early marriage for I believe in it from a religious perspective but what I do find perplexing is that our society has taken it to a new level. It remains a tragic reality that females in our society are left at the mercy of the 'decision-makers'. They are the people who decide their future. Be it a father who decides the academic career of his daughter, certain that his daughter cannot decide for herself, a brother who remains eager to watch the way his sister breathes, and finally her husband who is to decide the rest of her life. Fair enough!

The patriarchal society of ours has been suppressing females and their rights in the name of either the religion or the prevalent societal norms, rendering them helpless and complacent.

Having said that, I now come towards the other part of this piece; marriage as the binding force. Marrying children against their will binds them in a forceful bond. Choosing the right life partner does not only make one content and happy, but also helps them attain their goals and set them even higher. However, looking around in our society, we find a lot of people facing the aftermath of forced marriages. Devoid of love and affection, couples either end up divorcing each other or spending their entire lives unhappily.

It is very important to marry with one’s consent and equally important to marry when one is ready to do so. Giving up on dreams because your partner wants you to is the worst case scenario. There is a dire need to bring this fact into consideration that marrying the daughters when they reach puberty is not really rightful until they are not ready to accept the new life with new challenges that await them.",['Marryam Suleman'],"Struggling for arguments to back up her idea of living her dreams before marriage, she retorts back helplessly.

The arrest of a Paedophile linked to global porn ring and his confessions have once again jolted the society’s consciousness. His story is a horrendous one. As if assaulting minors was not enough, we are told that the arrested person, Sohail Ayaz, was a consultant with the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) as well. Unfortunately, the government does not check the criminal record of its employees and consultant while hiring them.

The normal practice of hiring requires a mere confirmation from the employees whether they were involved in any crime in the past or not. And that’s it. The government does not bother to check the criminal record of any of its employee. This is not just limited to KP, by the way. Relying on the words of the employees is the norm across the country. But one hopes that the government will now take concrete steps to avoid any such occurrence in future. That much said it is essential to say a few words on the prevalent child abuse in our society. Despite the much hue and cry after Zainab’s murder, the society has not moved an inch in making the environment safe for its children. The case of Sohail Ayaz where the neighbours came forward to tell about his suspicious activities only after his arrest is a testimony to the argument made above.

Repeating the numbers for 2018 annual report of Sahil, an organisation that works on security and protection of children from sexual abuse, “at least ten children are abused daily in Pakistan.” Ten children daily! Even such a high number of abuses is not enough to awaken the government from its slumber. This is shameful.

Nevertheless, the latest arrest tells us that both crime prevention and social protection mechanisms have failed in protecting children from sexual abuse. In Pakistan, reliance is on short-term measures like punishing one or two culprits. However, such short-term solutions are not enough to curb the widespread issue of child abuse.

There is no simple way forward to curb this menace. The solution needs to be multi-pronged. First, the state must come up with legislation having no loopholes. Second, there is an urgent need of initiating a public dialogue against the issue at hands. Third, national curriculum needs to be redesigned to better educate children about the issue and its various forms. This way, the society and state by pointing out the fault lines and working together can fix the problem of child abuse.",[],"That much said it is essential to say a few words on the prevalent child abuse in our society.

Shah Hussain, who stabbed law student Khadija Siddiqui 23 times in Lahore in May 2016, was arrested on Wednesday after the Supreme Court overturned the Lahore High Court (LHC) order regarding his acquittal.

A three-member bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Asif Saeed Khosa heard Khadija's appeal against the LHC's (LHC) acquittal of her attacker and classmate Shah Hussain.

While declaring LHC's acquittal of Shah Hussain as null and void, the top court ordered Shah Hussain's arrest and upheld a decision of a sessions court to sentence him to five years in prison.

As the hearing went under way, CJP Khosa was informed that suspect Shah Hussain was present in court. Justice Khosa remarked, “We want to see whether the LHC’s conclusion was in accordance with the evidence.”

Khadija’s lawyer then told the bench, “The LHC did not see the complete evidence present in the case. Khadija’s sister also appeared as a witness.""

The lawyer of the law student continued, “Shah Hussain was Khadija’s classmate and stabbed her 23 times. He even attacked her twice on her neck. According to doctors, Khadija was bleeding when she was brought to the hospital.”

Justice Khosa observed, “Khadija knew the suspect but he was named five days after the incident took place.”

At this, Khadija’s lawyer said that she was not in her senses at the time of the attack. “She had even termed the doctors as strangers,” the lawyer said.

“Shah Hussain planned and only attacked Khadija,” the lawyer continued.

Stating that Khadija’s sister also “delayed naming the suspect”, the chief justice said, “They both were law students, now we should practice law.”

“The most important question is why did Shah Hussain want to kill Khadija? Was this question put on record?” Justice Khosa asked.

“The suspect had a lot of chances to kill. Why did he decide to kill in a crowded area and was this point brought on record?” the chief justice further questioned.

“Stabbings can be a result of provocations, if the boy was interested in the girl then why did he want to kill her?” he added.

Khadija’s lawyer responded, “It is on record that they both were very close to each other. Seven months before the attempted killing, they both ended the relationship.”

“Shah Hussain kept insisting and Khadija kept rejecting. This is a case of insistence and rejection,” the lawyer upheld. “Khadija gained conscience five days after the attack and immediately named Shah Hussain as the suspect.”

The chief justice added that the “recovery memo states that a helmet and two hair were found”. “Was a DNA conducted of the hair?” the chief justice asked.

Khadija’s lawyer responded, “Police said that they sent the hair to the forensic lab but they did not receive it.”

Justice Khosa remarked, “In such cases there are two conditions – one is if not mine then no one’s and the other is that the girl might have something that can be used to blackmail the boy.”

The chief justice further questioned, “Did the prosecution also request to suspend LHC’s decision?”

Khadija’s lawyer then said, “Any decision by the court is acceptable to us other than forwarding the matter to the high court.”

On defence counsel Khalid Ranjha’s request, the chief justice granted Shah Hussain two minutes to present his arguments. “I was nominated because I refused to marry and ended the relationship,” Shah Hussain said. “Khadija expressed reservations over the letters that were sent to me for cross-examination,” he added.

“The prosecution attempted to portray me as a ‘desperate person’,” the suspect further said.

Khadija, who is currently studying in the United Kingdom and arrived in Islamabad earlier this week to attend the hearing, told the court, “Shah Hussain used to emotionally blackmail me.”

When the chief justice asked Khadija regarding the statement she gave to the doctors, the law student replied, “I remember very little and can’t even recall whether I spoke at all or not.”

“I did not even know whether I am alive or not,” she added.

Earlier, on May 3, 2016, Khadija was stabbed 23 times by Shah Hussain, her classmate on Lahore’s Davis Road.

On July 29, Lahore judicial magistrate sentenced Hussain to seven years in prison, however, on June 4, the Lahore High Court acquitted Hussain.

KARACHI - Three policemen and a boy were killed and another injured when a police mobile came under attack in district Korangi of Karachi on Friday evening.

According to police, armed motorcyclists attacked the police mobile van near Darul Uloom in Korangi within the limits of Awami Colony police station, killing two policemen and a passerby boy on the spot while another cop succumbed to his injuries on his way to the hospital. The victims were immediately taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medico legal formalities and medical treatment.

The cops killed were identified as assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Qamaruddin and a constable as Muhammad Babar while a boy as 12-year-old Muhammad Zahid. The injured cop who died at the hospital was identified as constable Amjad while a 15-year-old boy, namely Muhammad Abid was admitted to the hospital with critical injuries.

JPMC executive director Dr Seemin Jamali confirmed that three cops and a passerby boy were killed in the attack. “Two cops were brought dead to hospital while third Amjad succumbed to his injuries during treatment,” she explained. “Now we are trying to save the life of another child who is remained admitted at hospital.” She said that all the victims had multiple bullet injuries in their upper torso while they were shot with a close range.

Extra contingent of law enforcers including Rangers and police reached the site and collected the evidence. “Nothing could say exactly about the incident as what the investigations are in preliminary level But our initial investigations suggests that the armed motorcyclists targeted the police van while the police personnel were busy in patrolling in the area,” said Awami Colony SHO Muhammad Farooq.

Police officials said that the injured children were passersby and became victims of the incident.

Police officials said that they have also collected the evidences from the crime scene while also collected the empty shells of the pistols which would be sent to the forensic division of the Sindh police.

ISLAMABAD: A year since new laws came into force aimed at stemming the flow of ""honour killings"", scores of young women in deeply conservative Pakistan are still being murdered by relatives for bringing shame on their family.

The shocking murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch by her brother last July turned the spotlight on an epidemic of so-called honour killings and sparked a fresh push to close loopholes allowing the killers to walk free.

Long-awaited legislation was finally passed three months later in a move cautiously hailed by women's rights activists.

But, more than a year on, lawyers and activists say honour killings are still occurring at an alarming pace.

At least 280 such murders were recorded by the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan from October 2016 to June of this year -- a figure believed to be underestimated and incomplete.

""There has been no change,"" Benazir Jatoi, a lawyer who works for the independent Aurat Foundation, a women's rights watchdog, told AFP.

""In fact, the Peshawar High Court twice acquitted a man of honour crimes after this law was passed,"" she added.

The new legislation mandates life imprisonment for honour killings, but whether a murder can be defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge's discretion.

That means the culprits can simply claim another motive and still be pardoned, said Dr Farzana Bari, a widely-respected activist and head of the Gender Studies Department at Islamabad's Quaid-i-Azam University.

They can do so under Pakistan's Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (retribution) law, which allows them to seek forgiveness from a victim's relatives -- a particularly convenient means of escape in honour cases.

Bari called for a study on the murders of women over the past year to ascertain the scale of the problem.

The convoluted courts system also often sees police encouraging parties to enter blood money compromises, circumventing the beleaguered judicial system altogether.

""Forgiveness and compromise negates justice,"" Jatoi said.

Asma Jahangir, one of Pakistan's most acclaimed human rights lawyers, agreed, telling AFP: ""The law will be implemented once the courts function.""

- 'Of course, I strangled her' -

The roots of ""honour"" killings lie in tribal social norms which remain prevalent across South Asia and dictate the behaviour of women in particular.

Women have been shot, stabbed, stoned, set alight and strangled for bringing ""shame"" on their families for everything from refusing marriage proposals to wedding the ""wrong"" man and helping friends elope.

Men can be victims too, but the violence is overwhelmingly aimed at women.

The double standard is glaring. Generally Pakistanis will accept a man who has committed rape, a senior police official who has overseen honour killing investigations told AFP.

But ""if a woman is even suspected of an affair it is considered a shame for the family and not forgiven,"" the official, who asked to remain anonymous as he was not authorised to speak to media, told AFP.

""People even sympathise (with) and praise the men who murder their women for so-called honour,"" he said.

Even when the state does take steps to implement the law -- as with the murder of Qandeel Baloch -- the wheels of justice often get stuck in the mud.

Baloch achieved notoriety in Pakistan with her social media antics, tame by Western standards but considered provocative in a misogynistic country where women have fought for their rights for decades.

Her brother Waseem told reporters that ""of course"" he had strangled his sister, finding her behaviour ""intolerable"".

At first, Baloch's heartbroken parents vowed they would give Waseem no absolution.

But well over a year later, the trial is still grinding its way through the courts.

This length of time is not unheard of for Pakistani murder cases, but it has been long enough -- as often happens -- for Baloch's father to change his mind.

""I want my son to return home,"" Mohammad Azeem told AFP near the central city of Multan recently, dismissing Waseem's proud statements. ""My son is innocent.""

Had international revulsion over the killing not seen the Pakistani state take the unprecedented step of declaring itself an heir alongside Baloch's parents, their forgiveness could have already seen Waseem walk free.

- Outdated, arbitrary, patriarchal code -

For Jatoi, the issue goes far beyond the courts -- from the elites, where the political leadership fails to understand the issue, to the rural masses, where illiteracy and poverty help perpetuate it.

Rights activists have called for change for years, and Pakistan's young, urbanised population often take to social media for campaigns such as last year's #NoMoreKillingGirls.

But Jatoi said Pakistan as a society has been unable to move past the meaning of ""honour"".

""Only when we widely condemn the act will we stop seeing proud murderers... telling of how they killed a woman because she breached an outdated, arbitrary, and patriarchal 'honour' code of which no one knows the rules.""",[],"But, more than a year on, lawyers and activists say honour killings are still occurring at an alarming pace.

Islamabad - At least three officials of Islamabad police have been suspended and detained at the Police Lines after some female constables alleged that their male colleagues sexually abused them on different occasions under the pretext of inquiries and explanations, official sources informed on Tuesday.

The three suspects including Ishaq, Orangzeb and Arshad have been detained (Quarter Guard) at the Police Lines and are being interrogated by the high ups. They would not be allowed to move anywhere until completion of investigation into the case, said the officials speaking on condition of anonymity. However, one senior officer nearing retirement, also accused of harassment has not been detained, according to the officials. They further said that more culprits may be identified as the investigation starts.

An anonymous letter supposedly written by the lady constables of Islamabad police went viral on Monday evening. Soon after the letter started circulating on social media, IG Islamabad police held a Darbar (Open Forum) at the Police Lines to listen to the grievances of the lady constables.

However, according to the official sources, no one amongst the lady constables stepped forward to repeat her allegations. The IGP, Sultan Azam Temuri however, appointed AIG (Operations) Asmatullah Junejo as an inquiry officer in the case.

The letter was addressed to Chief Justice of Pakistan, Chief Justice Islamabad High Court, Interior Minister, Chief Commissioner Islamabad and the IGP at the end of March 2018 with a request to take action against the culprits.

The female colleagues had alleged that the readers and operators of the senior police officers used to sexually abuse them on the occasion of their appearance before the high ups in connection with minor charges. “They would offer to settle the issue at their own against some favour”, the letter alleged. The letter also claimed that the victims have videos and photographs where the accused can be seen abusing their female colleagues. They alleged that DSP (Headquarters) and some of the readers and operators were involved in the dirty game.

The victims have sought help of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Justice Saqib Nisar to save their lot from sexual abuse at the hands of operators and readers of the police high-ups.

BERLIN - A German Catholic leader was forced to apologise Wednesday over comments that sparked indignation among the country’s Muslim community and proponents of a multicultural society.

Cologne Archbishop Joachim Meisner, 80, had praised the high birth rate of many Catholics, telling followers: “I always say, one of your families to me makes up for three Muslim families”.

Bekir Alboga of the Turkish-Islamic Union Ditib said the comments promote “fear and misunderstanding”, telling broadcaster Deutsche Welle that “we need a bridge-builder, not a polariser.”

Many politicians also strongly rejected the comments, among them Sylvia Loehrmann, state education minister of North Rhine-Westphalia where Cologne is located.

“Rating the relative value of families and therefore children by origin or religious affiliation not only violates our constitution, it is also anything but Christian,” she said.

The archbishop — who has in the past likened abortion to Nazi crimes — later said he regretted having caused “irritation” and that “it was not my intention to offend people of other faiths”.

“My choice of words in this case was perhaps unfortunate,” said Meisner, who is expected to retire next month.

CHICAGO - A weekend of bloodshed in Chicago left 11 people dead, including a nine-year-old boy, as police struggled to contain the gun violence plaguing the city in the US heartland.

The boy was killed while riding in an SUV with a 31-year-old man. A grey sedan pulled alongside and someone inside began shooting, according to police who did not identify either victim.

The older man was struck in the back, face and chest, and was in critical condition at a hospital, police said. The young boy died of a gunshot wound to the back.

The two were among 56 shot in the period between Friday afternoon and Monday morning, according to the Chicago Tribune newspaper, which keeps a running tally of the runaway shootings, which have been mostly gang-related and concentrated in a few economically struggling neighborhoods.

Eleven people in total were killed, the Tribune reported.

Chicago police, which do not include in its tally incidents that occur in the city but outside the department's jurisdiction, on Monday reported 35 shootings and 10 murders over the same weekend period.

Warm summer months often bring higher levels of violence to Chicago streets. Over the July 4 holiday, 101 were hit by gunfire and 14 killed, according to the Tribune. The youngest of the victims during that four-day period was just 13 years old, the newspaper said.

The violence has drawn a great deal of media attention because it is where former president Barack Obama worked as a civil rights attorney and law professor. Obama still maintains a high profile in the city, where his presidential library is to be built.

Other US cities such as St Louis or Baltimore have even higher murder rates relative to the size of their populations, but the sheer number of shootings in Chicago gets it noticed more.

The Drug Enforcement Agency recently announced that more agents would be sent to aid Chicago law enforcement, by forming a task force to battle the illicit drug trade, which fuels gun violence.",[],"Share:CHICAGO - A weekend of bloodshed in Chicago left 11 people dead, including a nine-year-old boy, as police struggled to contain the gun violence plaguing the city in the US heartland.

ISLAMABAD-Ministry of Human Rights on Friday held awareness session on child rights and prevention of child abuse in Sabzi Mandi, I-11, Islamabad for three child protection committees.

A statement released by the ministry said that to continue Minister of Human Rights Dr. Shireen Mazari’s mission to raise awareness of public about the rights of children and prevention from child abuse, the Ministry of Human Rights through its Human Rights Awareness Programme engaged three more child protection committees from Sabzi Mandi area, Meher Abadi and I-9 to inform them about the rights of children, and ways in which children can be protected from child abuse through community based measures.

The session was conducted at the Office of the Chairman, Market Committee, Sabzi Mandi I-11 Islamabad where the audience of 45 participants comprised of parents, civil society representatives, community leaders and media.

Director General (IC), Ministry of Human Rights, Hassan Ali Mangi shared his views on child rights saying that the society must follow the guidelines of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and treat its children with love and care.

He further said that it is the duty of parents, society and the government to provide a safe space for the growth of children. He further encouraged community representatives to hold dialogue with children about child abuse.

Adding to that he said that MoHR is committed to protect the rights of every child in Pakistan and the role of parents and teachers in sensitising them and raising awareness on self-protection. Discussion was based around the rights of children in the constitution of Pakistan, protection of child rights, role of MoHR and its pledge to protect the rights of every child in Pakistan.

Participants were enlightened to encourage children to speak out whenever they feel uncomfortable with anyone whether it’s the peer, family or someone at school. The members were also informed about newly passed bill of domestic labour under Schedule 1 of the Employment of Children Act 1991, in an effort to strengthen legislation pertaining to the issue as child domestic labour causes children physical, psychological, moral and social harm. The participants were encouraged to report cases on any kind of Child Abuse on the Ministry’s helpline 1099 which is easily accessible to everyone.

LUCKNOW : An Indian teenager died after allegedly being set on fire during an attack by four men when she went outside to relieve herself in the country’s east, police said Monday.

The family of the girl, thought to have been 17, has told police she was attacked on Saturday night when she went outside because her home in Uttar Pradesh state - like many in India - does not have a toilet. The girl was from India’s lowest Dalit caste. She had earlier been harassed by the attackers for using a mobile phone which they thought was immoral, a police officer said. The girl had argued back against the men’s directive to stop using the phone, her family told police.

“The girl’s father has accused (a man called) Mukesh and three others of killing his daughter by setting her on fire when she had gone out to answer nature’s call,” said SP Akhilesh Chaurasiya.

The girl was taken to hospital but died on Sunday from injuries sustained in the attack in Auraiya village, 100 miles (160 kilometres) from the state capital Lucknow.

Chaurasiya told AFP that initial criminal cases have been registered against all four men, who also belong to the Dalit caste. The leader of the group has fled the village, he said.

Men hold great sway over life in India’s rural, dirt-poor villages where unmarried women are encouraged to follow strict rules in a perceived bid to protect their modesty.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said last month that India should strive to ensure every household has a toilet within the next four years.

Almost half of India’s population defecates outside, according to experts, leaving women in particular exposed not only to disease but also harassment and assault.

The reported gang rape of a 19-year-old lower caste woman in the Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh has shaken the entire nation, and several politicians are seeking to visit the victim's family.

A man hurled ink at Delhi parliamentarian Sanjay Singh while he was addressing the media after meeting the family of an alleged gang-rape victim who is said to have been brutally assaulted by four upper caste men on 14 September.

The video of the incident has gone viral with over 45,000 views. It shows a man walking up to a group of media personnel surrounding the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and hurling ink at him.

The man, identified as Deepak Sharma, has been detained by police. He said the lawmaker's visit to Hathras was politically motivated, which made him throw ink at him.

Soon after being attacked, Singh tweeted that Uttar Pradesh State Chief Yogi Adityanath ""is not a Thakur (Upper caste community) but a coward and that he (Singh) would continue to fight for justice for the little girl"".

The four accused in the gang-rape of the Dalit (lower caste community) girl, also belong to the upper caste Thakur community.

The state chief, who has been under fire from opposition parties for his ""inefficient and insensitive"" handling of the case, has ordered a probe by India's top investigation agency Central Bureau of Investigation into the incident.
