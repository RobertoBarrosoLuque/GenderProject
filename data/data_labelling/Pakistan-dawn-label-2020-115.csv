A member of the Old Ravian Facebook group had posted screenshots and pictures of a teacher of the GCU Physics Department, and alleged quoting a student that she and her friends were repeatedly failed by the teacher in examinations and were also sexually harassed by him.

According to the Facebook post, the group member said he decided to speak on behalf of the student who alleged the teacher wanted to remain in contact with her and her friends.

In the post the teacher was accused of compelling the students to attend his video calls. It said that on Saturday, the teacher called one of the students who “decided to expose him” and took some screenshots in which he was “shirtless and apparently drunk”.

It says when the student turned off her Wi-Fi after taking the screenshots, the teacher started making calls on her mobile number and had sent messages asking her to attend the call.

The post includes call logs, messages and screenshots of video calls, demanding the Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Asghar Zaidi to take notice of the incident.

Meanwhile, the vice chancellor Prof Zaidi also received complaints about a faculty member of the university making inappropriate calls and messages to a female student and ordered an inquiry into the matter. For the purpose, he constituted a committee that also included a woman member.

He said that as a matter of principle harassment would not be tolerated at the GCU.

Prof Zaidi said a web portal (Vice Chancellor web portal) had been created by varsity since February 2020 for filing such complaints by students and staff.

He said the university would not further comment on this matter till conclusion of the inquiry.

He directed the probe committee to maintain the confidentiality of the matter and provide full protection to the complainant.

The launching ceremony, which was held at a local hotel, was attended among others by Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari and Federal Secretary for Human Rights, Rabiya Javeri Agha.

The videos will cover important topics including sexual harassment, rape, the marriage contract, filing an FIR and women’s inheritance.

The films have been developed in collaboration with the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) and Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy (SOC) Films. The Films will be available in Urdu, Sindhi, Pushto, Punjabi and Balochi languages.

In a statement, MoHR said that the films will be broadcast widely across social media that will be conducted throughout the 16 days of activism from Nov 25 to Dec 10.

The films will also be disseminated to numerous universities and colleges, as well as amongst the civil society to increase outreach.

Several radio shows are also being conducted with leading lawyers and human rights experts to generate greater awareness around these issues and stimulate discussion and dialogue at the grassroots level.

The Ministry of Human Rights said that it is also launching the 1099 helpline app, which has been developed in collaboration with UN Women to streamline and strengthen grievance redressal mechanisms against human rights violations, particularly with regards to gender-based violence and child abuse.

According to the MoHR, the app is already available for download on the Google Playstore, and apple store will also provide it early next month.

Since its launch in November 2018, the helpline has received over 450,000 calls, 49pc of them were related to women’s rights.

Addressing on the occasion Federal Secretary for Human Rights, Rabiya Javeri Agha, said the app would provide an alternative and effective mechanism to launch and track complaints related to human rights violations.

UN Women Country Representative Shameela Rasool said: “Violence against women and girls is a grave violation of basic human rights, globally affecting one in three women in her lifetime.”

She said survivors’ journey to access justice and reintegration into the society should be the measure of our success as support groups for the distressed.

UN Women is working closely with the Ministry of Human Rights for improving the lives of women and girls of Pakistan, be it through institutional strengthening and capacity building, technical assistance for implementing, monitoring and reporting on internal commitments, data collection, legislative reform and advocacy, or service delivery for survivors, she said.

Federal Minister for Human Rights Dr Shireen Mazari reiterated the importance of strengthening and supporting grievance redressal mechanisms.

“Last month, we also launched the Zainab Alert Mechanism on the Pakistan Citizen’s Portal as well as a community engagement campaign to raise awareness about the system, encouraging and increasing reporting of child abuse in Pakistan.

“The series of films and radio shows that we are holding for 16 days of activism against gender-based violence have the potential to educate women about their fundamental rights. With the additional launch of our 1099 helpline App, we are hopeful that the alarming figures related to gender-based violence and child abuse will steadily begin to drop.”

1016,29,54,https://www.dawn.com/news/1583926,10/8/20 13:58,"'Another Zainab': 2-year-old girl assaulted, tortured before being killed in Charsadda, say police","Inspector General of Police, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sanaullah Abbasi said on Thursday that suspects in a rape and murder case of a minor in Charsadda have been arrested but refused to share further details as it would ""affect the investigation"".

The IGP's statement came hours after Charsadda police said that the two-and-a-half-year-old girl Zainab, whose body was found in Jabba Korona area in the limits of Daudzai police station of Peshawar a day earlier, appeared to have been assaulted and tortured before being killed.

Residents and police said the minor girl had gone missing on Tuesday evening in Sheikh Kallay Qilla area while playing with other children outside her house.

On Wednesday, the Prang police got information about the body of a girl lying in Jabba Korona area. The Prang and Daudzai police recovered the body and shifted it to the Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar for postmortem.

District Police Officer (DPO) Charsadda Mohammad Shoaib Khan said that police had initially registered a first information report (FIR) in the Prang police station, Charsadda, against unknown kidnappers on the complaint of the girl's father.

Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) was added to the FIR after the body was found, he said.

Khan said that initial investigation ""suggests that the minor was assaulted before her murder"", adding that there were torture marks on the girl's body. Police were waiting for the medical report, after which they would add other sections of the PPC, he said.

According to IGP Abbasi, the DHQ hospital had ""verbally"" confirmed to the police that the victim was sexually assaulted before being killed but a formal post-mortem examination report is yet to be issued.

Zainab's father said that the family did not have enmity with anyone. He demanded that the government catch the culprit so he could ask him what his daughter had done to him that he committed such a crime.

""Today it is my Zainab, tomorrow another Zainab could suffer this,"" he lamented.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan took notice of the incident and directed the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Sanaullah Abbasi and other authorities to immediately arrest those involved.

""An example should be made out of them,"" he said and termed the incident ""heart-rending"".

The chief minister said the culprits would not be able to escape the reach of the law and the family would be provided complete justice.

IGP Abbasi also visited the victim's family and assured them that the police will soon arrest the culprits behind the heinous crime. Speaking to the media later, he said that the DPO was personally supervising the investigation of the case.

'Another Zainab'

Meanwhile, the hashtags #JusticeforZainab and #AnotherZainab were used on Twitter by netizens to express outrage over unabated cases of abuse and murder of children in the country.

Photos of the two-year-old's body were circulated on social media with many users comparing the incident to the 2018 rape and murder of 8-year-old Zainab Amin in Kasur.

Zainab Amin had gone missing on Jan 4, 2018 and five days later, a police constable deputed to trace the girl recovered her body from a heap of trash near the Shahbaz Khan Road.

Police said the girl seemed to have been killed four or five days earlier.

Being the 12th such incident to occur within a 10-kilometre radius in Kasur in one year, Zainab's rape and murder had sparked outrage and protests across the country.

Editorial: Rampant child abuse

The heinous nature of the crime had seen immediate riots break out in Kasur — in which two people were killed — while #JusticeforZainab became a rallying cry for an end to violence against children.

More than two years after the Zainab Amin case, the National Assembly passed the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Bill, 2019 that seeks to expedite investigation and punishment for perpetrators of child abuse.

The Sindh police also launched an indigenously-developed mobile phone application — the Zainab Alert Mobile App — that would help develop database of crimes against children, including registration of cases, progress on their investigations and police performance in the area.

However, violence against children has continued with as many as 1,489 children — at least eight per day — sexually abused in the first half of 2020 in Pakistan.

According to Sahil, an organisation working for child protection, the major categories in the cases included abduction (331), rape (160), sodomy (233), gang-rape (69) and gang-sodomy (104). Thirteen boys and 12 girls were murdered after sexual abuse while four boys and one girl were murdered after gang-rape.","['Sirajuddin', 'Dr. Salaria', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Imtiaz Hunzai', 'Berlin', 'Azam', 'Lars Stevens', 'Vivek Lahore', 'M.

1031,44,74,https://www.dawn.com/news/1559501,5/26/20 21:21,Kasur policeman arrested for allegedly killing teenaged boy for refusing relationship,"Khudian police have arrested a member of the Punjab Highway Patrol (PHP) police, who allegedly sexually harassed and later on Sunday shot dead an 18-year-old boy for allegedly refusing to have a relationship with him in Punjab's Kasur district, officials said on Tuesday.

The victim, who was shot dead near main Khudian bazaar in the limits of Khudian police station, is the son of a local prayer leader, on whose complaint a First Information Report (FIR) of the incident was registered.

Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar took notice of the incident and sought a report from the provincial police chief as outrage over the killing grew louder on social media. The chief minister, while condoling with the bereaved family, assured them of justice, according to reports.

The deceased was a Hafiz-e-Quran and a member of the Jamiat Ahle Hadith. The suspect, 30, is an official of the patrolling police who was posted at Noorpur police post at Deepalpur Road.

Both the victim and the suspect were stated to be fast friends and they reportedly had relations in the past, Station House Officer Mohammad Ashraf told Dawn.

The deceased's father stated in the complaint that the suspect stopped his son at the corner of an alley while the latter was walking to a mosque for Fajr prayers on Eid day. The suspect threatened the teenager with his gun and warned that he would kill him if he (the deceased) did not agree to have sexual relations with him, the FIR said.

After the victim turned down the suspect's overture, the police official allegedly opened fire on him, resulting in an injury, according to the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.

The complainant, who was nearby, said he and some other people tried to catch the suspect but he fled the scene while brandishing his weapon.

The injured victim was rushed to the Kasur District Headquarters Hospital where doctors referred him to Lahore General Hospital in critical condition. He later succumbed to his injuries at the Lahore hospital.

Police arrested the suspect soon after the incident and started an investigation into the case from various angles.

Police officials said investigators will also look beyond the details in the FIR to dispense justice and claimed that the incident had nothing to do with any sect or religious element.","['Afzal Ansari', 'T D', 'Adnan Mazher Khan', 'Azam', 'Imtiaz Ali Khan', 'Seshagiri Rao', 'Asif', 'A.

1035,48,81,https://www.dawn.com/news/1535726,2/21/20 7:01,‘Honour’ in shame,"A RECENT report by the Sindh Police has put into perspective the extent to which our society — including the criminal justice system itself — continues to justify, condone and encourage violence against women under the guise of tradition and faith. According to the report, in the past five years, 510 women and 259 men have been murdered in cold blood on the pretext of ‘honour’ across the province. Out of the total number of cases, 649 reached the police. However, only 19 cases — a paltry 2pc — resulted in awarding of punishment to perpetrators. The courts acquitted the suspects in 136 other cases, while the remaining 494 cases still await trial. Though these figures might reflect only a fraction of the actual number of such murders, they are enough to expose our hypocrisy. We have laws but little to no implementation. Those who make these laws are often found advocating for or even participating in the very ‘traditions’ that violate women’s right to life and bodily autonomy. Members of the public want rule of law, yet many end up pardoning family members who murder female relatives. Worse still are those who twist a religion that considers murder as among the greatest of sins in order to justify killing women.

It is hardly surprising, then, that this dissonance reflects in the anti-‘honour’ killing law enacted in 2016. Though a major achievement in symbolic terms, as a legal instrument, it represents only an incremental step towards justice for those killed in the name of ‘honour’. The criminal amendment still permits family members of victims to ‘forgive’ their killers, while leaving it at the courts’ discretion to award punishment despite such pardons. Such a loophole — one among many — allows for the subjective interpretation and application of the law by police officers, prosecutors and judges alike. The report highlights these legal lacunae, along with faulty investigations, as well as collusion between prosecutors, witnesses and suspects, as being the main reasons behind the low conviction rate in ‘honour’ killings.

Besides, passing legislation is hardly enough to effect change in societal attitudes and break the vicious cycle of gender-based violence. Apart from improving the law and sensitising agents of the justice system, there is a dire need for comprehensive community outreach to combat the tacit acceptance of such ‘traditions’ in our society. In this regard, the media — particularly the Sindhi media — has played a commendable role, first by exposing and then continuing to shine a spotlight on such grotesque crimes. But the media’s job is only to inform, and change is only possible if the state proactively assumes its responsibility to vigorously prosecute and punish perpetrators as well as their abettors. Continued apathy in this regard only serves to endorse anti-women practices such ‘honour’ killings, which are in total violation of fundamental rights enshrined in our Constitution.

1052,65,103,https://www.dawn.com/news/1584044,10/9/20 7:15,"Repeated incidents of child abuse warrant greater action from state, society","KARACHI: Another city; another missing child; another garbage heap; another dead body. Same crime: kidnapping, rape and murder.

A five-year-old girl goes missing on September 4, 2020 this time in Karachi. She is kidnapped, raped and murdered and her body found on a garbage heap. This time the body has been torched.

News of this incident spreads via social media and once again ignites protests. People demand justice for this child and others like her.

Crimes against children are increasing in Pakistan. According to Sahil’s — a non-government organisation — cruel numbers, child sexual abuse has increased by 14 per cent.

In the NGO’s Six Months Cruel Numbers Report the number of child abuse cases reported between January to June this year is 1,489 out of which 53pc were girls and 47pc boys and that more than eight children were abused daily during the first six months of the year. According to the report, 32pc of these cases were reported in Sindh.

CM’s law adviser says legislation proposed to create database of habitual offenders

However, the number of cases only includes the ones reported. The actual number is probably higher.

The main reason for this, as Aamna Latif of Aahung, an NGO working to improve sexual and reproductive health and rights said in an email to Dawn, is “The culture of guilt and shame associated with the body that is inculcated in children since a young age (amongst other factors), you would agree that there is under-reporting of sexual abuse, so numbers are actually much higher than this.”

There are laws in Sindh that provide protection to children but lack of awareness and implementation makes them useless. Ms Latif says, “Under the Sindh Child Protection Authority Act 2011, the Sindh Child Protection Authority was established which boasts Child Protection Units in 29 districts of Sindh. They claim to have rescued about 1,000 children all over the province over the last year, and provided legal aid to them via special courts.”

‘Habitual offenders & weakness of justice system’

Recently, Barrister Murtaza Wahab, adviser to the CM on law, expressed grave concern over rising incidents of crimes against children, especially child disappearances and abuse.

Commenting on the matter, Mr Wahab told Dawn: “The real change or effective curb on such crimes will only happen once we have the people accused of such offences convicted. No deterrence can be created without stringent punishment to the wrongdoers. Unfortunately, people involved in such crimes including the ones against women are usually habitual offenders and the recent Motorway incident again shows weakness of our criminal justice system that the person who allegedly committed the act was earlier involved in similar offences.”

Speaking about reforms, Mr Wahab said, “We need reforms for expediting the trial of such cases. Government of Sindh (GoS) wants to push a new law which would have shortened processes and hopefully once passed by Assembly we would require the Courts to implement it.

“Once we have courts deciding these matters fast it would lead to the following: A) deterring the criminals because of fear of conviction; B) having a database of such habitual offenders so that they can be effectively tracked and traced; C) social issues with family being reluctant to report such crimes would also be sorted,” he added.

Mr Wahab thinks that there is a need to “Encourage families to report. Right now the families, due to various reasons, are not encouraged to report such matters. CPA law needs certain amendments which I am taking to the Assembly.”

At present, the Sindh government has a child helpline, 1121.

Speaking about this, Mr Wahab said, “There is a helpline for child issues which is functional but it needs more awareness. Moreover, the 15 mechanism of Sindh police also needs to be used by families as and when any child goes missing.”

But things are being done at a very slow pace which is why some people have begun taking initiative themselves to protect children by creating safe environments for minors.

Tasneem Ashraf, an educationist, teacher trainer and supervisor at a day care centre says: “We are so careful about children’s safety that we tell parents that if the child is going to be picked by a driver, uncle or anyone he will not be allowed to carry the child physically unless the child is under one year.”

Ms Ashraf added that “I take immediate action if I see anyone carry a child who is capable of walking. Once I saw a driver pick a child and carry her to the car. I called the mother and told her that we do not allow children to be carried like this, even if the person is reliable. And she should also make sure this does not happen.”

However people taking up the responsibility is not enough. The government also needs to take responsibility and take steps to make the province safer for children. And also to ensure that laws are easily implemented and speedy action is taken after a crime is committed.

Currently there is a vacuum, as the government is unable or unwilling to do its part to protect children. Fortunately, NGOs have stepped in and are providing information, legal support and even shelters to those who need them. Perhaps the government can get its act together and set up a workable system with help from these organizations by adopting their existing structures.

“Aahung has a referral system where we pass on information to survivors of sexual abuse for them to be able to seek physical, psychological and legal recourse,” Aamna Latif says.

“There are a few civil society organisations who have independent shelter homes for women and children who are victims of abuse. These are, again, not long-term solutions. However, there are no such places of refuge which are government-run. They largely exist on paper — are budgeted for and misallocated.”

The federal and provincial governments can learn from these NGOs.

Recommendations

A good place to begin would be to consider these recommendations given by Aahung.

The state must introduce Child Protection via Life Skills Based Education (LSBE) in all schools with parent education being a critical aspect. Children must be taught in school how to identify and protect themselves from abuse as well as how to respect others and prevent themselves from becoming abusers. School LSBE programmes must also engage and sensitise parents to identify signs of abuse and support their children in feeling safe and confident about reporting abuse.

The state must launch regular mass awareness campaigns through media for parents, law enforcement agencies and healthcare providers to listen to children and support them, an essential social pre-requisite for justice.

The state must establish special police units at the district level with male and female officers trained to deal sensitively with cases of child sexual abuse. Additionally, all police stations need to be equipped with rape kits and forensic lab support within their province.

The state must activate and mobilise their Child Protection Units in every province, and within each province ensure their presence in every district. Child protection institutions (CPIs) practicing alternative family-based care must (a) rescue and protect children, specially survivors of child sexual abuse, when families are not safe and (b) also monitor any institutions interacting with children and hold them accountable as per law.

The state must establish specific child-friendly courts to ensure that child survivors get access to sensitive justice.

The state must invest in ensuring an increase in the number of women in the police force, in the legal profession (as lawyers and prosecutors) and mandate an increase in the number of female judges and female medico-legal officers.

The state must provide free legal aid to survivors of child sexual abuse.

The state must provide free counselling and therapy for survivors of child sexual abuse by specially trained therapists.

The state must mandate hospitals, clinics and health units to provide awareness to and train and sensitise healthcare providers to provide appropriate care to survivors of child sexual abuse.

Finally, the state must establish strong linkages between relevant departments including education, child welfare, police and health, as well as the civil society voices, especially child rights organisations to build a coordinated approach to end violence against children.

1105,118,202,https://www.dawn.com/news/1557803,5/17/20 21:06,Two men arrested for killing 2 teenage girls for 'honour' in Waziristan village,"North Waziristan police on Sunday arrested two men for their alleged involvement in the ""honour killing"" of two teenage girls after a short mobile video of them with a young man surfaced on social media.

The Razmak police station in North Waziristan, in whose jurisdiction the murders were reported, on Friday had registered an FIR of the incident with the state as the complainant and had started an investigation.

According to the FIR, the incident had taken place on May 14 around 2pm at Shaam Plain Garyom, a border village of North and South Waziristan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

""A confirmed report was received that two girls aged 16 and 18 were killed in the name of honour by their paternal cousin, whose name and address is not known, in Shaam Plain Garyom,"" the FIR had said.

It had added that the reason behind the killings was believed to be a video which showed a young man recording himself with three young girls in a secluded area outdoors.

""The arrests were made during a raid at a far-flung area in the jurisdiction of Razmak police station,"" an official told Dawn.com today, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

The suspects are related to the victims; one is the father of the first girl while the other is the brother of the second girl, he said, adding that the culprits have been shifted to Razmak police station.

""Initial investigations show that the suspects opened fire on the victims over the video scandal,"" the official said. Further investigations are under way, he added.

According to the official, both the suspects told police that the victims were killed and buried in their native village.

""The suspects will be presented before a judge for their judicial remand,"" the official added.

Another police official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told Dawn.com that North and South Waziristan police were conducting a joint investigation. ""However, at this point officials are clueless about the third girl and the man who recorded the mobile video,"" he said.

On Saturday, a senior police officer in Waziristan had confirmed the incident and said that two of the three girls seen in the 52-second mobile clip had been killed. He had said that police were collecting information about the third girl and the man seen in the video.

The official had said that the video in question was shot nearly a year ago and most probably went viral on social media a few weeks ago.

“As per the information received by police so far, the third girl and the boy are alive,” the officer had said while quoting a report by the area tehsildar.

“At the moment, our topmost priority is to secure the life of the third girl and the man before taking any action,"" he had added.","['Jai Moolchandani', 'Paggri Sambhal', 'S.

1115,128,215,https://www.dawn.com/news/1581140,9/23/20 7:08,Missing Sikh girl reunited with family in Attock,"TAXILA: A 22-year-old Sikh girl, who recently went missing under mysterious circumstances from her home, was reunited with her family on Tuesday, proving that theories about her abduction as well as forced conversion were mere propaganda, police sources said.

The girl went missing in Attock district’s Hassanabdal city, which is home to famous Sikh temple Gurdwara Punja Sahib, at around 10pm on Aug 31.

Her father, in his FIR lodged with the Hassanabdal police station, said his daughter had gone to a dump garbage in the street at 10pm on Aug 31, but did not return home.

He said that when the family couldn’t find her, he lodged a complaint with the Hassan­abdal police station which subsequently registered a case under Section 365-B of the Pakistan Penal Code for kidnapping, abduction or inducing a woman to marry, and launched a hunt for the missing girl.

During the investigation, the police zeroed in on one suspect who was released after initial questioning. The family expressed fears that she might have converted to Islam and married a Muslim man.

However, all such fears proved to be baseless when the girl was reunited with her family at the Attock district police office. The young woman in her video statement raised Sikh religious slogans, along with her family, including father and mother. “Jo bolay so Nehal, Sat Sari Akal,” they chanted.

The Indian media had played up the issue and termed the incident “a case of forced conversion”. The Indian media’s fake propaganda triggered demonstrations staged by some Sikh organisations such as Delhi’s Shiromani Akali Dal Unit and Delhi’s Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee outside the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi against the alleged kidnapping.

Moreover, according to media reports, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs also summoned an official of the Pakistan High Commission over the issue.

In his statement, the father, who runs a herbal shop in Hassanabdal, thanked the government and Attock police for the safe and early recovery of his missing daughter. He said he was happy that his daughter was safely reunited with her family with her religion intact.

Representatives of the Sikh community also lauded efforts of the police and support of the federal and provincial governments as well as the Evacuee Trust Property Board and the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee for making untiring efforts for the safe and early recovery of the girl.

Talking to Dawn, District Police Officer Syed Khalid Hamdani said that police teams’ weeks-long efforts proved fruitful and the Sikh girl was safely handed over to her father and mother after fulfilling legal requirements as she recorded her statement in a local court under Section 166 on Tuesday.

Police said the suspect was joking with his aunt over some issue when his uncle asked him not to do so.","['block', 'boys', 'murdered', 'suspect', 'later', 'road', 'body', 'aunt', 'protest', 'culprits', 'cousin', 'boy', 'airport', 'family']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189f00b83e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0d52ba8a43.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21824a8678.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189916390d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0ec56aad75.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd22283a73d3.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18a3ece187.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1b7a7c513c.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1b8a1c9e06.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f94d8916a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f4142e469.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24c3aad888.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24e90196c5.jpg', 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}",TRUE,http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'RAWALPINDI: Family members of the 11-year-old boy whose body was found on Thursday and a large number of residents ...', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1537248', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Murdered boy’s family block Airport Road', 'description': 'RAWALPINDI: Family members of the 11-year-old boy whose body was found on Thursday and a large number of residents ...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1537248', 'title': 'Murdered boy’s family block Airport Road', 'description': 'RAWALPINDI: Family members of the 11-year-old boy whose body was found on Thursday and a large number of residents ...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-02-29 07:05:39', 'modified_time': '2020-02-29 07:05:39', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/397/the-newspaper-s-staff-reporter'}, 'author': ""The Newspaper's Staff Reporter""})",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dawn,,2020-02-29
1124,137,230,https://www.dawn.com/news/1548550,4/12/20 7:01,Forced conversions,"OVER the years, the laws applicable to the rights of religious minorities in Pakistan have shifted from being neutral to blatantly discriminatory — from electoral laws, family laws, law on evidence, Hudood laws, redistribution of income through Zakat and Ushr, trust and evacuee property laws, domicile and nationality, to offences against religion.

The discrimination against women belonging to religious minority groups is worse; they become victims of rape, abduction, forced marriage and forced conversion. That it is largely underage girls who are ‘converting’ to Islam speaks volumes of the vulnerability of the converts, and the motivation of those behind the conversion.

Twice the Sindh government attempted to outlaw forced conversions and marriages, including laying guidelines for the court process in the Protection of Minorities Bill, placing an age limit of 18 years upon conversions and enabling better due process. In 2016, the bill was unanimously passed by the Sindh Assembly, but religious parties objected to an age limit for conversions, and threatened to besiege the assembly if the bill received approval of the governor, who then refused to sign the bill into law.

In 2019, a revised version was introduced, but religious parties protested once again. A sit-in was organised by Pir Mian Abdul Khaliq (Mian Mithu), a political and religious leader and a central character in many cases of forced conversions of underage Hindu girls in Sindh. He and his group claim the girls are not forced, but fall in love with Muslim men and convert willingly. In March 2019, nearly 2,000 Hindus staged a sit-in to demand justice for two sisters, Reena and Raveena, who they claimed were forcibly converted and married. The Islamabad High Court ruled the girls had willingly converted and married the men. Herein lies the contention. While there are a large number of cases of forced conversions and marriages, there are also cases where vulnerable young women are preyed upon by influential men who entice them to convert and marry. To what extent can the law differentiate coercion from peaceful persuasion, and could enticement without the threat of violence become punishable?

It is largely underage girls who are ‘converting’.

Pakistan is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states that the right to freedom of religion includes the right to change one’s religion and that no one shall be subject to coercion to change their religion. The European Court of Human Rights has given some guidance regarding the distinction between permissible religious persuasion, on the one hand, and coercion on the other.

According to case law, exploiting a position of power to entice vulnerable people or subordinates to convert amounts to coercion, which should be outlawed. The fact that the default legal system in Pakistan is discriminatory, particularly towards women from religious minorities, coupled with the clout and resources of those preying upon them, implies coercion and urgently requires positive legislation to safeguard vulnerable citizens.

Further, once the women convert, there is no going back, as apostasy would mean a death sentence. In many cases, women are also told that their families are ‘kafirs’ and they cannot meet them. This impedes their access to justice as they remain in the clutches of powerful men. No one hears from these women directly after they ‘elope’. Reena and Raveena’s parents are right to question why they suddenly decided to marry men who already had wives and children.

The Peoples Commission for Minorities’ Rights and the Centre for Social Justice compiled the data of 156 incidents of forced conversions which took place between 2013 and 2019. A vast majority of the girls are minors, with numerous cases of girls as young as 12 years old. Religious groups oppose a minimum age for conversion or marriage on the basis that this is not sanctioned by Islam. Since Sindh has outlawed the marriage of girls under 18, underage girls are taken to Punjab in some cases, where they are married.

Sexual intercourse with a girl below the age of 16 is statutory rape and carries a death sentence, or a minimum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment. There is no defence. Yet in some cases, the production of a conversion certificate and a nikahnama influences law enforcement to pardon the abductors.

Pakistan has failed to comply with its international obligations to protect non-Muslim women and girls from exploitation by powerful groups and criminal elements. Even worse is the psychological impact on families of minorities who worry when their daughters venture out, and the culture of intolerance that is promoted when leaders like Mian Mithu celebrate another ‘conversion’ and marriage as a victory for the Muslim faith in the local community. It sends a chilling message to our most vulnerable people — that their girls are not safe.

1150,163,273,https://www.dawn.com/news/1594881/underage-marriage-court-orders-arzoos-purported-husband-be-tried-for-rape,12/9/20 21:47,Underage marriage: Court orders Arzoo’s purported husband be tried for rape,"A judicial magistrate on Wednesday invoked offence of rape against the main suspect in a case pertaining to the alleged underage marriage of Arzoo — a teenage Christian girl who was allegedly abducted before being forcefully converted and married to a Muslim man.

The judge also ordered the registration of a case against Syed Ali Azhar, who is the girl's purported husband, as well as against cleric Qazi Abdul Rasool Naqshbandi, the justice of peace and facilitators and witnesses under Section 3 of the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act, 2013.

The magistrate also issued non-bailable arrest warrants for the absconding suspects. The judge sent the matter to the district and sessions’ judge (South) for initiating a trial.

During the hearing, the judge ruled that the investigation officer in the case was at liberty to determine the question of the issuance of sanad (certificate of conversion of religion) in accordance with the Supreme Court’s judgment (SCMR-474 of 2014), which was raised by the complainant’s counsel during the course of the arguments.

Police had booked Azhar, his brothers Syed Mohsin Ali and Syed Shariq Ali and their friend Danish for allegedly kidnapping the teenage girl, forcibly converting her and marrying her to a Muslim man.

Officials had also booked cleric Qazi Abdul Rasool, Junaid Ali Siddiqui and Mehmood Hassan for facilitating and solemnising the underage marriage of Arzoo Raja with Azhar. They are all currently on interim pre-arrest bail while Azhar is in police custody.

On Wednesday, judicial magistrate (South) Muhammad Ali Dall pronounced his verdict on the charge-sheet filed by the investigating officer after hearing arguments from the state prosecutor, defence counsel Muhammad Nizar Tanoli and the counsels for the complainant, Jibran Nasir and Asghar Narejo.

In his 20-page order, the judge noted that from perusal of the material available on record, it appeared that the ""ingredients"" of Section 376 (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Section 3 of the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act, 2013 were ""attracting"" against the suspect Syed Ali Azhar.

Section 3 states: “Whoever, being a male above eighteen years of age, contracts a child marriage shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment, which may extend to two years or with fine, which may extend to one hundred thousand rupees or with both.”

Similarly, the judge said that ""ingredients"" of Section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) of the PPC also ""attracted"" against Azhar.

He further wrote that in view of the facts, it appeared that ""ingredients"" of Section 4 (punishment for solemnising a child marriage) of the Child Marriage Act was ""attracting"" against Qazi Abdul Rasool Naqshbandi, who solemnised the couple’s marriage, Justice of Peace Muhammad Azharuddin, witnesses Muhammad Danish, Habib, Mahmood Hassan and Junaid Ali Siddiqui.

The magistrate accepted the charge-sheet filed by the investigation officer and took cognisance under Section 376 of the PPC and Section 3 of the SCMRA, 2013 against Azhar.

The magistrate also took cognisance under the Section 4 of the SCMRA, 2013 against the cleric Qazi Abdul Rasool Naqshbandi, Justice of Peace Muhammad Azharuddin, Muhammad Danish, Habib, Mahmood Hassan and Junaid Ali Siddiqui.

The judge further took cognisance under Section 201 of the PPC against Azhar.

However, the judge noted that since no evidence for initiating trial is available against the suspects Syed Shariq Ali and Danish, both were discharged from the case accordingly for the time being.

“Let the case be registered against Syed Ali Azhar, Qazi Abdul Rasool Naqshbandi, Justice of Peace Muhammad Azharuddin, Mahmood Hassan and Junaid Ali Siddiqui.” The magistrate sent the record of proceedings of the case to the District and Sessions’ Judge (South) for initiating trial.

Meanwhile, the court issued non-bailable warrants for the arrest of the absconding suspects, the Justice of Peace Muhammad Azharuddin and witnesses of the marriage ceremony, Danish and Habib.","['Naeem Sahoutara', 'Chrís Dăń', 'Bhai Saha', 'A Pakistani', 'Ali Mehdi', 'N.

Talha of Ravi Town had died on July 27, two days after he was declared a suspected case of polio. The National Institute of Health (NIH) and the Punjab health authorities confirmed it on Saturday while officially notifying the death.

Earlier, 26-month-old Muhammad Ali had died of the disease at Children Hospital on July 14, an official privy to the information told Dawn.

This was the third death from polio in Punjab, which was also confirmed by the provincial government in a statement issued late on Saturday.

One of his immediate contacts also found infected with virus

The official said that all four limbs of Ali were paralysed and he had suffered a stroke which led to his death.

He was also a resident of Ravi Town, a health department spokesman, told Dawn.

He said Talha’s death was officially confirmed after health teams traced two minor girls, who were his immediate contacts, and found one of them infected with the same virus.

Referring to the NIH report, the spokesperson said that when Talha was shifted to the Government Said Mitha Hospital here on July 25, doctors declared him a suspected patient of poliovirus.

“The child was fine till he developed fever along with vomiting followed by gradual weakness of both the lower limbs,” the report reads.

It stated that the boy was later notified as suffering from Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) with provisional diagnosis of Guillain Barre Syndrome, the most common cause of AFP in healthy infants and children.

He was shifted to Mayo Hospital where his condition became critical due to difficulty in breathing and the weakness in upper limbs progressed, the report further stated. Talha was then shifted to the Covid-19 intensive care unit and placed on a ventilator where he died on July 27.

Meanwhile, health teams managed to trace the immediate contacts of Talha -- Noor Fatima and her younger sister from Ravi Town. The NIH report stated that Noor Fatima was fully immunised and had received the last dose of polio vaccine on March 18; the girls did not have a significant travel history. It, however, confirmed that she carried the poliovirus in her body, while the test reports of her sister were awaited.

Earlier on July 9, a six-month-old boy had succumbed to the disease in Taunsa Sharif.

Polio campaigns had remained suspended for three months due to Covid-19. However, the Punjab polio programme in-charge, Sundas Irshad, said in a statement on Saturday: “As a response, polio campaigns have been restarted to save more children from the virus. Monthly campaigns will ensure that the virus is eliminated this year.”

She urged parents to get their children vaccinated.

1206,219,349,https://www.dawn.com/news/1535295,2/19/20 7:09,"510 women, 259 men fell prey to ‘honour’ killing during five years in Sindh","As many as 769 people, including 510 females, fell victim to killings in the name of so-called honour in Sindh between 2014 and 2019, according to a recent police study.

Police presented charge sheets in 649 cases and the courts awarded sentences to accused in 19 of those cases. Accused in 136 cases have been acquitted and 494 cases are still pending trial.

The conviction rate stood at a mere two per cent against the acquittal rate of 20.9pc.

The study was conducted about cases pertaining to karo-kari, or honour killings, in Sindh.

Inspector General of Police Dr Syed Kaleem Imam told Dawn that as compared to lower Sindh where suicide cases were growing, upper Sindh was suffering from the phenomenon of so-called honour killing mainly because of existence of tribal culture there.

Of the total 649 criminal cases, courts hand sentences in only 19 cases between 2014 and 2019

He said that the police had decided to register cases on behalf of the state to prevent out-of-court settlements of such murders.

The police chief said that sometimes such killings also triggered a law and order problem because of the tribal factor.

He said that the study was carried out by the research wing of the Sindh police to identify the factors and suggest measures to control the killings in the name of so-called honour.

According to the police study, “Once a woman is declared as a kari, family members consider themselves to be authorised to kill her and the co-accused karo in order to restore family honour.”

A host of causes or motives have been cited in the study for the unabated killings such as elopement, refusal of an arranged marriage, being the victim of sexual assault or rape, seeking divorce from an abusive husband, committing adultery, alleged illicit relationship and flirting.

Other contributory factors are economic issues, preserving family land, allegation against some rich person, taking custody of the property of the enemy, settlement of a family dispute, old enmity, murder of enemy by alleging/declaring him as karo and practice of paying bride price, etc.

Loopholes in laws

Certain amendments were introduced in relevant laws in 2004 through the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act such as increasing the punishments, allowing courts to award punishment on account of principle of causing fasad fil ard (chaos or disorder in society) when the right of qisas has been waived or compounded and giving a minimum imprisonment for 10 years in case of honour crimes.

Other amendments in the laws related to removing the possibility of the murderer as being the Wali and allowing the state to take the responsibility of Wali if necessary.

The police study suggested that still there were certain loopholes in the said law like validity of the provisions of waiver in cases of honour crimes and leaving the punishment in honour crimes at the discretion of the court as punishment was not made mandatory.

Moreover, others who were usually involved in or validate such killings like jirgas, panchayats, etc, were not made equally liable to penalty under the law.

Faulty investigations, non-reporting of crime

The study cited several factors behind the failures to eliminate the heinous crime such as existence of centuries-old practices, deeply rooted socio-cultural factors, non-reporting of such cases or presenting the same as suicide or accidental death and silent social acceptance of such killings.

Other contributory factors were loopholes in the laws, faulty investigation, very low rate of conviction, ineffective deterrence of the law and criminal justice system, collusion between offenders and witnesses and unwillingness to implement the law due to the overwhelming social acceptance of the crime and the influence of power holders.

Moreover, majority of the cases were being settled out of court.

The police believed that the role of community also did not help to end such killings.

The community members were also seen allegedly pressurising and taunting men to control their family.

The police regretted that the murderers were being treated with “respect, seen as the custodians and protectors of honour” as there was a general disrespect for legal institutions.

Speedy justice, training of police suggested

The police believed that desirable results may not be achieved to eliminate this centuries-old practice having deeply rooted socio-cultural basis till formulating and implementing a comprehensive strategy comprising sustained educational and awareness campaigns, filling the loopholes of existing laws and then implementation of law in letter and spirit by all stakeholders of government and civil society.

The study also suggests that the punishments should not be mitigated under the defence of “grave and sudden provocation”.

The study also calls for elimination of a parallel judicial system, provision of speedy justice in honour-killing cases, training of police on the latest methods of investigation and developing a community outreach programme to provide shelter and protection to women who survive possible murders after being declared kari.

It has also been recommended to prepare a standardised format for registering FIRs, which should include questions specifically relating to honour killings and registration of all cases of killings on behalf of the state in order to make such offence non-compoundable.

The media is also urged not to just report the honour-killing cases, but also provide details about the law and its implications.

The media is also urged not to just report the honour-killing cases, but also provide details about the law and its implications.","['study', 'state', '510', 'prey', 'fell', 'factors', 'cases', 'sindh', 'laws', 'killings', 'men', '259', 'women', 'honour', 'killing', 'family', 'law']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/09/5d9176cf33534.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/02/5e4cb14fca295.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/05/5ce494d6aa0fa.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2016/10/57f4d27478e72.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/05/5ce494d6aa0fa.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/10/57f4d27478e72.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/09/5d9176cf33534.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/02/5e4cb14fca295.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd306ee076b9.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/02/5e4cb14fca295.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Of the total 649 criminal cases, courts hand sentences in only 19 cases between 2014 and 2019.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1535295', 'type': 'article', 'title': '510 women, 259 men fell prey to ‘honour’ killing during five years in Sindh', 'description': 'Of the total 649 criminal cases, courts hand sentences in only 19 cases between 2014 and 2019.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/02/5e4cb14fca295.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1535295', 'title': '510 women, 259 men fell prey to ‘honour’ killing during five years in Sindh', 'description': 'Of the total 649 criminal cases, courts hand sentences in only 19 cases between 2014 and 2019.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/02/5e4cb14fca295.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-02-19 07:09:31', 'modified_time': '2020-02-19 09:04:44', 'tag': 'Violence against women', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/1200/imtiaz-ali'}, 'keywords': 'Violence against women', 'news_keywords': 'Violence against women', 'author': 'Imtiaz Ali'})",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dawn,,2020-02-19
1263,276,430,https://www.dawn.com/news/1576805,8/28/20 14:43,Teacher found guilty of sexually harassing students at Lahore college,"LAHORE: A fact-finding committee has found a teacher of the Government College University (GCU) guilty of sexually harassing female students.

A member of the Old Ravian Facebook group had posted screenshots and pictures of a teacher of the GCU Physics Department and alleged [quoting a student] that she and her friends were repeatedly failed by the teacher in examinations and were also sexually harassed by him.

The Facebook group member said he decided to speak on behalf of the student who alleged that the teacher wanted to remain in contact with her and her friends.

In the post, the teacher was accused of compelling the students to attend his video calls and one of the students decided to expose him and took some screenshots in which he was shirtless and apparently drunk. The student turned off her Wi-Fi after taking the screenshots while the teacher started making calls on her mobile number and had sent messages asking her to attend the call. The post includes call logs, messages and screenshots of video calls, demanding that Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Asghar Zaidi take notice of the incident. The administration had suspended the teacher after the complaint was lodged against him in July 2020.

Prof Zaidi had ordered an inquiry into the sexual harassment complaint made on behalf of a student against a teacher of Physics Department and constituted a committee that also included a woman member.

On Thursday, the committee had submitted its report to the vice chancellor after a thorough investigation into the allegations.

The teacher was accused of sending ‘immoral’ messages [on WhatsApp] to female students and making video calls as well in inappropriate dress.

Prof Zaidi told Dawn that the committee had submitted its report.

“The report will be forwarded to the anti harassment committee to recommend imposition of penalty on the teacher,” he said.

The VC said the teacher was suspended for all types of duties soon after the filing of complaints against him. Prof Zaidi said the anti-harassment committee would submit its recommendations within a week.

“Action under PEEDA Act will also be taken against the teacher as he is found guilty of harassment,” he said.

The GCU had also terminated a teacher from service on similar charges two years ago.

1265,278,435,https://www.dawn.com/news/1552827,4/28/20 5:16,Policing Covid-19,"THE coronavirus pandemic has assigned more responsibilities and roles to police. Globally, the police are making changes in operational strategies and reallocating whatever human and financial resources they have at their disposal. However, an effective response requires far more, including: additional funds, enlistment of volunteers, active communication strategies, optimum use of technology, drafting of SOPs, improved institutional coordination, and strengthening of community networks.

The enormity of the crisis has convinced governments to introduce stricter laws and regulations. To enforce lockdown, for instance, France planned deployment of 100,000 policemen and establishment of fixed checkpoints. In Italy, violators of the curfew face a three-month imprisonment or a fine of 206 euros. To monitor social distancing, Italy also approved the use of drones by police.

In Norway, a 20,000 kroner fine or 15-day imprisonment was announced for those breaking self-quarantine rules. Though Pakistan also introduced self-quarantine and isolation measures, Norway adopted all these with legal and administrative backup. Any Norwegian who travelled abroad in recent weeks has to self-isolate for 14 days, and anyone who has been in close contact with a confirmed Covid-19 patient must undergo self-isolation for two weeks. In Denmark, police send text messages to mobile subscribers as a reminder to abide by the instructions.

In the UK, police will be authorised to use force to send people back home to self-isolate during lockdown. The London Metropolitan Police requested officers who retired within the last five years to rejoin the force, either on a voluntary or paid basis. Those close to retirement have been instructed to delay their departure. In Pakistan, however, the majority of those who retire at the age of 60 face health complications, so it is difficult to replicate such initiatives here.

The police are in a better position to act as first responders.

Another concern is how to police the cyberspace. Malaysia and Singapore have clamped down on online misinformation about the coronavirus, and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commis­sion arrested some suspects for spreading misinformation about the outbreak.

The gravity of the situation in Pakistan suggests that, through criminal justice measures, self-isolation instructions need to be clearly specified. Without incorporating crisis management functions into the law, along with updated training modules and exclusive allocation, the police will be reduced to the status of a spectator or reporting agency.

Initially, the health crisis resulted in fewer crimes. However, in parts of Italy, the police warned the public to watch out for impostors knocking on doors and claiming to be Red Cross volunteers. In densely populated countries like India and Pakistan, if the coronavirus spell drags out, it may bring a surge in crimes.

Because the police has a presence in all areas, it is in a better position to immediately act as first responders. And since police stations are the basic functional apparatus of the state, citizens expect a lot more from them. The rural police stations may also be of great help in these times, but greater coordination between the health department and the police needs to be institutionalised.

Websites, email, helplines and SMS are effective tools to reach the public. All provincial police departments maintain websites, but like the centralised policing model, our websites are also over-centralised. Though a handful of police departments are running pages on social media, effective linkage requires interactive public-friendly police websites. During the ongoing crisis, for the first time, the Punjab Police started optimum use of its official website that will simultaneously improve public and media relations.

While law enforcement and public health is an emerging field, in developing countries, public health and policing are averse to collaboration. Participation of the police in such crisis could improve their image and highlight their humane face.

In Pakistan, there is hardly any effort by police organisations to document relief operations and review flaws in their working. During times of crisis, the police performs multiple functions, like rescue operations, protection of life and property, crowd management, security during relief distribution, security of rescue camps, managing traffic, and coordinating with other agencies. Since the police have regular interaction with the public, they are in the best position to infuse volunteerism among residents.

Numerical strength alone cannot yield dividends. There is a need for more comprehensive legislation, capacity building, training and equipment. The police must be financed and empowered in a manner that, before seeking help of civil armed forces, they should have the capacity to sustain the burden during the initial phase of a major crisis.

1293,306,471,https://www.dawn.com/news/1579389,9/13/20 6:51,The ‘honour’ in murder,"ACCORDING to Human Rights Watch, almost 1,000 women are murdered in Pakistan in the name of honour each year — killed on the grounds of ‘unacceptable’ amorous relationships, defiance of physical or cyber-gendered spaces, brazenness in dressing and language or perceived immorality.

Qandeel Baloch was one such woman who was shunned and eventually killed for challenging entrenched patriarchal norms. Her struggle warrants particular mention because she inspired and propelled (though posthumously) critical reform in the law that deals with ‘honour’ killing in Pakistan. This year marks her fourth death anniversary.

Qandeel reclaimed — or at least attempted to reclaim — online spaces in a society that strictly limits women’s access to public spaces. Through her bold and vocal videos and statements, Qandeel asserted her independence to live according to her own choices, and refused to conform. And for that, she was seen as a slight to her family’s so-called honour, as someone who deserved to be brutally killed. In the aftermath of her death, Qandeel has been reimagined as a symbol of defiance, independence and women’s empowerment, but her death is also a reminder of the fate of bold and vocal women in Pakistan who challenge the status quo, and societal notions of what is acceptable, decent, and proper.

Many others have since met a similar fate. Earlier this year, two teenage girls were brutally murdered by a family member in a Waziristan village, after a video of them surfaced on social media. In July, 24-year-old Waziran was stoned to death in Jamshoro by her husband and brother, allegedly on the pretext of honour. Last month, police named a man who had shot dead his 19-year-old sister in Karachi because of her “constant interactions” with a “man in the neighbourhood”.

Qandeel asserted her independence. For that, she was seen as someone who deserved to be killed.

In our law, taking a person’s life — mostly women — in the name of honour has been treated differently from conventional murder.

The courts’ decisions have often viewed the accused — mostly men — in such cases with particular empathy, treating the ‘affront’ to his honour in, let’s say, finding his sister with her ‘lover’ as a mitigating circumstance that entitles him to a lesser punishment. Confronted with such a situation, it has been reasoned in the past that a man may have been so gravely and suddenly provoked that he lost his power of self-control, causing the death of the person responsible for the so-called ‘provocation’. Taking a person’s life in such state of loss of self-control would not amount to ‘murder’ but to ‘culpable homicide’ punishable at the judges’ discretion to imprisonment for a term varying from 10 years to life imprisonment.

Despite judgements to the contrary, such rationale — which is based on a legal exception that was removed from our law some decades ago — has on occasion been upheld by Pakistan’s superior courts in cases of honour killing. This, coupled with the erstwhile capacity of a victim’s wali, or legal heir, to either compound the offence and/or waive the right of qisas (retributive penalty) by forgiving the person guilty of killing for honour (often a relative) has unfortunately permitted (relative) impunity to such murderers under our law.

The legislature has made relevant amendments to the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure twice in the recent past — first in 2004, and again in 2016, following the brutal murder of Qandeel Baloch — to provide that qatl-i-amd, or murder committed on the pretext of honour, shall be subject to a minimum penalty of life imprisonment regardless of the compounding of the offence and/or waiver of qisas by the victim’s family. The amended law has thereby rescinded the courts’ erstwhile discretion and the requirement of a family’s preference and/or consent in sentencing in such cases.

There was hope that such amendments had closed the “loopholes and lacunae in the existing laws”. However, judicial verdicts continued to hand out concessions to murderers who had killed women, and in some cases men, in the name of honour. In 2018, the Supreme Court, by relying on the principle of grave and sudden provocation, reduced the life sentence of an accused who had admitted to murdering his sister-in-law in the name of ghairat or honour, to that of rigorous imprisonment of 20 years.

It is in this context that the importance of the Supreme Court’s recent decision in ‘Muhammad Abbas v The State’ must be appreciated. First, the order unequivocally held that following the 2004 and 2016 amendments, murder committed in the name of honour is subject to the minimum penalty of life imprisonment, even where there may be an element of grave and sudden provocation. Second, in passing the order, the court effectively overruled the treatment of grave and sudden provocation, through an affront to a person’s honour, as a mitigating factor in the treatment of and sentencing in honour killing cases.

Lastly, the apex court emphasised that “the Holy Quran … does not permit killing on the ground of adultery, let alone on the ground of ghairat [honour] … nor prescribes a lesser punishment for such killings”. All lives are sacred in Islam, the court reasoned, and a murder committed in the name of honour does not entail lesser culpability.

With the door hopefully shut to the application of the principle of grave and sudden provocation in honour killings, and the Supreme Court’s clear emphasis on the minimum penalty of life imprisonment for killing over honour, the loopholes in the law may have finally closed.

Yet, this judgement and its interpretation of the 2004 and 2016 amendments may not impact the incidence of honour killing in our society much; the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan reported “little evidence that the incidence of honour crimes has abated” despite the aforementioned legal amendments.

How can a province with a population of 120 million be governed when its chief executive cannot get along with police chiefs and has removed five of them within a span of two years?

It is evident that he does not possess the ability or the acumen to lead the province. The law and order situation is in tatters and the morale of the police force has touched a new low. Criminal elements in our society take advantage of such an inept government.

This state of affairs prevails because Prime Minister Imran Khan insists on retaining the incumbent chief minister.

This takes me back many decades when the prime minister was captain of our cricket team.

He retained Mansoor Akhtar, a cricketer who never delivered when required. Mansoor was part of two World Cups, 1983 and 1987. He played eight innings and scored just 108 runs at an average of 13.5 runs per innings. The prime minister’s stubbornness in retaining a non-performing chief minister will cost the PTI heavily come the elections.

The gang-rape incident near Lahore toll plaza on Sialkot-Lahore motorway needs immediate attention of the authorities in many ways. Since its inauguration in March, this section of the motorway has been in the news for one reason or the other.

On this 91km motorway, there is no deployment of motorway police, no rest area, no petrol pump, no washroom, no drinking water facilities, and so on and so forth.

There are many illegal u-turns on this motorway which pose a serious risk to travellers’ lives. At places, the damaged fence allows the local bikers to make their way to travel on the motorway. Apart from the recent rape tragedy, this pathetic condition can cause accidents in the future as well.

This is the time to review and implement motorway management standard operating procedures to give commuters a safer and better travelling experience.

WHILE the shock that we received from the news of the rape and murder of a five-year-old girl had barely subsided that the incident of a young woman gang-raped on the motorway between Lahore to Gujranwala in front of her children has shocked us.

Has our society lost all morality and ethics?

To make matters worse, this portion of the highway has no security because it has not been assigned to the motorway police. Just think of the trauma inflicted on the victim and her children.

I am a pediatrician. When I examine the private parts of young children less than 10 years old, there is so much resistance on the part of child that I have to counsel and reassure them. All this is done while the parent is sitting close.

One can imagine the anguish and suffering the minor child who was raped as well as the young mother. The monsters who commit such heinous acts need to be dealt with severely.

The scholars were attending a dialogue, jointly organised by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) office of UN Women and the EVAW Alliance KP, to observe the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence (GBV). The scholars also signed a declaration condemning gender-based violence and vowed to spread awareness in their respective communities to put an end to the practice.

They also acknowledged that while any individual can be a victim of GBV, in Pakistan, women, ""being the most vulnerable segment of society and deprived of their basic rights"", were more likely to face such violence, followed by members of the transgender community. The scholars emphasised that it was the state's responsibility to protect the vulnerable sections of society.

""There is a need to strengthen state-run social protection networks and ensure the provision of required support to vulnerable groups,” the press release quoted the scholars as saying.

“For prevention of gender-based violence, the state has primary responsibility to protect its citizens and religious leaders have a strong potential to influence the lives and behaviour of those who follow their faith and share their beliefs,” they further said.

Explaining the role of religious leaders in efforts against GBV, EVAW/G Alliance co-Chair Qamar Naseem said that scholars had great influence over people and can help in ""shaping the behaviour of local communities"".

“It is essential to engage religious scholars from different faith groups, as a practical strategy, to raise awareness on gender-based violence and address the issue,” Naseem was quoted as saying.

Provincial head of United Nations Women KP, Zainab Qaisar Khan, said that gender-based violence was not limited to domestic abuse, sexual violence including rape and honour crimes and added: “It can happen anywhere, anytime and across all classes irrespective of education level and income status. It can happen against boys, men, elderly and transgender but mostly the target are women and girls.”",[],"Religious scholars from different schools of faith stressed that it was ""crucial"" to end violence of all kinds against women in order to build a peaceful society and maintain interfaith harmony, a press statement by EVAW Alliance KP and UN Women said on Tuesday.

Concerns over rising incidents

The police study also did a comparative analysis of child abuses with other three provinces, which revealed that the most child abuse cases were reported in Punjab followed by Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Referring to various child abuse cases in Punjab, the police study noted with concern that such cases were increasing in Sindh.

It pointed out two cases in Naushahro Feroze district, which had been declared as “utterly unbelievable and extremely reprehensible”.

In one case, a man confessed that he had been raping her two daughters for nearly a year. The police took action against him when the victims approached the police and filed a written complaint against him.

As nobody believed their ordeal, the victims managed to film a video of their father, which later on was submitted to the police for further investigation.

In another such case in the same area, a paternal uncle was alleged to have broken into a house and sexually assaulted his minor niece. Later the mother singlehandedly protested and demanded the justice.

Call to spread awareness among children

Citing several research studies carried out in the country and abroad, the police study said there were adverse consequences of child abuse ranging from social, emotional, cognitive, educational problems, to low self-esteem and self-harm or sometimes it may lead to suicide.

There were also links between physical abuse, depression, and aggressive behaviours.

“It appears that males and females react differently to trauma, with males engaging in more antisocial behaviours and females becoming more withdrawn.”

Other long-term effects included criminal risk taking behaviours and drug and alcohol problems.

Several recommendations have been made to control child abuse cases such as blocking porn websites, stamping out drug mafias and creating awareness among young children about child abuse at schools.

It also called for adopting child protection policies.

Several recommendations have been made to control child abuse cases such as blocking porn websites, stamping out drug mafias and creating awareness among young children about child abuse at schools.","['victims', 'child', 'arrested', 'children', 'cases', 'abuse', 'courts', '358', 'sindh', 'pending', 'presented', 'suspects', 'reported']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/04/5ca4615fe2ab2.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189f00b83e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0d52ba8a43.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/03/5e6ef7b377bd8.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d005917e0.jpg?0.8785461548197806', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/04/5ca4615fe2ab2.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21824a8678.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189916390d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/03/5e6ef7b377bd8.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/11/5dce12e63253b.jpg?r=30712423', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0ec56aad75.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/11/5dce12e63253b.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd22283a73d3.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fc7833a64a3a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18a3ece187.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f94d8916a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f4142e469.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24c3aad888.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24e90196c5.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/03/5e6ef7b377bd8.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Around 96 boys and 20 girls have fallen prey to abusers in Karachi alone.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1541169', 'type': 'article', 'title': '358 child abuse cases reported in last five years across Sindh', 'description': 'Around 96 boys and 20 girls have fallen prey to abusers in Karachi alone.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/03/5e6ef7b377bd8.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1541169', 'title': '358 child abuse cases reported in last five years across Sindh', 'description': 'Around 96 boys and 20 girls have fallen prey to abusers in Karachi alone.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/03/5e6ef7b377bd8.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-03-16 07:00:38', 'modified_time': '2020-03-16 08:52:15', 'tag': 'Violence against children', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/1200/imtiaz-ali'}, 'keywords': 'Violence against children', 'news_keywords': 'Violence against children', 'author': 'Imtiaz Ali'})",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dawn,,2020-03-16
1362,375,574,https://www.dawn.com/news/1588201,11/2/20 13:17,"Underage marriage: 13-year-old Arzoo recovered after SHC orders, says Wahab","Arzoo, a teenage Christian girl who was allegedly abducted before being forcefully converted and married to a Muslim man, has been recovered, Sindh government spokesperson Murtaza Wahab announced through a tweet on Monday evening.

Speaking to Dawn.com, acting Karachi police chief Additional IG Arif Hanif confirmed that the 13-year-old girl had been recovered safely and her purported husband had also been arrested.

The city police chief said the girl would be sent to a shelter home as per the directions of the Sindh High Court (SHC) while the suspect would be presented before the court on Tuesday.

Earlier in the day, the SHC had ordered the police to recover Arzoo and shift her to a shelter home.

""The judge has ordered the girl be recovered by police and relevant agencies and shifted to a shelter home. Next hearing fixed for Thursday morning [November 5]. My lawyer has informed the court that an intervener will be filed on my behalf,"" Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari said in a tweet.

Activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir — who is part of the legal team fighting the case on behalf of Arzoo's parents — also confirmed the development, adding that the SHC had directed that the girl be produced before the court at the next hearing. Speaking to Dawn.com, he said the court in the meantime has ordered that a medical test be conducted to determine the girl's age.

The court noted that issues to be addressed are the girl's age, whether she was forcibly converted and if her marriage is legal, he said.

""I trust the Sindh government and the police would use all resources at their disposal"" to recover Arzoo, he said.

""To save our children, the government, judiciary, lawyers, civil society and the media should all be on the same page. We all need to play our respective roles effectively,"" he said.

""Glad both the Sindh government and the federal government want to pursue #JusticeForArzoo. There is a lot to learn from the injustices committed in this case first by the accused and then by our governance system. With both governments on board hope this case will become ground for renewed focus on child rights,"" he added.

Sindh government spokesperson Wahab added that the court had issued the directives on an application filed by the provincial government.

Sindh Governor Imran Ismail said Arzoo's case would be solved according to the law. ""There can be no compromise on cases involving underage marriage,"" he said while meeting representatives of minority communities at the Governor House.

The alleged abduction of 13-year-old Arzoo last month had sparked protests from human rights groups against her purported forced conversion and underage marriage with a Muslim man.

According to the first information report of the case registered on his complaint, Arzoo's father Raja stated that on October 13, he and his wife went to work while their son Shahbaz had gone to school. The complainant said his three daughters, including Arzoo, were present at their home in Railway Colony when he received a call from a relative, who told him that Arzoo was missing from the house.

Raja said he reached home and contacted their neighbours, but could not trace his daughter. He subsequently lodged a case regarding the abduction of his daughter against unknown persons at the Frere police station.

Arzoo's family members earlier this month told Dawn that her purported husband Azhar lived in a house opposite theirs along with his family and he was at least 45-years-old. ""The rascal who abducted her has prepared fake papers to show that she is 18-years-old,” her mother said.

Police had booked Syed Ali Azhar, the girl's alleged husband, and arrested his brothers, Syed Shariq Ali, Syed Mohsin Ali, and a friend, Danish, for allegedly abducting the underage girl, purportedly forcibly converting her and marrying her to a Muslim man.

On Saturday, a judicial magistrate had dismissed an application filed by Arzoo's family pleading to send her to a shelter home. Arzoo's father had filed an application under Rule 5 of the Child Marriages Restraint Rules read with Rules 8, 9 and 10 of the Child Marriages Restrain Act, 2013 and Section 100 of the criminal procedure code.

Nasir had argued that girl was 13, therefore, the provisions of the Sindh Child Marriages Restrain Act had also been incorporated in the matter by the investigating agency.

He had argued that the relevant documents concerning the victim's age had already been provided by the complainant to the investigating officer and the same were showing her age as 13 years.

Nasir had contended that further stay of the victim with suspect Azhar would amount to an offence punishable under Section 376 (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 375(v) (rape: with or without her consent when she is under sixteen years of age).

He had said that the complainant was not even asking for the custody of the victim, as he had no objection sending her to a shelter home for DNA testing and other requirements for the investigation.

The investigating officer in the case, Inspector Shariq Ahmed Siddiqui, had stated that the victim had appeared before the SHC and was sent under the protection of the SHO of the Preedy police station in compliance with the court's Oct 27 order.

He said he had called in verification of the victim's B-form, which as per the National Database and Registration Authority, was genuine.","['Dawn.Com', 'Imtiaz Ali', 'Vivek Lahore', 'Peer Baba Khwajaji', 'Iftikhar Husain', 'Surya Kant', 'Nitin Saini', 'M.

1365,378,578,https://www.dawn.com/news/1571736,7/29/20 7:05,Saving the children,"PROMISED a good life, to be ‘treated as family’, and given wholesome meals, decent wages and access to education, the reality for many millions of domestic child workers in Pakistan is just the opposite.

Domestic servitude puts children’s well-being at risk. They are made to work from sunrise to sunset, fed leftovers, allowed little rest and are locked up and brutally beaten.

Earlier in May, eight-year-old Zohra Shah’s employers allegedly beat her up so badly that she died of her injuries for releasing the household’s prized parrots from a cage. In 2019, a 16-year-old domestic worker Uzma Bibi was brutally tortured and murdered for helping herself to a small piece of meat. In 2018, 10-year old Tayyaba’s bruised face was all over social media.

While not all child domestic workers are treated as severely, the ILO considers domestic work hazardous. It exposes children to violence, abuse, sexual abuse and long hours of work while denying them access to healthcare and education.

Domestic labour puts the child’s well-being at risk.

It is illegal to employ children under 18 in factories and other service industries, but except for Punjab there is no law banning them from working inside homes. And thus this shroud of invisibility provides the perfect impunity to employers to perpetrate violence till the time a case like Zohra Shah’s surfaces.

Then the entire country goes into some kind of collective retribution. Social media highlights abuse by employers, hashtags call for justice for the victim or survivor; the police get into action and arrest the alleged perpetrators; mainstream electronic media flash ‘breaking news’; newspapers publish editorials; and Pakistani legislators, celebrities and influencers send messages with sentiments ranging from shock and anger to anguish. Often this outrage subsides as quickly as it erupts. Zohra Shah was forgotten even before she was quietly buried in her village of Muzaffargarh. Few seem interested in following up on the pressure the parents of such children often face from employers to quash the case or keep quiet in exchange for ‘hush’ money.

However, things seem to be looking up this time around. While the adults have been dilly-dallying for years over this issue, this time the youth of Pakistan have taken it upon themselves to end the scourge.

The campaign to end child domestic labour, initiated by Idare-e-Taleem-o-Aagahi (ITA) last month may have found traction with 20 rights-based Pakistani organisations, but it is the youth who seem to be this campaign’s backbone. Aged between 10 to 18 and belonging to all strata and school systems from across the country, they have stepped in to end what is so normalised in Pakistani society and which one young student terms as nothing but ‘child abuse’.

But along with bringing about a mindset change, it is time to look at how the country’s law is protecting its children.

For instance, there is some confusion in the statute book that needs to be cleared. Section 328-A of the Pakistan Penal Code gives the child ample protection, Section 89 of the same PPC allows parents, guardians and teachers to use corporal punishment in “good faith”.

While good laws need stricter implementation, certain existing ones need amendments. According to Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari, the 1991 Employment of Children Act needs to be amended to include child domestic labour among the list of proscribed jobs considered hazardous and banned for children under 14.

The ITA wants to make it even more watertight by proposing a constitutional amendment in Article 11(3) prohibiting all children under 16 from engaging in any form of labour, in any capacity. Those between the ages of 16 and 18 may work, but only in non-hazardous occupati­ons, with well-defined codes of working conditions, and hours and wages stipulated in a written contract.

But even before all the tweaking of law is carried out, the contradictions within the country’s Constitution and the Penal Code about the legal age of a child needs to be addressed. Article 25A of the Constitution that makes the state responsible to provide free and compulsory education terms a child to be anywhere between the ages of five to 16 years; Article 11 disallows slavery, forced labour, human trafficking and hazardous employment for children under the age of 14.

Presently, the only province that prohibits child domestic labour is Punjab with its Punjab Domestic Workers Act, 2019. But cam­­­paigners say it is weak in addressing child domestic labour as it only prohibits children under 15 from being employed and the violators get away as neither punishment nor fine are tough enough. Further, the violators cannot be arrested by police. It is time other pro­vinces followed suit while the legal loopholes that exist in the Punjab law must be closed.

While laws will be crafted, in the end it is society itself that can end this practice by disabusing itself of the notion that it is doing poor families a good turn by hiring their children.

It is time other pro­vinces followed suit while the legal loopholes that exist in the Punjab law must be closed.","['saving', 'child', 'labour', 'children', 'domestic', 'end', 'good', 'punjab', 'employers', 'work', 'law']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2959763eb2.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f0c543fe8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/07/5f20d5f44c223.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fbd36879d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e0fc3a04b.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/07/5f20d5f44c223.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/07/5f20d5f44c223.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Domestic labour puts the child’s well-being at risk.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1571736', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Saving the children', 'description': 'Domestic labour puts the child’s well-being at risk.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/07/5f20d5f44c223.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1571736', 'title': 'Saving the children', 'description': 'Domestic labour puts the child’s well-being at risk.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/07/5f20d5f44c223.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-07-29 07:05:06', 'modified_time': '2020-07-29 07:05:06', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/1702/zofeen-t-ebrahim'}, 'author': 'Zofeen T.

The prosecutor’s office said the men were believed to have behaved in a “particularly degrading and cruel” manner to the 12 migrants, including two minors, from India, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

They were allegedly detained for two weeks in October in a house in the country’s north. The four suspects were arrested last year but the arrests were announced on Monday.

According to the prosecution, the suspects “caused [the migrants] to lose their sense of time, gave them food only once a day and physically abused them”. They also allegedly demanded money from their prisoners’ relatives in other European countries and threatened to kill the migrants when they asked to be freed.

One migrant managed to contact relatives who reported the case to Serbian authorities, who in turn informed police in North Macedonia, the prosecutor’s office said.

The three Pakistanis were arrested and are in custody pending trial. If convicted, they face up to eight years in prison. The Macedonian national, who owns the house where the migrants were allegedly being held, has also been charged and is under house arrest.

North Macedonia is a key stage on the route many migrants take through the Balkans towards prosperous European countries after illegally entering neighbouring Greece — mostly on small smuggling boats from Turkey.

On the Greek island of Lesbos, where most of the boats arrive, migrants clashed with police on Monday during a protest over severe overcrowding at the local Moria camp and delays in Greece’s asylum procedure.

Riot police used tear gas to disperse several hundred protesters who had planned to march from the camp to the island capital of Mytilene, about 5 kilometres (3.1 miles) away. No arrests or injuries were reported.

Also on Monday, police in Cyprus said they safely escorted to the coastal town of Larnaca a boat with 87 Syrian migrants that had left from the Turkish port of Mersin and was spotted by radar off the island nation’s southeastern tip.

The 61 men, 10 women and 16 children were taken to a reception centre outside the capital Nicosia.","['A.

1423,436,677,https://images.dawn.com/news/1184941,4/2/20 21:00,"Even during a pandemic, female doctors are facing harassment","Doctors across Pakistan and all over the world are on the frontlines during the coronavirus pandemic.

While a lot of them are working tirelessly in hospitals - isolating themselves from their families and risking their own lives - testing and treating patients, many have also volunteered their services to raise awareness and made themselves available to answer any concerns of civilians.

All around social media, folks are sharing their appreciation for medical workers, calling them heroes and warriors. Surely they're getting the respect they deserve, right?

Well, the male doctors are... Can't say the same for women.

Apparently, even a pandemic can't stop predators from harassing women in the medical field who are utilising their time to help those in need. And those doctors have had enough.

Yep, you got that right. Where doctors are talking about saving yourself from a dangerous virus, some men are trolling them with vulgar messages.

Imagine being a doctor and trying your best to help people, being made to waste precious time having to block/report numbers using such abusive language.

For female doctors, this is not a new case though, as Dr. Anza shared with Images.

""It starts right from when you join med school. If you mention it on your social media profile or even hint at it, the messages start pouring.""

""What's weird is how they always start off in an eerily 'respectful' manner, saying 'Hello doctor sahiba' and then it goes off in a bad direction. Sometimes it's from other doctors - or people claiming to be doctors/med students.""

Dr. Fizza* started facing problems after becoming a volunteer.

""I've been relatively under the radar so I hadn't really faced anything like what I had heard from fellow doctors,"" said Fizza.

""When the time came to volunteer, I joined in immediately, genuinely hoping to help as much as I can. But then came the attacks.""

""Sometimes they would start off like a real patient but things would take a shift. And I'd ignore it a lot because I'd think, 'They’re just trolls', but sometimes the messages would be too graphic and come with pictures and videos that would just ruin my day. I knew of such things happening but seeing it for myself was depressing.""

Fizza revealed that she also backed out of volunteering because it was too much to bear.

Aleeza*, the founder of an online telemedicine company, opened up more about the virtual harassment faced by her team. Her company has a team of female doctors who are digitally connected to patients that need healthcare.

""We have an app through which patients can directly connect with female doctors and have a consultation via chat, audio or video call,"" said Aleeza, adding that they face this issue a lot on the app, especially the past few months.

""Last Saturday, we made our app free for the coming three months so that people could use it during this pandemic, to ask about Covid-19 symptoms, screenings etc especially because of the lockdown and the load in hospitals, a person shouldn't have to go in just for a consultation.""

""We made the app free to help people and every now and then, someone calls to say 'I love you' to a doctor who could be helping a person who needs it, saying 'Please talk to me', 'What are you doing', 'Tell me about yourself'. As soon as someone starts doing so, we block them. We've had enough to know how to deal with them now.""

For this app and its doctors, the preparation came from a previous spammer attack. Aleeza revealed that they had been facing issues long before they made their app free. That's right, people paid to troll female doctors who just wanted to do their job.

""Around two months ago, we had a spammer attack where a number of men started calling all our doctors, booking their slots, which the doctor couldn't unbook for another patient and bombarding them with missed calls. The doctors couldn't see any other patients.""

""Then those guys started having inappropriate conversations, sending vulgar pictures and porn site links within the session... Again, this was when the app wasn't even free. They were paying to do all this! I guess we did make good money from it.""

Of course Aleeza and her team took immediate action to figuring it out and reducing the trolling.

""We reported it and added some checks and balance on our app after which it reduced significantly but they're still there.""

Despite all the regulations, some problematic folks still get through, and while it may be a joke for some, the damage is quite deep for the people at this telemedicine company.

""I work with doctors who come back to work,"" explained Aleeza. ""The main purpose of my company is to bring female doctors who've left the field back into the workforce. So many aspiring doctors end up quitting after marriage. It takes a lot for them to convince their family for why they need to come back to work even though this is a manageable way to do so.""

""Some of my doctors actually said they can't do this because when they come back to work and they get this treatment, their family becomes very upset. During the spam attack, a lot of them got disturbed and demotivated.""

She added, ""We do our best to help our doctors but it's sad that we have to mentally prepare them for this. There should be more talk about this because a lot of hospitals are using telemedicine now. A lot of doctors especially female doctors will face this abuse.""

According to Dr Tooba*, another who volunteered to help during the pandemic, calling out their behaviour doesn't work.

""They want a response out of you. Whether it's angry or complicit. They know no matter what they do and no matter how you response, you will bear the brunt of it all. That' the victim-blaming culture.""

Tooba shared that her family got very concerned from the first time it happened.

However, she isn't backing down.

""I'm a vocal person, so the first time a guy started saying gross things, I was angry and was yelling at him. Thankfully, my family is understanding about such situations but they worry about me. I don't blame them, just like I don't blame the women who aren't volunteering anymore. It takes a toll on you.""

Of course there are many like Tooba who are standing strong, getting work done despite all these hurdles. They're calling out the problematic behaviour and moving past it. But should they have to? Not at all.

We've normalised harassment so much that we expect this to happen and as a society, it's a nuisance to hear about such accounts. Too many times we've seen women post about what they face in their daily lives and some respond with ""That's life"" or ""No need to make a hue."" Guess what? When they aren't vocal, you deny it happening or restrict it to singular analogies.

It's about time we address such problems and for the love of humanity - the very humanity these doctors are trying to save - stop harassing women who are just trying to do their job.

1435,448,694,https://www.dawn.com/news/1563594,6/15/20 6:59,KP police reforms,"BEFORE the passage of the 25th Constitutional Amendment, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) had different administrative, law-enforcement and legal fabrics. After the amendment and the military operations, KP is experiencing another administrative and legal transition.

The successful implementation of a few reform measures led the provincial government to enact the KP Police Ordinance, 2016, which was followed by the enactment of the KP Police Act, 2017. The law was passed with the aim of making the police service apolitical, operationally autonomous and accountable to civilian oversight. It is a pioneer police law in that it entrusts the IG with complete operational autonomy.

Ideally, law-enforcement agencies are assessed on the basis of operational autonomy, public safety, service delivery and accountability. Though the 2017 act provides a framework for all such essentials, their implementation remains selective. Hence, public safety is compromised. Police Order 2002, and Section 13 (3-VI) of Police Act 2017 also provide the ‘internal accountability apparatus’ but under Police Order 2002 this either remained dysfunctional or accountability remained selective.

Section 17(6) of the KP Police Act, 2017, obligates the provincial police officer to draft an annual policing plan but this has yet to happen. Similarly, Section 22(2) of the act obligates the district police officer (DPO) to also draft an annual police plan, to be consistent with the overall provincial plan. But both are nowhere in sight, mainly due to the absence of the provincial public safety commission.

The challenges of policing in KP are unique.

Chapter 5 of the 2017 act provides for the composition and functions of the public safety commissions but inherent flaws in the composition of scrutiny committees stalled the process. To select independent members of the provincial public safety commission, the scrutiny committee has to include the chief justice of the Peshawar High Court and chairmen of the defunct Ehtesab Commission and the Public Service Commission.

However, in 2018 the inclusion of the Peshawar High Court chief justice and district judges was challenged in the Peshawar High Court on the plea that it was in violation of the principle of the separation of the executive and judiciary incorporated in Article 175(3) of the Constitution. Moreover, with the KP Ehtesab Commission later dissolved in December 2018, the position of one member of the scrutiny committee stands nullified while that of another remains sub judice.

Furthermore, improving the quality of investigations neither remained a professional priority nor was it allocated the required resources. Section 26(8) of the 2017 law makes SP Investigation answerable to the DPO. However, such subordination gives birth to duality of command that often compromises the rights and interests of the complainants.

For the first time in Pakistan, a police law provided a framework for overseeing the implementation process. Section 143 of the KP Police Act, 2017, calls for the appointment of an ‘implementation commissioner’. However, the previous implementation commissioner has completed his one-year term, and a new appointment is yet to be made.

Moreover, Section 47 allows for public-police coordination through the formation of public liaison councils. Under the law, 70 per cent of the council members are to be notified from village councils and 30pc from amongst notables. Although these councils have been entrusted with numerous functions, including assistance to the police in crime prevention, the maintenance of public order, sharing of information regarding new tenants, misuse of loudspeakers and reporting of hate speech, capacity constraints have limited their output. The discretion of the DPOs regarding the selection of councils also warrants independent monitoring.

The challenges of policing in KP are unique and the merger of the tribal areas has multiplied them. Besides crime prevention and detection, the police also have to deal with counterterrorism, counter-extremism, issues related to the merger of levies and Khasadar men with the provincial police umbrella, increased public service and the execution of a doable transition plan in Malakand and erstwhile Fata. These are a few major priorities for the ongoing transition to sustain the hard-earned peace in the province.

The present challenges can effectively be dealt with by employing honest officers, adopting long-term planning and additional resource allocation. Cosmetic and mere change of faces may not yield the dividends. Administering the tribal districts via remote-controlled policing will only end up creating a greater administrative void. The only option left is to convert the challenge into an opportunity that is best suited to the state.

They said the arrests were made after a man lodged a complaint with the police in which he said his 13-year-old son had been abused by the suspects. A case was registered under Pakistan Penal Code section 377-B.

Police said the suspects also filmed the victim and blackmailed him. The child was abused for more than a month, during which time he stole Rs200,000 from his home to give to the suspects.

The investigating officer in the case, Assistant Sub-Inspector Zahid Hameed told Dawn that three suspects were arrested and produced in the court of the magistrate for a physical remand. They were remanded into police custody for four days.

He said all three suspects were working at a store in the jurisdiction of the Kohsar police, and their accomplice worked at a house and was still at large.

He added that the victim underwent a medical examination, the final report of which was awaited.

Mr Hameed said the parents of the victim learned of the incident after the child’s mother found more than Rs200,000 missing. The child confessed to stealing the money and told her what had happened, he said.

He added that more than Rs100,000 has been recovered, while the remaining sum is in the possession of the fourth suspect, who has disappeared from the house where he is employed.

However, Mr Hameed said, his employer has assured that he would be produced before the investigators and that the remaining money would be recovered from him.

1438,451,697,https://www.dawn.com/news/1584162,10/10/20 7:05,Six underage boys get bail in Karachi University harassment case,"KARACHI: A judicial magistrate on Friday granted bail to six teenage suspects held for allegedly harassing female students in Karachi University.

Police claimed to have arrested the suspects, all said to be the children of KU employees, and booked them for allegedly harassing female students on the campus.

On Friday, the investigating officer produced them before the judicial magistrate (East) to seek their physical remand for interrogation and investigation.

However, the suspects moved an application, through their defence counsel, seeking grant of post-arrest bail.

The defence counsel opposed the IO’s request for police remand stating that they were underage and the case against them was without any merits.

He asked the judge to grant them post-arrest bail.

After hearing arguments from the state prosecutor, the judge granted bail to the suspects against a surety of Rs20,000 each.

The judge turned down the IO’s request for remand of the suspects, who were told to cooperate with the police during the investigation of the case.

On Thursday, the varsity administration had handed over the suspects, said to be residents of KU’s staff town, to the Mobina Town police after some students of the Institute of Business Administration (IBA), which is located on the KU premises, complained on social media of an alleged harassment and intimidation incident on the campus.

The matter surfaced on the night between Wednesday and Thursday, when an IBA student, Syed Shaheer Ali, shared on Facebook that he was harassed in KU while he was returning after dropping one of the female students at the IBA Girls’ Hostel.

He alleged that around 10 young men, aged between 10 to 16 years, surrounded him on four motorcycles and harassed him.

Mr Ali said he dropped the female student at the Girls’ Hostel at around 11.30pm and then he along with a female friend headed towards Maskan, when 10 people on four motorcycles suddenly appeared and surrounded his car, shouting to get out of the vehicle.

The male student said it was pitch dark at KU, with complete silence and “we were stuck around the bushes. I tried my best to hold my nerves and pressed the accelerator to full as I tried to run away”, he wrote on social media.

“As we ran and reached near IBA Boys Hostel, they again appeared and surrounded us forcing me to stop the car. That’s when they came to the car’s window banging and screaming Larki ko Bahar nikaal, Gaari Roukk, Bahar aa... [take the girl out, stop the car, get off].”

However, Ali said he managed to escape and informed the security guards on the Maskan gate of the varsity.

Police claimed to have arrested the suspects, all said to be the children of KU employees, and booked them for allegedly harassing female students on the campus.
The defence counsel opposed the IO’s request for police remand stating that they were underage and the case against them was without any merits.
After hearing arguments from the state prosecutor, the judge granted bail to the suspects against a surety of Rs20,000 each.

1498,511,781,https://www.dawn.com/news/1558404,5/20/20 6:56,JIT formed to probe Waziristan honour killings,"MIRAMSHAH: The Bannu regional police officer has constituted a four-member joint investigation team for probing the honour killing of two teenage girls, whose ‘objectionable’ video went viral lately.

The police have so far arrested four suspects, including the video recorder and the one, released on social media.

North Waziristan district police officer Shafiullah Gandapur will supervise the JIT, whose members include DSP Shahid Adnan, sub-inspectors Mir Sahib Khan and Mohammad Nawaz and assistant sub-inspector Farman Ali.

DPO Gandapur told reporters that the police had arrested Umer Ayaz, who had recorded the video and was seen in it; Fida Mohammad, a friend of Umer Ayaz with whom he had shared the video and suspected him of making it viral; father of one of the girls, Radwal Khan, and a cousin of the girls Roohuddin.

He said the alleged killer, Mohammad Aslam, who was also a cousin of the girls aged 16 and 18 respectively, had gone into hiding and the police were making efforts for his early arrest.

Video recorder among four held, suspected killer at large

The DPO said the police had also contacted cybercrime wing of the Federal Investigation Agency with a request for the deletion of the objectionable video from different websites.

He said the central character, Umer Ayaz, 28, was married and had two children.

Mr Gandapur said as the family had been keeping the issue a secret, it was a challenging case for the police.

“None of the family members had approached the police, so the SHO registered the FIR of the occurrence as the complainant,” he said.

The DPO said provincial police officer Sanaullah Abbasi was taking keen interest in the case. He said the district police were in contact with Karachi police for the tracing of the suspected killer as he used to live there before the killings.

Mr Gandapur said another woman seen in the 52 seconds video was the suspected killer’s wife, who seemed to be spared by the family, as she wasn’t found to be doing anything objectionable.

He said the girls’ family had migrated from South Waziristan area due to the Rah-i-Nijat military operation against militants before settling in Shamplan Garyam village of North Waziristan area.

The DPO added that the family of the deceased girls claimed that the video was filmed around a year ago.

He said Umer Ayaz revealed during investigation that he had only shared the video with friend Fida Mohammad, so he was suspected of making the video viral on social media.

The DPO added that due to sensitivity of the issue, the JIT comprised trained police officers to look into every aspect of the killings.

The girls were killed on May 14, while the Razmak police station registered its FIR on May 15. Initially, the FIR included Section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code but later, Pakistan Penal Code’s Section 311 dealing with fasad fil ard (mischief on earth) and Section 201 (causing of the disappearance of evidence) and Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act’s Section 19 (unauthorised interception of a transmission) were included in it.

1502,515,786,https://www.dawn.com/news/1592212,11/25/20 7:06,GBV and climate,"THE Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was adopted by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in 1979 to pave the way for a world free of gender-based violence. This was followed by the Unite to End Violence against Women initiative launched in 2006 with the aim of raising awareness and increasing policymaking and resources dedicated to achieving the objective.

In 1993, the UNGA adopted the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women through a resolution and on Feb 7, 2000, officially designated Nov 25 as the International Day for Elimination of Violence against Women. In 2017, the EU and UN launched the Spotlight initiative to raise awareness on this issue in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. However, violence against women continues in different forms. To date, 49 countries currently have no laws protecting women from domestic violence.

The variation in the climatic regime has added another layer of complexity to the travails faced by women as climate change is now recognised as a serious aggravator of gender violence. Global warming and its consequent devastation of communities around the world will trigger climate change-induced crises that will worsen domestic violence and increase the risk of violence against women and girls.

Violence against women goes back to a structural functionalist view of gender that diminishes her status and embeds inequality in the social construct as part of the system. According to the conflict theory, the struggle in society is based on dominance among social groups for control over scarce resources. In the context of gender, this can best be explained as an attempt by men to retain their dominant position at the expense of women by keeping them socially subordinate and economically dependent.

Climate change aggravates violence against women.

According to UNDP, nearly 50 per cent of South Asian countries have no laws against domestic violence. Patriarchy is deep-rooted in South Asian culture with women lacking legal and societal protection that expose them to different kinds of violence, and struggling for rights bring them into conflict with family, society and state. In countries where gender parity is poor, the risk factor is likely to be higher. Violence against women is not limited to developing countries only. Reports by CARE and IUCN highlight examples of increase in domestic violence linked to loss in income from the growing impact of climate change on the agricultural sector and sexual abuse of women displaced as a result of natural disasters.

According to a World Bank report, while there has been an overall reduction in poverty, the decline in shared prosperity and uptick in inequality in Pakistan indicates that economic progress is not being shared with the poorest segments. This will contribute to vulnerability of women being accelerated by social and economic losses associated with climate change.

In the Global Gender Gap index, Pakistan ranks third from the bottom. It is also ranked the sixth most dangerous country globally for women with cases of sexual crimes and domestic violence on the rise. According to White Ribbon Pakistan, an NGO working for women’s rights, between 2004 and 2006, 4,734 women faced sexual violence, with over 1,800 cases of domestic violence and kidnapping of 5,500 women.

As per media reports, over 51,241 cases of violence against women were reported between 2011 and 2017. In the Climate Risk Index, the country is among the top 10 countries with disasters likely to increase in frequency and intensity. A large number of women work in the agriculture sector in rural areas where female rate of literacy is low and cultural norms and barriers deprive women of social equity and equal access to resources. These factors leave women unprotected and exposed to violence, making climate action an essential component in the ongoing fight to eliminate violence against women and girls, and mainstreaming gender in policy planning an integral part of climate action.

While the UN continues to be a driving force in supporting gender equality through the Gender Action Plan and the Lima Work Programme on Gender, we need to analyse emerging trends to develop coping strategies for protection of women that highlight linkages between climate stressors and gender violence.

This will require working within sectors not typically addressing gender violence and strengthening capacities to understand the intersection of gender violence and engaging men and women in communities to dismantle harmful gender norms and construct an alternative narrative supporting gender equitable attitudes. For sustainable transformation and integration at all levels leaders must recognise that without freeing women from oppression, violence and discrimination and ensuring their full participation, efforts to achieve development goals will be hampered.

1547,560,858,https://www.dawn.com/news/1568143,7/10/20 12:57,Furore after Indian police shoot gangster dead,"Indian police shot dead one of the country's most wanted gangsters on Friday just a day after his dramatic arrest, sparking accusations of a staged extra-judicial killing.

Officials said Vikas Dubey, detained for the killing of eight police officers, was shot as he tried to escape a police vehicle while being driven to his home city in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.

Within hours of TV stations carrying images of his bloodstained body lying in a hospital, rights lawyers and activists alleged that police had killed Dubey to prevent him revealing his connections with powerful people.

“This is the most blatant case of extra-judicial killing. Dubey was a gangster terrorist who may have deserved to die. But [Uttar Pradesh] police have killed him to shut his mouth,” Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan wrote on Twitter.

“Will we allow police to kill anyone without a court trial?” Utsav Bains, another Supreme Court lawyer, added.

Senior opposition Congress party leader Priyanka Gandhi said the people “protecting” Dubey were still free.

Dubey, aged about 50, was accused in more than 60 murders, attempted murders and other cases. He was said to have shot dead an Uttar Pradesh state minister inside a police station in 2001.

Despite those cases and his reputation for ruthlessness, Dubey has built considerable local political links over the past two decades.

On July 3, eight officers were gunned down when Dubey's gang staged an ambush on a police team aiming to arrest him.

A nationwide manhunt was launched, during which five of Dubey's associates — including his bodyguard nephew — were killed.

The gang leader finally gave himself up in a temple in Madhya Pradesh state on Thursday.

According to the police account, the car taking him to Kanpur early Friday overturned on a wet road and he tried to escape.

“Dubey has been killed in an exchange of fire after he snatched the pistol of our men and tried to flee after firing at them. Four of our men are also injured,” Kanpur police inspector general Mohit Agarwal told reporters.

Nirjhari Sinha, founder of a civil rights organisation in Gujarat state, said his death had revived memories of staged killings there.

“History repeats,” she wrote on Twitter. “Dead gangsters can't speak about their political patronage.”

For decades, shoot-outs were staged to bypass India's judicial system when police battled armed separatist movements in West Bengal, Punjab, Indian-occupied Kashmir and remote northeastern states.

More recently, suspects accused of violent crimes have died in custody.

Last year, police in southern India shot dead four men accused in the horrific rape-murder of a 27-year-old woman.","['American Heart', 'Anoop Shastri', 'Savior Rahul', 'Swiss Neutral', 'K Srinivas Rao', 'Imtiaz Hunzai', 'Berlin', 'Raju S Bhaandari', 'Dr. Dummy', 'Vivek Sharma']","Indian police shot dead one of the country's most wanted gangsters on Friday just a day after his dramatic arrest, sparking accusations of a staged extra-judicial killing.

1594,607,919,https://www.dawn.com/news/1565057,6/25/20 6:51,Videos of police brutality trigger outrage on social media,"PESHAWAR: Disturbing videos of police personnel stripping and torturing an accused inside a police station emerged here on Wednesday and led to a social media uproar over police brutality.

The episode involving Radiullah alias Amiray, a resident of Tehkal, had been doing the round on the social media for past more than a week after the accused apparently under the influence of some intoxicant cursed police officers and later he was taken into custody on charges of possessing drugs along with two other persons.

The accused, who was referring to himself as a province, was turned into butt of memes for several days; however, two videos that emerged on Wednesday wherein policemen could be seen stripping him turned the light banter into a social media outrage.

First video of 19 seconds length, which emerged on Wednesday morning, showed two policemen forcing the semi-naked accused into a room, while two others could be seen following them. Another video of 36 seconds length showed the cops forcing the semi-naked accused to pose for mobile phone video.

Four cops suspended as politicians, lawyers and NGOs seek judicial probe into incident

Social media erupted into an uproar soon after the videos made their way into cyber sphere, while workers of Jamaat-i-Islami and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Civil Society Network took to the streets to protest the inhuman treatment meted to the detainee.

A trend #JusticeforAmir was trending on top in Pakistan with more than 15,000 tweets for several hours till the filing of this report.

Soon after the social media outrage, city police issued a notification announcing to suspend four policemen including Tehkal SHO Shahryar Khan. It said that Shahryar Khan, Zahirullah, Naeem and Tauseef were suspended on account of gross misconduct. It said that the policemen were being charge-sheeted with summary of allegations for departmental action.

Tehkal police later in the day also booked three of them including Zahirullah, Tauseef and Naeem under section 355, 118 and 119 of Pakistan Penal Code for using criminal force to dishonour someone and public servant concealing design commit offence, which is his duty to prevent.

Chief Minister Mahmood Khan also directed the authorities concerned to arrest the policemen, who were dishonouring the citizen. Directorate of Human Rights also ordered an inquiry into the incident and directed an official to look into the matter and present report within three days.

SSP Zahoor Afridi said that police had taken strict notice of the incident and whoever was responsible would be taken to the task. He said that three policemen booked and arrested for dishonouring the citizen while the SHO was suspended for poor supervision.

Amiray was taken into custody by police on June 16 after a video went viral wherein he could be seen cursing police officials. Police charged him along with two other accused identified as Shakil and Mohammad Khan under section 11 of CNSA, section of 15 Arms Act, 4-PO and section 14 of Foreigners Act.

A day later another video emerged where the accused could be seen begging police and saying that he was sorry for his mistake. A policeman, who is not seen in the video, apparently in reference to videos that emerged on Wednesday, mockingly asks him whether he has enjoyed the hospitality in the police station. “How you were honoured at the police station,” he asks the accused twice.

Sources familiar with Amir told Dawn that he was an Afghan refugee living in Tehkal. They said that he used to work at Spring Carnival wedding hall on University Road as waiter and was rendered jobless due to lockdown resulting from Covid-19 outbreak. However, a staffer at the wedding hall said that they had terminated him about eight months ago as his appearance was not suitable for working in family setting.

A man, who has worked along with the accused for several years, said that he was a good guy and had a BA degree. He said that before the emergence of his drunken video, never for once he had seen him doing drugs.

Meanwhile, Pakistan Jurists Association (PJA) in an emergency meeting held with a senior lawyer Saifullah Muhib Kakakhel in the chair said that policemen misused their powers by lodging a fake FIR in reaction and arresting Amiray.

“In police custody, he was undressed, humiliated and sexually harassed by the whole police station of Tehkal. He received injuries in police custody and was also victim of sexual abuse. The acts of police were inhumane, unlawful and against the dignity and privacy of human being,” PJA alleged in a statement.

The members of PJA said that no doubt the man uploaded a video in which he abused the police officers but the treatment and reaction of police was unjustified and not permissible under the law.

PJA demand of Chief Justice of Pakistan, chief justice of Peshawar High Court, IGP, chief minister and other high-ups to take stern action against the policemen involved in the incident.

In their separate statements, ANP provincial president Aimal Wali Khan, QWP provincial chairman Sikandar Hayat Khan Sherpao, Peshawar District Bar Association president Advocate Akhtar Biland, JUI-F provincial deputy general secretary Maulana Ahmad Ali Darvesh also condemned the policemen and demanded judicial probe into incident.

Our correspondent from Charsadda adds: Demonstrations were held in the district to protest police violence against a man in Peshawar. The rallies were led by JI youth and NGOs.

The protesters demanded of chief justice of Peshawar High Court and Chief Justice of Pakistan to take suo moto notice of the incident.

MUZAFFARABAD: Indian troops opened fire across the de facto border in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, killing a soldier and a 15-year-old boy and wounding four others, Pakistan’s military and other officials said on Tuesday.

“In intense exchange of fire Sepoy Shafique fighting valiantly embraced shahadat,” said an Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) press release.

The military said Pakistani troops responded by targeting the Indian positions where the fire originated, causing substantial damage to the posts on the other side.

District administrator Qaiser Orangzeb said the boy was killed on Monday night when Indian mortar shells hit his home along the Line of Control in Kashmir.

On Tuesday, thousands of mourners attended the boy’s funeral, he said. Pakistan says India has violated a 2003 ceasefire agreement 2,000 times this year alone.

1627,640,964,https://www.dawn.com/news/1566670,7/3/20 7:05,Harassment case: Two more staffers suspended after students put forth demands,"LAHORE: At least two more members of the staff from the Lahore Grammar School were suspended after a charter of demands drafted by students and alumni of the LGS 1A1 was presented to the director of the school.

Those who were suspended included the names of main accused Ms Maira Omair Rana and Ms Rubina Shakil for turning a blind eye to the harassment cases brought before them. In the aftermath of the story published in Dawn on June 30, 2020, more allegations by students have surfaced on social media of sexual harassment on campus.

The charter was prepared in response to these claims of sexual harassment which surfaced earlier this week. The students and alumni representatives pushed for a complete reform in the school with regard to sexual harassment which was accepted by the director.

“Ms Nighat Ali said that many of the demands were already being imposed in the school while the rest were also something that they agreed upon and would soon implement them in coming days,” said a representative. “Overall change will take some time but the school was more than happy to listen to us.”

Earlier, the teachers involved in harassment were terminated. An inquiry committee will be overseen by Ms Ali, and will comprise senior members of LGS as well as alumni representatives.

There was the demand of making the procedure of complaints and counseling accessible for harassment victims. A form to be filled in details of a complaint was advised by the students so that they could fill it in themselves without the involvement of parents, and to hide their privacy.

“We also asked them to put up an anti-harassment policy in a public place including the website,” said the alumni representative. “There must also be trainings for all teachers and faculties, and handbooks.”

Meanwhile, the Women’s Action Forum Lahore finally broke its silence and expressed its ‘disturbance’ over the news of harassment allegations. The WAF appreciated the students who had the courage and confidence to complain about sexual harassment and bringing a very serious though neglected issue to public notice. They highlighted that sexual harassment was found in all private and public institutions, as well as in single sex and coeducational institutions and madrassahs where both girls and boys are vulnerable.

The WAF highlighted that the Punjab Sexual Harassment at Workplace Act, 2014 does not apply to students and that an effective system and mechanism within it needs to be put in place to ensure that students’ complaints are immediately heard and addressed. It also said that parents must also recognize the importance of initiatives such as school workshops on CSA, puberty and adolescence that are taken to ensure the safety of the child.

“It is not the matter of just one school, neither should it be sensationalized,” said one member of WAF. “This is a social evil present in every sector and every institution, be it a madrassah or a private school.”

The charter was prepared in response to these claims of sexual harassment which surfaced earlier this week.
The students and alumni representatives pushed for a complete reform in the school with regard to sexual harassment which was accepted by the director.
The WAF appreciated the students who had the courage and confidence to complain about sexual harassment and bringing a very serious though neglected issue to public notice.

1631,644,969,https://www.dawn.com/news/1583103,10/4/20 8:12,Child abuser awarded 14 years jail term,"PESHAWAR: A child protection court in Mardan on Saturday convicted a man of sexual abuse of a minor girl and awarded 14 years rigorous imprisonment and Rs1 million fine to him.

Judge Ijaz Ahmad pronounced that Jan Mohammad was found to be guilty of subjecting the five-year-old to sexual abuse and therefore, he had been sentenced under Section 53 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010, and Section 377-A of the Pakistan Penal Code.

The court also declared that the prosecution had proved the charge of attempted rape against the accused, so he had been sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs100,000 under sections 376 and 511 of the PPC.

The FIR of the child abuse was registered by the Choora police station in Mardan on Jan 27, 2019, under Section 53 of the CPWA and sections 376 and 511 of the PPC.

Mardan court also convicted him of rape attempt

Complainant in the case was the girl’s father, who said his minor daughter went out of house to play with neighbours and when he stepped out to offer a prayer, he learned from the children that his daughter was taken away by a man, who had given her a Rs10 currency note.

He said he and his brother caught a man in a nearby sugarcane field after the girl was sexually assaulted by him.

The defense counsel claimed that the report of the medical examination of the alleged assault victim turned out to be negative with no marks of violence on her body.

He said the exercise to match the semen from the trousers of the accused and those of the girl wasn’t carried out to prove the commission of the offence by his client.

Overruling the arguments of the defence counsel, the court referred to the definition of ‘sexual abuse’ given in the CPWA and observed that no marks of violence or wound could only constitute the offence of sexual abuse.

It ruled that non-examination of the accused for the purpose of ascertaining his capability to commit sexual assault was also not necessary for the prosecution to establish the act of sexual abuse or attempt towards the commission of the offence of rape.

The court ruled that all witnesses were consistent in their deposition and no material contradiction had been found in their depositions.

It added that one of the witnesses was not related to the complainant and therefore, he was an independent and an impartial witness.

1643,656,985,https://www.dawn.com/news/1530860,1/27/20 23:26,Man arrested for allegedly raping minor girl in Muzaffarabad,"A 23-year-old man was arrested and booked by the police on Monday for allegedly raping a minor girl in a peripheral village of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) capital, Muzaffarabad.

The alleged rape occurred in Majhotar Kelgran village in the jurisdiction of Panjgran police station on Friday evening shortly after the 12-year-old victim had entered her family's byre to tether a goat, said Station House Officer (SHO) Mir Muzammil.

Panjgran is located around 35 kilometres northeast of Muzaffarabad along the main Neelum valley road on the left bank of River Neelum, while Majhotar Kelgran village is located across the river.

The SHO said that the suspect, who lived next door to the victim’s house, followed the victim into the byre and raped her there.

The victim, according to her statement to the police, resisted and shouted but there was no one to rescue her, as her mother was not at home at the time.

The suspect threatened to kill her if she narrated the incident to anyone, the SHO said, quoting her statement.

According to SHO Muzammil, on seeing the victim in pain the following evening, her mother inquired the reason and came to know about her ordeal.

“They are a very poor family. The victim’s father is doing some odd job in Karachi and her elder teenaged brother studies in a college in Muzaffarabad,” the SHO said.

“Perhaps they were [initially] reluctant to visit a police station but did it on Monday on the insistence or suggestion of some people from their biradri (clan) or village … I consoled and assured them that police would do their best to dispense justice to them,” he added.

The SHO said the suspect was arrested from his village after police recorded the statement(s) of the victim and her mother.

“The suspect, on coming to know about the police raid, went into hiding and his family also tried to resist his arrest but we got hold of him,” he said.

On Monday afternoon, police official Chanzeb Kiani brought the victim to Shaikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahayan Hospital Muzaffarabad for medical examination which, according to a provisional report, established that she had been sexually assaulted.

“She is in severe pain,” Kiani told Dawn from the hospital.

SHO Muzammil said the suspect, who had quit school in grade V, had memorised the Holy Quran from a seminary in Bahria Town Islamabad and was acquiring religious education from a seminary in Karachi for the past six years.

He had come home around two months ago and was attending to his father’s small shop alongside their home.

The SHO said although the suspect had denied having committed any such offence, preliminary grilling substantiated that he was foreswearing.

He added that the police had registered an FIR against him on the basis of the provisional medical report.

“We have booked him under Section 10(2) of the Zina Act and Section 452 of the Criminal Procedure Code and will produce him before a judicial magistrate on Tuesday for his physical remand,” he said.","['Tariq Naqash', 'Gul Hasan', 'Naseem Altaf', 'Ibrahim S', 'Images Staff', 'Khurram Husain', 'F.S.

He had killed the officer after an argument.

The killed suspect, Naveed Khan alias Nomi, was a “habitual criminal and hitman” who had killed three policemen among 11 persons and committed over 200 street crimes after being released after remission from court in 2017, said CTD official Raja Umar Khattab.

Investigation into the officer’s killing was carried out and the suspect was traced early on Thursday morning in Pehlwan Goth where he was killed in the ‘encounter.’

The suspect belonged to a local criminal gang known as Muddasir chief group in Pehlwan Goth.

The deceased was born in Gulistan-i-Jauhar and had remained involved in street crimes and targeted killings. He had three wives; out of them two were alleged criminals who belonged to ‘dacoit group.’ The suspect had also allegedly gunned down his maternal aunt, Mrs Nusrat Chaudhry, who was running a “notorious dacoit gang.” He had doubts that his aunt wanted to turn him in to law enforcers, therefore he gunned her down at ASF ground.

“The killed suspect belonged to a criminal family,” claimed the CTD official. His mother had married four times whose fourth husband, Sagheer Ahmed alias Goga, also committed street crimes along with the killed suspect. He was arrested by the police in 2006 along with his brother Sohail over charges of targeted killings and robberies.

He and his brother Sohail were awarded 25 years imprisonment over murder cases in Khwaja Ajmer Nagri and Gulberg areas. He had filed an appeal before Sindh High Court in 2017 and the high court granted him remission, therefore, he was released from prison after serving 11 years.

Mr Khattab said that the killed suspect was involved in 11 targeted killings including of three policemen and five workers/supporters of Muttahida Qaumi Move­ment in different parts of the metropolis.

Regarding motive of killing assistant sub-inspector Ghulam Mohammed in Saddar on July 23, the CTD official pointed out that intelligence sources revealed that a quarrel had taken place between the martyred officer and the suspect after collision between their motorbikes.

1655,668,1008,https://www.dawn.com/news/1560469/gender-inequalities,6/1/20 7:51,Gender inequalities,"THE coronavirus pandemic is anti-feminist. This seems a strange statement given that evidence suggests that men are worse affected by Covid-19. But in terms of broader social and economic considerations, the pandemic globally is expected to set women back decades. Pakistan’s deeply entrenched misogyny means we’re unlikely to do eno­u­­gh, if anything at all, to stop this backward slide.

The pandemic affects women at multiple levels, starting with significant health imp­acts. Health workers — 70 per cent of whom worldwide are women — are among the most vulnerable to being infected by Covid-19. But the health toll for women extends beyond the coronavirus itself. Previous health crises, such as the Ebola epidemic, have shown that resources are typically diverted to lifesaving health measures from women’s health and reproductive services. The UN has already highlighted that Covid-19 will disrupt its programmes providing family planning support and countering female genital mutilation and child marriage, resulting in millions of unwanted pregnancies, higher maternal mortality rates for years to come, and millions more girls being cut.

The Covid-19 crisis has also put the spotlight on the frequency and intensity of do­­mestic violence around the world — the UN Population Fund in April estimated a 20pc increase in violence during a three-month lockdown period. One can only imagine how much higher this figure would be if accounting for permissive societal attitudes towards domestic violence in countries like Pakistan.

The immediate effect of the virus on women will be in terms of workforce participation. Societal expectations globally means women will be likelier to give up or be fired from jobs as they take on additional caring responsibilities for out-of-school children, the elderly and sick along with mounting housework. Sadly, in patriarchal societies such as ours, this trend will not even be perceived as problematic.

There are sad reminders of how deeply rooted misogyny is.

It doesn’t help that women’s current positioning within the global economy will force them to opt out faster than men. The ILO reports that globally women represent 40pc of total employment, but make up 57pc of the cadre of part-time workers; 69pc of low earners are women. In South Asia, over 80pc of women who don’t work in agriculture are in informal employment, including domestic work and piece-rate manufacturing jobs. These are the workers most likely to lose their jobs and fail to qualify for government job protection schemes.

Women in formal employment also dominate in sectors worst-hit by the pandemic: air travel, tourism, retail, hospitality, catering. Citigroup last month estimated that globally, 220 million women are in sectors vulnerable to massive job cuts.

This does not mean that women’s economic contribution is expendable. Citigroup has also estimated $1 trillion could be lost from global growth as a result of women falling out of the workforce. The cost will be palpable in places like Pakistan, where the labour underutilisation rate for women pre-pandemic was already as high as 80pc, and where the IMF has estimated GDP would increase by one-third if women’s labour participation equalled that of men.

The world — especially emerging economies like Pakistan — cannot afford the in­­e­v­itable gender inequalities and pay gap that will result from this pandemic. That’s why development agencies are urging governments to take a gender-sensitive appro­ach to managing the pandemic and its economic consequences. This means focusing on saving jobs in the health, education and hospitality sectors (that employ women) and not only in male-intensive sectors such as construction.

Governments are also being asked to extend support to informal, part-time and seasonal workers, who are mostly women, and revisit maternity, flexible working, and sick pay policies, which could help retain women in employment.

This is asking a lot in a country where the prime minister recently sat silently by while a cleric blamed immodest women for causing the pandemic by eliciting God’s wrath. Or where in March the Aurat March was accused of obscenity. Or where parliamentarians routinely use sexist and threatening language to address their peers.

Two social media scandals this week have been sad reminders of how deep-seated Pakistani misogyny is. One especially disgusting meme suggests that a property tycoon will give a model who has filed harassment charges against his daughters a plot in a residential development — the accompanying image is that of a grave. Another Twitter firestorm depicts rape as a punishment for adulterous women. Such casual references to gender-based homicide and sexual violence seem acceptable in our public sphere, and indicate the low stature of women in our society. The socioeconomic ravages of the pandemic layered over entrenched patriarchy threaten to designate women as a permanent under-class. Will our government take action to prevent this?

Young Doctors Association (YDA) and paramedical staff began a demonstration from Civil Hospital and marched up to the chief minister's secretariat where they were met by baton-wielding policemen, who proceeded to baton-charge and arrest several doctors.

Talking to DawnNewsTV, YDA Balochistan President Yasir Achakzai confirmed that they had marched up to the CM's secretariat against a complete lack of protective gear for medical workers who were playing a key role in the country's fight against the novel coronavirus.

Achakzai said they were baton-charged by security forces, adding that ""dozens"" were arrested near the Red Zone. A few members of the Balochistan Assembly also reached the venue and tried to negotiate with the protesting doctors and paramedic staff.

Following the arrests, the YDA chief announced a boycott of young doctors' services from government hospitals. ""We suspend all our services following the high-handedness of police,"" Achakzai said in an emergency press conference.

Meanwhile, Quetta Deputy Inspector General of Police Razzaq Cheema confirmed the arrests of ""dozens"" of doctors but denied the use of batons against them.

""Yes, police arrested dozens of protesting doctors today,"" Cheema said. He denied the allegations that police had assaulted the protesting doctors but added that ""a scuffle broke out after the medics tried to cross barricades near the Red Zone"".

However, a video – which has been independently verified – is circulating on social media, which shows the police striking the doctors with batons and forcing them inside police vans.

""The protesting doctors have been shifted to various police stations in Quetta,"" DIG Cheema said.

The protest in Quetta comes a day after 13 doctors tested positive for Covid-19 in the provincial capital.

In a tweet, Balochistan Chief Minister Jam Kamal Khan announced that he met YDA doctors and assured them of his government's full cooperation in their battle against Covid-19 and in meeting their demands.

'State thuggery'

Soon after today's arrests, PML-N President and Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif in a tweet condemned the ""torture & arrest"" of doctors in Quetta, referring to police's actions as ""shameful behaviour"".

PPP co-chair Bilawal Bhutto Zardari also lashed out at the government for the violence against young doctors, terming the act “state thuggery”.

“Instead of providing them with the requisite protective gear, the government has sent them to jail. At a time when they are needed in hospitals, doctors have been sent to jails. What kind of justice is this?” questioned Bilawal.

He said rather than fulfilling their genuine demands, the PTI government is quashing their basic human rights.

Bilawal lamented that while doctors all around the world were being praised and supported for being on the front lines in the war against the virus, “Pakistan’s state is sending them to jails.”

Saluting the efforts of doctors in Pakistan for their services, Bilawal extended full support for Quetta’s doctors.

“The PPP is standing with you. Do not consider yourself alone,” he said in his statement.","['Ghalib Nihad', 'Syed Ali Shah', 'Dr. Usman', 'Syed H', 'Zaheer Khan', 'Desi Dimag', 'Kf Khan', 'Asif', 'A.

The victim’s father told the Airport police that two of his daughters were on their way to a seminary on Thursday when they were intercepted by two people in a car, who abducted his elder daughter.

He said his daughter was released by the kidnappers on Saturday.

When she returned home, she told her family that she was taken to an undisclosed location, confined there and raped by two people.

The victim was taken to a hospital by the police, after which an FIR was registered against the suspects, but they have yet to be arrested.

Separately, after three months the police on Sunday arrested a man who raped a woman and extorted her by blackmailing her with videos.

The victim’s husband, who lives in the Naseerabad police area, lodged an FIR with the police saying that his sister’s husband - who lives nearby - visited his home in his absence two and a half months ago and raped his wife at gunpoint and filmed her.

He said that because of the social stigma, the victim did not tell anyone what had happened while her alleged attacker blackmailed her and extorted Rs90,000 from her.

He added that in addition to extorting money, the alleged rapist came to their home and took rice and other edibles valued at Rs24,000 that the complainant used to earn his livelihood.

The complainant said the suspect continued to blackmail his wife and took her gold earrings, valued at Rs45,000.

A police spokesperson said the suspect will be produced in court for remand custody.

1703,716,1075,https://www.dawn.com/news/1586630,10/23/20 19:29,"Karachi court issues warrants for cleric, others in case involving rape, abduction and illicit marriage of minor girl","A Karachi court has taken cognisance of the marriage of an underage Christian girl, who was allegedly abducted and raped after being forcibly converted to Islam, it emerged on Friday.

The judge issued bailable warrants for the arrest of cleric Qazi Mufti Ahmed Jaan Raheemi — who allegedly performed the marriage of the girl when she was a teenager, her husband Muhammad Imran and his relatives Muhammad Rehan Baloch, Sundus and Azra. The suspects will be able to secure bail against a surety of Rs10,000 each, according to the judgement.

Police had booked five suspects, including two women, in a case pertaining to the alleged abduction and rape of the girl in Ittehad Town locality. The main suspect, Imran, was subsequently arrested.

The court's order came after the victim lodged a complaint against the suspects — including Imran, Baloch, Sundus, Azra and Raheemi — under Sections 3 (punishment for male contracting party), 4 (punishment for solemnising a child marriage) and 5 (punishment for parent or guardian concerned in a child marriage) of the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act, 2013.

Read: Age of consent

The matter came up before judicial magistrate (West) Wajid Ali Channa, who observed that the victim had recorded her statement under Section 200 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) while the statements of the witnesses had also been recorded in the case.

The judge noted that the statements of the witnesses duly supported the complainant's statement. “On careful examination of the statements recorded during preliminary inquiry, it appears that the complainant in her statement stated that she is less than 13 years [old] and she was not willing in the nikah with the accused Muhammad Imran.”

He further noted that the “nikah was solemnised without her consent under pressure, coercion and influence. Hence [...] the offence under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act, 2013, read with Section 200 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, is prima facie made out against the accused persons namely Muhammad Imran, Muhammad Rehan, Mst Sundus, Mst Azra and Qazi Mufti Ahmed Jaan Raheemi.”

The judge further observed that under the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act, 2013, the marriage of either party who is less than 18 years old is prohibited. ""In the circumstances, cognisance of the offence under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act, 2013, is hereby taken. Let the private complaint be admitted and brought on regular file and registered,” he ordered.

The judge directed the court office to issue bailable warrants for the arrest of the suspects and directed the suspects to ensure their presence before the court on October 26.

The complainant was told to file a list of the witnesses and obtain certified copies of their statements. The court asked the office to also provide copies of the documentary evidence to the suspects by the next date of the hearing.

Case history

In May 2019, three of the five suspects in the cases had easily escaped from the court after an additional district and sessions judge recalled the pre-arrest bail granted to them against a surety of Rs30,000 each.

The judge had noted at the time that according to the case record, the complainant was a minor. Recording her statement before the judicial magistrate, the victim had denied accepting Islam and execution of her free will in performing her nikah with suspect Imran.

The judge further stated that “she deposed that they (suspects) forcibly obtained her signatures on plain papers and the co-accused committed zina with her.”

Initially, a case was registered under Sections 365-B (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel for marriage etc), 376 (punishment for rape), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Ittehad Town police station on the complaint of the victim.","['Naeem Sahoutara', 'Niamet Ladak', 'A.

1813,826,1232,https://www.dawn.com/news/1586169,10/21/20 7:20,Sindh police top brass defer ‘protest leave’ after assurances,"• Army chief speaks to Bilawal after latter calls for inquiry

• COAS asks corps commander to probe ‘Karachi incident’

• IG House ‘siege’ sparks resentment within all ranks

• Maryam terms police protest ‘breaking the shackles of fear’

KARACHI: The Pakistan Peoples Party-led Sindh government on Tuesday averted one of the worst administrative crises after the top brass of police force decided to go on long leave in protest over the Oct 19 siege of Inspector General (IG) House that brought the law enforcement agency and security establishment in direct conflict, as PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari demanded Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa order institutional probe into the incident.

In a late night statement, Sindh Police said IG Sindh has decided to defer his own leave and ordered his officers to set aside their leave applications for 10 days in the larger national interest, pending the conclusion of an ‘impartial inquiry’ ordered by the army chief.

Hours before the en masse requests for leave by top police officers, including IG, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah had told a presser that a ministerial committee would investigate the mysterious ‘circumstances’ that led to the early morning raid on the hotel room of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz vice president Maryam Nawaz and arrest of her husband retired Capt Mohammad Safdar after the Pakistan Democratic Movement’s Bagh-i-Jinnah rally, but defended the police action once an FIR had been lodged against him.

However, the presser failed to convince the police hierarchy that was in low morale following the Oct 19 episode, compelling the PPP chairman to address a media conference on the issue. He said: “I demand DG ISI Faiz Hameed and Chief of Army Staff Gen Bajwa investigate your institution [and] how it is operating in this province. All officers of Sindh police are wondering who were the people who surrounded the Sindh police chief’s house in the early hours of Monday. Who were those two men who entered into his home at 4am in the morning and took him to an unspecified location?”

Flanked by provincial ministers during a presser earlier at CM House, the chief minister had announced that the Sindh government was constituting a committee to probe the matter. “Names have not been finalised but there will be three to five ministers [in the committee],” Mr Shah announced. He also accused Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers of a “conspiracy” to pressure police to book the son-in-law of ex-premier Nawaz Sharif and alleged that the complainant of the FIR enjoyed support from the PTI leadership.

Sharing findings of the police investigation to prove the alleged mala fide intention behind the move of the ruling party at Centre, CM Shah said: “The PTI MPAs under a preplanned conspiracy brought a proclaimed offender at the police station and got him to lodge a fake FIR against Capt (retired) Safdar.” He explained that leaders of the opposition PML-N, including Capt Safdar visited Mazar-i-Quaid to pay tribute at around 4.30pm on October 18. “The CDR [Calls Detail Report] of complainant Waqas Ahmed shows that at 4.30pm on October 18 he was at Baqai University, off the Superhighway. When the complainant was not present on the spot, at the Mazar, how did Capt Safdar threaten him with dire consequences?”

A few of the written requests for long leave from senior police officers went viral on the social media. One of the initial requests came from Additional IG Imran Yaqoob Minhas, who sought two-month leave, mentioning that he was finding it “quite difficult” to discharge duty “in professional manner” after the police high was “ridiculed and mishandled”.

“In such a stressful situation, it is quite difficult for me to discharge my duty in a professional manner,” Additional IG Minhas stated. Then followed the storm of leave requests from a number of police officers. Around 100 officers including Additional IG, 25 DIGs and 30 SSPs requested for long leave with reports of the same written request from Sindh IG Mushtaq Mehar pending before the Sindh Chief Minister.

Amid efforts by media to ascertain the unfolding situation in Sindh, PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz made things easy for many through her tweet. While saluting the Sindh police, she called the development “breaking the shackles of fear”.

“I salute the Sindh Police,” she tweeted and then quoted the 1948 speech of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s speech: “If you want to raise the prestige and greatness of Pakistan, you must not fall victim to any pressure, but do your duty as servants to the people and the State, fearlessly and honestly.”

She also thanked Mr Bhutto-Zardari for his clear stance and tweeted: “It’s heartening to see civilians breaking shackles of fear, standing up for supremacy of constitution & reclaiming their long lost rights. The conspiracy & conspirators stand badly exposed. Thank you @BBhuttoZardari for your support & clear stance. Pakistan has changed.”

Her father and former premier Nawaz Sharif took the opportunity to call the events in Karachi as “endorsement” of his narrative, but this time he addressed unnamed individuals or organisations accusing them of defaming the armed forces.

“Karachi events endorse our narrative “State above the Stats. You ridiculed mandate of provincial govt; Trampled on sanctity of family privacy; Abducted senior police officers to extort orders; Defamed our Armed Forces; Addl IGP’s letter proves that you subverted the Constitution,” he tweeted.

Amid all the speculations and media noise, the Sindh Police, however, remained tight-lipped with no official statement over the developing situation that mostly revolved around the IG and his officers.

Before the crisis could deepen, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari decided to address the media in the evening at his residence Bilawal House that settled the dust to some extent and helped understanding the reasons behind the saga.

While admitting “embarrassment” for the raid on Maryam’s hotel room and condemning the arrest of her husband, the PPP chairman directly addressed the COAS Gen Bajwa and director general of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in his press conference. “Our police officers are wondering that what’s going on,” he said.

“I demand of DG ISI Faiz Hameed and Chief of Army Staff Gen Bajwa to investigate your institution [and] how it is operating in this province. All officers of Sindh Police are wondering who were the people who surrounded the Sindh police chief’s house in the early hours of Monday? Who were those two men who entered into his home at 4am in the morning and took him to an unspecified location?”

The move apparently worked, as the army chief immediately took notice of the situation and ordered an inquiry into the “Karachi incident”. In a brief statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that he directed the Corps Commander of Karachi to inquire into the matter. The COAS, it said, had directed Karachi Corps Commander to immediately inquire into the circumstances to determine the facts and report back as soon as possible. It didn’t end here.

After a few minutes, the Bilawal House came up with a brief piece of information about the phone contact between the COAS and the PPP chairman that further defused the growing tension between security establishment and law enforcement agency. The conversation ended on promises from one side and appreciation from the other.

“Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa called PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari over the telephone to discuss the Karachi incident this evening,” it said. “The chairman PPP expressed his appreciation to the COAS for taking prompt notice of the Karachi incident and his assurance of conducting a transparent inquiry on the incident.”

In an attempt to woo back the “demoralized” and “shocked” police force, the PPP chairman along with CM chief minister and provincial ministers visited the IG residence later in the night. Mr Bhutto-Zadari shared a picture of his visit on Twitter showing him in a group photo with IG Maher, senior police officers and Sindh ministers. “I stand in solidarity with Sindh Police, do you?” he tweeted.

Later a statement issued by the Bilawal House said that the PPP chairman spent some time with Sindh police officers, lauded the role of law enforcement agency for its role in maintaining peace and fight against terror and expressed solidarity with its personnel.

“I have been assured by army chief about transparent investigation into Karachi incident,” the statement quoted the PPP chairman as telling the Sindh IG and other officers.

Sindh police tweet

In a late night tweet, Sindh Police stated: “The unfortunate incident that occurred on the night of 18/19 October caused great heartache and resentment within all ranks of Sindh Police. As a result, IG Sindh decided to proceed on leave and subsequently all ranks decided that they would also apply for leave to protest the humiliation meted out to Sindh police. This was a spontaneous and heartfelt reaction and made on an individual rather than a collective basis, because every single member of the department felt an acute sense of disrespect. Sindh police is immensely grateful to the Army Chief for realising the sense of hurt that prevailed within a uniformed force, and for promptly ordering an inquiry into the matter, which he has also assured will be impartial in order to restore the prestige of Sindh police. Sindh Police is also grateful to the chairman of the PPP Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and the honourable CM Sindh for coming to the IG House and showing solidarity with the police leadership.

“Sindh police has always been a disciplined force which believes in institutional harmony between all key national institutions and has always been cognisant of its responsibility to serve and protect the citizens of this province and thus, keeping this in mind, IG Sindh has decided to defer his own leave and ordered his officers to set aside their leave applications for ten days in the larger national interest, pending the conclusion of the inquiry.”

Mahboob Abbasi, who is the victim's father, told Dawn that Akhtar had made telephonic contact with him after the FIR was lodged and protesters had gathered outside the press club.

Abbasi said later Wasim Akhtar along with his son, Taimur Wasim, had visited his residence in Clifton, where MPA Nusrat Abbasi, former bureaucrat Dr Shafqat Abbasi and senior politicians including Syed Ghulam Shah and Asif Baladi were also present.

""The mayor admitted his son's mistake and apologised for his behaviour,"" Abbasi said, adding that ""my son and I have accepted the apology and will withdraw the case filed against Taimur"".

Abbasi said Akhtar, while issuing his apology, insisted that such an incident should never have happened.

An official of the Darakshan police station had earlier told Dawn that the mayor's son, Taimur Wasim, and around eight to 10 others, including his guards, were booked for beating up 19-year-old student, Hasnain Haider, on the night of Dec 31.

The complainant said he was a resident of Clifton who along with his friend was waiting for other friends at a petrol pump in Phase-VIII of DHA when two Vigo vehicles arrived there at around 10pm on Dec 31. Around eight to 10 persons including security guards were travelling in the vehicles. They allegedly resorted to aerial firing, the complainant said, adding that when he inquired about the gunfire and abusive language, they again resorted to firing.

He said that he and his friends left the place in their car but were intercepted by the two Vigo vehicles near Hamza mosque. After stopping their car, the guards who disembarked from their vehicles along with Taimur Wasim told the complainant that he was the son of Karachi Mayor Wasim Akhtar. The complainant said he was beaten up by the guards and Taimur who allegedly used a pistol to hit him. The guards also smashed the windowpanes of the car. They attempted to force him to sit in their vehicle, he claimed, but on the resistance of his friends, the suspects hurled threats and abuse at them before rushing away.","['Imtiaz Ali', 'Tahir A', 'Mateen Mirza', 'Safdar Akbari', 'M.

The complainant said he was beaten up by the guards and Taimur who allegedly used a pistol to hit him.","['assaulted', 'vehicles', 'karachi', 'abbasi', 'wasim', 'guards', 'akhtar', 'mayor', 'apologises', 'taimur', 'told', 'son', 'boy', 'complainant', 'family']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189f00b83e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0d52ba8a43.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/medium/2016/05/572b433b885e2.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/01/5e107c373fa0e.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/01/5e1021d685e34.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/01/5e1021d685e34.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21824a8678.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2018/08/5b73da17c8db5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189916390d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0ec56aad75.jpg', 'http://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/05/572b433b885e2.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd22283a73d3.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18a3ece187.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/01/5e107c373fa0e.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2018/08/5b73da17c8db5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f94d8916a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f4142e469.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24c3aad888.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24e90196c5.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/01/5e107c373fa0e.png,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Victim\'s father says they have ""accepted"" the apology and will withdraw FIR against mayor\'s son.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1526248', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Karachi mayor apologises to family of boy his son assaulted', 'description': 'Victim\'s father says they have ""accepted"" the apology and will withdraw FIR against mayor\'s son.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/01/5e107c373fa0e.png'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1526248', 'title': 'Karachi mayor apologises to family of boy his son assaulted', 'description': 'Victim\'s father says they have ""accepted"" the apology and will withdraw FIR against mayor\'s son.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/01/5e107c373fa0e.png'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-01-04 16:49:26', 'modified_time': '2020-01-04 19:04:55', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/1200/imtiaz-ali'}, 'author': 'Imtiaz Ali'})",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dawn,,2020-01-04
1881,894,1321,https://www.dawn.com/news/1584688,10/12/20 19:35,Main suspect in motorway gang-rape case arrested from Faisalabad,"The main suspect of the Lahore-Sialkot motorway gang-rape case, Abid Malhi, was arrested by police on Monday, police officials confirmed.

Abid was arrested from Faisalabad and is being shifted to Lahore, Hasnain Haider, a deputy superintendent (DSP) of the Crime Investigation Agency (CIA), said.

The arrest comes a little over a month after the incident, that had sparked outrage across the country.

The development was confirmed in a tweet by prime minister's special assistant Shahbaz Gill, who said that the suspect will be punished according to law.

Last month, two robbers on the Lahore-Sialkot motorway had gang-raped a mother of two in front of her children in an area falling within the Gujjarpura police jurisdiction. The incident caused a countrywide outpouring of anger and brought sexual violence against women into national focus. Abid and Shafqat Ali alias Bagga — who is on judicial remand— are the main suspects in the case.

Abid, who was leading a gang of four, is also wanted to police in at least 10 other criminal cases registered at various police stations of Punjab.

The news was welcomed by President Arif Alvi, who termed the arrest ""a matter of national relief"".

""An efficient trial of the accused and the 'severest exemplary' punishment possible under the law must be given to all those found guilty,"" the president said in a tweet. ""Let everyone feel safe in Pakistan, specially our women and children.""

Case details

Shafqat, whose arrest was announced by Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, was sent to prison on a 14-day judicial remand by an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore a day after he was detained by the police.

Shafqat was arrested after the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Police raided a house in Okara district. He confessed to the crime before his DNA matched the samples collected from the crime scene.

A senior officer had told Dawn that the CTD carried out an intelligence-based operation (IBO) and arrested Shafqat from his sister’s house in Depalpur. He further said that Abid had called Shafqat many times before and after committing the rape.

During interrogation, Shafqat told detectives that Abid had first raped the woman and then asked him to commit the offence while threatening him that he would shoot him (Shafqat) for not committing the crime or showing sympathy for the victim.

As they had just raped the woman, they noticed the personnel of the Dolphin Squad reaching the spot, the official said. As soon as a Dolphin official fired a warning shot into the air, both the suspects fled the scene and hid in a nearby jungle of Karol Ghati for two hours or so to avoid arrest. Then they left the place and reached Sheikhupura at the home of Abid Ali at Ghazi Kot, Qila Sattar Shah, in tehsil Ferozewala of Sheikhupura district. Abid had purchased this two-marla house some three years back.

Both Abid and Shafqat turned their mobile phones off. Shafqat left Abid’s house and reached Depalpur where he was employed at a cold storage. As more news of the crime appeared in the media, he preferred to stay away from his workplace and hid himself in the house of his sister who was probably unaware of his involvement in the crime, the officer informed Dawn. Abid also fled his house and went underground to avoid arrest when he came to know about the massive media coverage.

The third suspect, identified as Iqbal alias Bala, was “arrested” on the information provided by Shafqat during interrogation, an official had told Dawn. The official said he was not directly involved in the rape case, but being an active member of the gang he might disclose possible hideouts of Abid.

A fourth suspect, Waqarul Hasan, had surrendered to police while claiming his innocence and requested the authorities to conduct his DNA test to corroborate his claim.

The Lahore police reportedly released relatives and friends of two other suspects — Waqarul Hassan and his brother in-law Abbas — who were detained in connection with the case.","['Abdul Khalique', 'Free Expression', 'Ahsan Gul', 'Pakistan Zindabad', 'Azam', 'Ali Da Malanga', 'Bharat', 'French Fries', 'Chrís Dăń', 'Sabir Shah']","The main suspect of the Lahore-Sialkot motorway gang-rape case, Abid Malhi, was arrested by police on Monday, police officials confirmed.

1891,904,1343,https://www.dawn.com/news/1533010,2/7/20 14:08,NA passes contentious resolution calling for public hanging of child sexual abusers,"A resolution calling for the public hanging of offenders convicted for sexually abusing and murdering children was passed in the National Assembly on Friday with a majority of votes.

The session was presided over by Deputy Speaker Qasim Khan Suri.

The hand-written resolution, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, referred to the ""brutal killing of 8-year-old Iwaz Noor in Nowshera"".

""Strongly condemning"" the death, the signatories wrote: ""This house [...] demands that to stop these shameful and brutal killings of children and give a strong deterrent effect, the killers and rapists should not only be given death penalty by hanging but they should be hanged publicly.""

Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan presented the resolution in the parliament, which was passed by all lawmakers, apart from PPP's.

Raja Pervez Ashraf, PPP leader and former prime minister, said: ""Ramping up the severity of punishments does not result in a reduction in crime.""

""We cannot put public hanging into practice as it violates the laws of the United Nations,"" he added, reminding members of the parliament that Pakistan is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

He was not the only one to raise his voice against the passing of the resolution. Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry ""strongly condemned"" it.

""This is just another grave act in line with brutal civilisation practices. Societies act in a balanced way. Barbarism is not the answer to crimes [...] this is another expression of extremism,"" he wrote on Twitter.

Meanwhile, Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari clarified that the resolution ""was not government-sponsored but an individual act"".

""Many of us oppose it — our MOHR (Ministry of Human Rights) strongly opposes this. Unfortunately I was in a meeting and wasn't able to go to NA,"" she said, in a post on Twitter.

According to a report released by child rights organisation Sahil in September last year, 1,304 cases of sexual abuse of children were reported by the media in the country from January to June.

This means that at least seven children are abused every day.

With the issue continuing to remain widely prevalent, the government has been met with criticism for not taking any concrete measures to address flaws in the investigation of such cases or the implementation of the relevant laws.

Perspective: Why sexual abuse of children remains widely prevalent

Existing laws

Presently, multiple laws are available in the country for dealing with child-related offences.

Punjab was the first province where a law on child protection was enacted in 2004. The Punjab Destitute and Neglected Children Act, 2004, deals with a variety of issues related to child protection. The law gives a definition of ‘destitute and neglected child.’

Under this law, a child protection and welfare bureau has to be set up with wide-ranging functions. The bureau has also to set up child protection institutions in different areas.

The KP Child Protection and Welfare Act (CPWA) was enacted in 2010. This law is more comprehensive than that of Punjab. The KP law included several offences against children with prescribed punishments. The offences incorporated in the Act include: child pornography, sexual abuse, sale in child organs, corporal punishment and child begging and trafficking.

The KP Act provides for setting up of child protection bodies, including child protection courts, the Child Protection and Welfare Commission, child protection units on district level, child protection institute, etc.

The Sindh Child Protection Authority Act, 2011, was enacted in June 2011. This law makes it binding on the provincial government to establish Sindh Child Protection Authority, which is chaired by minister for social welfare. The authority has to set up child protection units and also appoint child protection officers. However, this law is not as comprehensive as that of KP and Punjab.

Balochistan Child Protection Act, 2016, was enacted in November 2016. This law includes definitions of different categories of violence against children, including mental violence, physical violence, sexual abuse and exploitation, etc. It provides for setting up of a child protection commission on provincial level and child protection units on district level.

Several important amendments were made in Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) through the Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Act, 2016, which was enacted in March 2016. Some of the provisions included in PPC are similar to the one available in KP CPWA, including offences related to exposure to seduction, child pornography, sexual abuse, etc.

Similarly, new sections 377A and 377B were incorporated in PPC in which a detailed definition of sexual abuse and its punishment are given.

In 2018, an amendment was made in Section 377B of the PPC to make the punishment for sexual abuse more stringent. It now provides imprisonment which shall not be less than 14 years and may extend to 20 years with minimum fine of Rs1 million.

Similarly, in the 2016 amendments the offence of child pornography was made punishable to minimum two years imprisonment and maximum seven years besides fine.

However, through amendments in 2018, the said offence was made punishable with at least 14 years imprisonment and maximum 20 years imprisonment with minimum fine of Rs1 million.

Moreover, in 2016 death penalty was introduced for raping a minor. The Criminal Law (Amendment) (Offences related to rape) Act, 2016, was introduced in 2016.

Under those amendments, a sub-section 3 was included in Section 376 of the PPC which provides: “Whoever commits rape of a minor or a person with mental or physical disability shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life.”","['Javed Hussain', 'Prakash Jha', 'Changez Khan', 'Dr Vikas Jamwal', 'Merge Of Equals', 'Common Sense', 'Adil Mustafa', 'Jimmy Thappa', 'Blue Knight', 'Salim Khan']","The offences incorporated in the Act include: child pornography, sexual abuse, sale in child organs, corporal punishment and child begging and trafficking.
The KP Act provides for setting up of child protection bodies, including child protection courts, the Child Protection and Welfare Commission, child protection units on district level, child protection institute, etc.

1908,921,1376,https://www.dawn.com/news/1584048,10/9/20 7:15,"Lawmakers’ body discusses minorities’ rights bill, forced conversion","KARACHI: Several members of the Parliamentary Committee to Protect Minorities from Forced Conversions as well as representatives of minority communities of Sindh from Ghotki, Sukkur and Hyderabad met at the Sindh Secretariat on Thursday to discuss the Sindh Minorities Rights Commission Bill.

The major issues of minority communities were identified as forced conversion and kidnapping of minority girls and women at the top of the list followed by the need for implementation of five per cent quota reserved for minorities in government jobs, inclusion of religious books of minorities in curriculum, provision of security to sensitive minorities’ religious places, registration of minorities’ religious places and their maintenance and improvement of the social and economic conditions of minorities.

Forced conversion is one of the burning issues of minorities.

During 2020, six controversial cases of alleged adoption and forced conversion of Hindu girls were reported. Mehak and Lata Kumari were kidnapped in Jacobabad, Sormi and Shanti were kidnapped in Tharparkar, Simran went missing from Pano Akil and Parsha Kumari was kidnapped in Khairpur. The cases of abduction were proceeded in courts of law, and the girls were said to have wilfully solemnised marriage in accordance with Shariah law.

Bill will provide a platform to look into various grievances of minority communities

It was explained that the Sindh government was fully committed to protecting the fundamental rights of minorities as provided in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan under Article-25, and that several steps had already been taken to stop forced conversions and kidnapping of minorities’ girls and women. The Sindh Hindus Marriage (Amendment) Act of 2018 is included in these steps to control such incidents followed by other bills and acts that have been introduced for legislation such as the Sindh Minorities Rights Commission Bill of 2019 and the Criminal Law (Protection of Minorities) Bill of 2019.

The Sindh Minorities Rights Commission Bill will provide a platform to look into various grievances of minority communities as well as to lay down mechanisms for promotion and protection of identity of minorities at the provincial level. The Criminal Law (Protection of Minorities) Bill was introduced to recognise the rights of freedom of religion of all persons as well as to restrict forced conversion. Both these bills are currently under process in the law department for legislation, and were hence under discussion at the meeting.

While appreciating the bills moved already, Senator Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar, the chairman of the Parliamentary Committee to Protect Minorities from Forced Conversions, said that while their mandate focussed on stopping forced conversions, there were still other issues concerning minorities that they were also not shying away from and that there was always room for improvement everywhere and therefore, they also wanted to hear from representatives of minority communities.

He said that whoever was behind forced conversions was not Muslim as Islam does not allow forced conversion.

“However, wilful conversion is another matter,” he said, adding that when there was a marriage contract between people of different religions it also gives way to issues of society and the parents of the individuals.

He also asked that if a girl, who may be over 18 years of age, leaves her home why does she feel threatened and why does she seek help from politicians. Why are the state’s institutions not being able to give her confidence to approach them for helping her out? “The Quaid-i-Azam’s speech of August 11, 1947 is important here. It is our responsibility to not allow compromise on the dignity of the minorities. We are not turning away from Shariah in doing so,” he said.

“There have been suggestions about age determination of these girls who are said to be forcefully converted. But age doesn’t really address the issue here. When a Muslim girl goes into nikah in the presence of a wali or guardian, then why doesn’t a girl from a minority have a wali by her side when she is going into the contract of marriage?” He questioned.

Federal Minister for Religious and Inter-faith Harmony MNA Noor-ul-Haq Qadri said that they did not deny incidence of forced conversions, but there might be some exaggeration here of what was actually happening.

“There are very few cases of forced conversions in Punjab and there are none in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. What is happening in Sindh, specifically what is happening in Sindh with the Hindu community?” He asked.

“We bring religion into everything. But our religion is against forceful conversions. The issue here is the non-implementation of laws to stop such wrongdoing. Awareness is also needed regarding the issue of forced conversions,” he said.

Dr Sikandar Mandhro said that they already had laws for kidnapping and abduction cases and a marriage law. “Now we need to be clear about forced conversions. We need a specific law for preventing it. It should be a law that all stakeholders would agree with,” he said.

MNA Dr Darshan also added that the law should be such that it should be respected by all. He also reminded that the country’s image was tarnished internationally due to incidents of forced conversions here.

MPA from Sindh Nand Kumar Goplani said that bill looks like a shortcut document to him. “Some 80 per cent of the original bill of 2016 is not there.” He also asked for the inclusion of members of the minority community in lawmaking.

MNA Naveed Aamir Jeeva pointed out that Sindh’s data on forced conversion was missing the cases of Christian girls. “I suggest you get your data from Nadra. It will give you the real picture of forced conversions,” he said.

MNA Kesoo Mal Kheeal Das Kohistani said that he did not see the seriousness in the Sindh government that was needed to deal with the situation. “Things here are being taken very lightly by the law enforcement agencies too,” he said, adding that there was also a need for changing mind-set here.

The Chief Minister’s Adviser on Law Barrister Murtaza Wahab said forced conversions were not only wrong religiously, but also ethically. “Such force is not acceptable. And that is why this legislation is sent to the chief minister. But even though it carried a political consensus, it didn’t sit well with religious scholars, which caused a problem with the bill,” he said.

“Then even if there is a set law against the practice in Sindh, what happens when these girls are taken to Islamabad or Punjab? There is no such law there, and thus these places are out of our jurisdiction. The marriage age for girls is also different there,” he pointed out.

‘Need for national consensus’

“Therefore there is a need for national consensus here,” he added.

Earlier, the meeting was also apprised of the initiatives taken by the Minorities Affairs Department such as provision of financial grants for the poor, needy and deserving people of minority communities in Sindh, Annual Development Programme (ADP) schemes for their benefit, establishment of grievance/facilitation desks at the divisional level, provision of protection of religious places of minorities, legislation, etc.

1949,962,1433,https://www.dawn.com/news/1581212,9/23/20 13:33,Police arrest journalist outside IHC,"Islamabad police on Wednesday arrested a reporter who had arrived at the high court to cover a hearing of an appeal filed by Maryam Nawaz against her conviction in the Avenfield corruption reference.

Ehtisham Kiyani, who works for Channel 24, was arrested by police officials deployed for security and was shifted to Ramna police station. He was stopped at a police checkpoint outside the court where he introduced himself but was detained by officials. After arresting him, police claimed that Kiyani was carrying weapons.

Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Athar Minallah took notice of the incident and summoned high-ranking officials of the capital police and ordered Kiyani's immediate release. The reporter was released soon after and Superintendent of Police Sarfaraz Virk said that no weapons had been recovered from Kiyani, adding that a private TV channel had reported ""fake news"".

Speaking to reporters after his release, Kiyani said that he was falsely accused of bearing weapons. He added that he was detained by police for over an hour, during which he was ""tortured"" and ""harassed"".

""I was mistreated by SP Zubair Sheikh,"" he said. Kiyani further said that police took away his mobile phone and wallet. Despite multiple requests, he was not allowed to contact his family or his office colleagues, Kiyani told reporters.

He said that police's attitude with journalists was ""insulting"" and demanded Islamabad's inspector general to take notice of the treatment meted out to media personnel by law enforcement officials.

1966,979,1459,https://www.dawn.com/news/1591257/australian-special-forces-allegedly-killed-39-unarmed-afghans-report,11/19/20 20:05,Australian special forces allegedly killed 39 unarmed Afghans: report,"Australian special forces allegedly killed 39 unarmed prisoners and civilians in Afghanistan, with senior commandos reportedly forcing junior soldiers to kill defenceless captives in order to “blood” them for combat, a four-year investigation found.

Australia said on Thursday that 19 current and former soldiers will be referred for potential criminal prosecution for allegedly killing the 39 Afghan locals.

Detailing the findings of a long-awaited inquiry into the conduct of special forces personnel in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016, Australia's General Angus John Campbell said there was credible information of 39 unlawful killings by 25 Australian Special Forces personnel in 23 separate incidents. All of those kills were outside the “heat of battle”, Campbell said.

“These findings allege the most serious breaches of military conduct and professional values,” Campbell told reporters in Canberra.

“The unlawful killing, of civilians and prisoners is never acceptable.”

The report said the majority of those killed, which included prisoners, farmers and other Afghan locals, were captured when they were killed and therefore protected under international law.

Following the recommendations of the report, Campbell said 19 current and former members of Australia's military will be referred to a soon-to-be appointed special investigator to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to prosecute.

Australia's Minister for Defence Linda Reynolds said last week that Canberra had been advised that local prosecution would negate charges at the International Criminal Court at The Hague.

'Blooding'

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had earlier warned the report would include “difficult and hard news for Australians”, but few expected some of the most shocking revelations.

While the report was heavily redacted, it included allegations that senior special forces personnel ordered the killing of unarmed Afghans.

“There is credible information that junior soldiers were required by their patrol commanders to shoot a prisoner, in order to achieve the soldier's first kill, in a practice that was known as 'blooding',” the report read.

Once a person had been killed, those allegedly responsible would stage a fight scene with foreign weapons or equipment to justify their action, the report concluded.

The actions did not immediately come to light due to what the report concluded was a culture of secrecy and compartmentalisation in which information was kept and controlled within patrols.

The veil of secrecy was a key reason that the allegations took so long to come to light.

Although it has been the subject of rumour, Australia's official investigation only began after the publication of classified documents about alleged war crimes in Afghanistan.

A former military lawyer, David McBride, has been charged with providing the classified papers to the Australian Broadcasting Corp. He admits that he supplied the papers, but says it is in the national interest.

The four-year inquiry was conducted by New South Wales state Judge Paul Brereton, who was appointed by the Inspector-General of Defence in 2016 to investigate rumours of war crimes in Afghanistan between 2003 and 2016.

The inquiry examined more than 20,000 documents and 25,000 images, and interviewed 423 witnesses under oath.

The report recommended Canberra should compensate victims' families even without a successful prosecution.

Campbell said he would seek to revoke citations for special operations task groups that served in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2013.

The release of the report came after Morrison spoke with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.

“The Prime Minister of Australia expressed his deepest sorrow over the misconduct by some Australian troops in Afghanistan,” Ghani's office wrote on Twitter.

Australia has had troops in Afghanistan since 2002 as part of the US-led coalition fighting the Taliban militia.

Australia has about 1,500 troops remaining in Afghanistan.","['Imtiaz Ali Khan', 'Taimoor Khan', 'Dr. Salaria', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Kit Kit', 'Ashraf The Great', 'Hamza Alam', 'Fawad Bhai', 'Zeeshan Ahmed', 'Riffat Rashid']","Australian special forces allegedly killed 39 unarmed prisoners and civilians in Afghanistan, with senior commandos reportedly forcing junior soldiers to kill defenceless captives in order to “blood” them for combat, a four-year investigation found.

1967,980,1460,https://www.dawn.com/news/1561843,6/7/20 6:49,Punjab police use stun therapy on SOP violators,"FAISALABAD: Despite opposition by international human rights bodies like the Amnesty International (AI), stun batons are being used with impunity by local police and other law-enforcement agencies against those flouting Covid-19 related standard operating procedures (SOPs), obviously with the consent of a government whose job is to procure and supply these torture tools to law enforcers.

Stun guns and stun batons are gadgets that inflict a high-frequency shock to the victim, causing loss of balance and muscle control, mental confusion and disorientation, if for only a few seconds.

On Saturday, the district administration and police were witnessed using stun batons on the city roads against those flouting Covid-19 SOPs, especially those who were not wearing masks.

The Amnesty International (AI) is campaigning worldwide for banning the use and trade of torture tools like stun baton, stun belts, spike batons, neck cuffs etc. It argues that no one should profit from pain and suffering of people.

The AI also demands that the United Nations member states should work towards regulations aimed at ending the torture tools trade for good.

Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Ali and Senior Superintendent of Police (operations) Syed Ali Raza led their subordinates on various city roads, including Jail Road and Chenab Chowk where people, mostly motorcyclists and those traveling by motorcycle-rickshaws, not wearing masks, were lined up facing walls and subjected to stun baton shocks.

This new mode of public torture, carried out by plainclothesmen, terrorised the people, besides causing pain to those declared as violators.

According to the AI, gadgets like stun baton come handy for state officials to inflict painful electric shocks to the bodies of the targeted people without leaving any long-lasting physical traces.

Aslam, a motorcyclist who was subjected to such torture on Jail Road, narrating his ordeal said: “I was going on a bike with a friend when a man carrying a strange-looking baton approached us and asked us to line up against a wall along the road. He asked why I was not wearing a mask. Before I could answer, he gave me an electric shock with the baton, causing me immense pain. It was so sudden and painful that for a few seconds I felt like I was dying.”

He said the shock left him in a daze for a couple of minutes.

“The official could have imposed a fine or even arrested me, instead of inflicting an electric shock that might cause me a serious physical harm,” he lamented. This scribe tried to contact the deputy commissioner and the SSP for their versions on their phones but the officers did not reply.

A police officer, seeking anonymity, said the higher authorities were quite aware of the use of stun batons to control violators and protesters as these gadgets were procured and provide to various departments on their orders.

Justifying the use of stun batons, he said these would be helpful in keeping the people indoors during the pandemic and making them follow the SOPs in public places.

Meanwhile, through a handout, the district administration has warned those leaving their homes without masks of strict action.

The administration also sealed shops in different areas of the city for violation of the SOPs.

At some places, the traffic police employees deflated tyres of vehicles of those who were not wearing masks.

The district administration spokesman said the gadgets had been procured by the civil defense department to control coronavirus patients housed in Paras Quarantine Centre. He claimed the device gave 4 to 5 watts shock and had no side effects.

Following a recent complaint, he claimed, the district administration had banned its use by civil defense staff, adding “it should be used for the purpose for which it was purchased”.

Meanwhile, through a handout, the district administration has warned those leaving their homes without masks of strict action.","['ai', 'baton', 'batons', 'torture', 'wearing', 'punjab', 'administration', 'district', 'therapy', 'stun', 'gadgets', 'shock', 'violators', 'sop']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189f00b83e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0d52ba8a43.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/06/5edc8af182308.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/05/5eb23d1d53c26.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/05/5ebebf9a2b017.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/06/5ed8874137df9.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/05/5eb23d1d53c26.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21824a8678.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189916390d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/05/5ebebf9a2b017.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/06/5ed8874137df9.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0ec56aad75.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd22283a73d3.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18a3ece187.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/06/5edc8af182308.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f94d8916a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f4142e469.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24c3aad888.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24e90196c5.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/06/5edc8af182308.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Stun guns and stun batons are gadgets that inflict a high-frequency shock to the victim.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1561843', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Punjab police use stun therapy on SOP violators', 'description': 'Stun guns and stun batons are gadgets that inflict a high-frequency shock to the victim.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/06/5edc8af182308.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1561843', 'title': 'Punjab police use stun therapy on SOP violators', 'description': 'Stun guns and stun batons are gadgets that inflict a high-frequency shock to the victim.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/06/5edc8af182308.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-06-07 06:49:54', 'modified_time': '2020-06-07 11:38:03', 'tag': 'Coronavirus', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/5894/saleem-mubarak'}, 'keywords': 'Coronavirus', 'news_keywords': 'Coronavirus', 'author': 'Saleem Mubarak'})",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dawn,,2020-06-07

2013,1026,1542,https://www.dawn.com/news/1588524/forced-conversion,11/4/20 7:23,Forced conversion,"AN important case is being heard at the Sindh High Court, one that has a critical bearing on the rights of minorities, particularly the thorny question of religious conversion when it goes hand in hand with underage marriage.

A Christian girl named Arzoo recently sought a court injunction to prevent the registration of a kidnapping case against a man with whom she had undergone a nikah ceremony, and his family. She had claimed in an affidavit that she was 18 years of age and was ‘marrying’ him after converting to Islam of her own free will.

However, apparently incontrovertible documentary evidence has emerged that shows Arzoo is a 13-year-old child. On Monday night, the police said they had arrested the purported ‘husband’, recovered the girl and were moving her to a shelter home for three days as ordered by the court.

There have been many incidents over the past few years in which families of girls from minority communities, usually Hindus living in interior Sindh, have alleged that their daughters were forcibly converted before being married to Muslim men. More often than not, the ‘brides’ are underage girls.

According to the law, the minimum age for marriage in Sindh is 18 years; there are no exceptions or mitigating circumstances. The Child Marriages Restraint Act mandates prison terms and fines for the male contracting party as well as those who perform the nikah or in any way facilitate such a union.

The problem seems to arise, however, when religious conversion is involved. At present there is no law providing for a minimum age of conversion. In 2016, a bill was introduced in the Sindh Assembly stipulating 18 years as the minimum age for such a profound, life-changing decision.

But when the religious lobby created a furore, the PPP government shamefully capitulated and the law was never enacted, leaving this critical issue concerning the minorities’ fundamental rights far from settled, and dependent on a case-by-case interpretation.

Almost always thus far, despite the law on underage marriage, the courts have been inclined to look the other way if the girl claims her conversion was according to her will, and allowed her to go with her purported spouse. The inequality of social and political power between the two parties is an important factor in this pattern, as is the pressure exerted in an atmosphere of growing religiosity, where true free will in matters of faith scarcely exists.

2018,1031,1548,https://www.dawn.com/news/1539162/boy-recovered-alive-from-building-debris,3/8/20 7:09,Boy recovered alive from building debris,"KARACHI: A boy was pulled out alive on Saturday with two bodies from the rubble of the buildings that had collapsed in Gulbahar on Thursday. The death toll from the tragedy thus rose to 19 with suspicions that some other people might also be trapped under the rubble.

The boy stated to be 13 to 14 years old, could not be identified.

The two bodies recovered from the debris of the collapsed buildings in the evening were identified as that of Tariq Ali, 24, and Amir Ali, 55. They were taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities.

Meanwhile, a preliminary probe suggested that the owner-cum-builder carried out excavation at the foundation of the ground-plus-four storey building to erect additional pillars to strengthen the structure before the building collapsed and fell on three adjoining multistorey buildings.

The owner carried out this activity when the building developed cracks during the construction of its upper floor, police said.

Rizvia Society police station investigation officer (SIO) Agha Amir told Dawn that the owner, Mohammed Javed Khan, had started construction work on a fifth floor when the building cracked.

The builder allegedly carried out major excavation work at the foundation and tried to erect additional pillars to support the existing pillars to strengthen the building structure.

The builder, who has been nominated in the FIR on charges of manslaughter etc, was apparently doing this to prevent the building from collapsing.

Besides, according to the police, since the area was facing a water shortage, most of the construction work was being carried out with the help of subsoil water that was also being used for domestic consumption.

The officer said that this practice of extracting underground water was also leading to land subsidence, thus the structure of the buildings was stated to have been weakened. However, the officer said this was only their preliminary probe into the incident.

He suggested that it was up to the engineers and experts concerned to ascertain the exact cause of the collapse of the multistorey building.

The rescue institutions continued removing the debris from the place on the third consecutive day on Saturday when the boy was rescued alive. The police officer said that the youngster was rescued alive during the removal of the debris.

The police feared that some more people might be trapped under the rubble, but added that their relatives had not approached the police on the matter.

On Thursday and Friday, the debris was removed manually to save lives.

However, on Saturday, heavy machinery was used. All shops and roads leading to the place have been cleared as area people cooperated with the authorities in using heavy machinery for the removal of rubble.

Police surgeon Dr Qarar Ahmed Abbasi said that all but one injured persons had been discharged after first aid from the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital. He added that an unknown injured man, in his 20s, had been admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital as his condition was serious.

2027,1040,1564,https://www.dawn.com/news/1542082,3/19/20 7:19,Preventing abuse,"CHILD abuse and neglect include both commission of physical, sexual and psychological abuse and omission in failing to provide emotional, educational needs and protection from harm. Too often, incidents of child abuse surface, leading to public outcry and arrests of perpetrators, and then everybody retreats to their corner.

The recently passed Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Act (ZARRA) is perhaps the first instance by the state of truly recognising the severity and urgency of this issue. All the same, three nagging questions remain: (i) what are the main causes of such incidents recurring; (ii) can ZARRA adequately prevent such incidents; (iii) what simultaneous steps can state and society take to create a safe, stable and nurturing environment for children?

First, it must be understood that child abuse cases are significantly unreported, especially those of minor girls, owing to the social stigma attached to being a victim. Despite being a flashpoint for child abuse in the news, in Kasur district, for example, only 79 cases of child abuse (including rape and sodomy of minors) involving 94 accused persons were lodged in 2019. Fifty-nine cases of attempted rape and sodomy cases involving 62 accused persons were also lodged.

Second, perpetrators of these heinous crimes are often themselves victims of abuse during childhood. During police investigation, the accused in the Zainab and Chunian rape-murder cases both revealed that they were raped as children. When a child is abused at such an early age, it can leave indelible marks on their psyche.

The Zainab alert law is a positive step, albeit with some flaws.

Third, in almost all these cases, predators find easy targets among poor victims; the more in need, the easier it is to entice them with paltry sums of money or other gifts. Even Zainab was lured away in such a manner.

And fourth, barring the occasional media frenzy, our society is generally apathetic and desensitised towards the issue of child abuse. Perpetrators are viewed simply as psychopathic or monstrous outliers instead of people hidden in plain sight.

The recently passed ZARRA is an encouraging step. The act is a much-needed attempt to chalk out an institutional response. It is holistic and integrated in the sense that it involves more than one department in the recovery of missing and abducted children. On the response level, it constitutes a dedicated agency with an early warning system — helpline 1099 — to report cases. Convicted offenders will now be sentenced to at least 10 years behind bars, up to a maximum of life imprisonment. But still its approach is reactionary and severe. There are few areas that need further improvement.

First, ZARRA altogether fails to address child abuse prevention. Incarceration alone cannot act as an effective deterrent in the absence of an overarching and efficient preventive mechanism, which has been ignored. Second, rehabilitation of victims after their release from hostile custody is an area that also needs attention.

Then, the law envisages an alert system along the lines of the US Amber Alert, which was named after a nine-year-old girl who was abducted and subsequently killed in Texas in 1996. The alert system has yielded a significant number of recoveries of lost children in the US. However, replicating the same model in Pakistan doesn’t necessarily guarantee the same results. In fact, the dynamics of our society are different.

The alert system works well in urban societies with an extensively integrated service structure. If ZARRA is instantaneously circulated to the general public as outlined in Article 5(a) of the act, it will create more panic and insecurity, and in the bargain be of little help, if at all. Information concerning the descriptions of missing children should be shared among concerned quarters only — related government departments, intelligence agencies and the population of a specific area.

In order to forestall incidents of child abuse, state and society should collectively step up efforts. At a societal level, it starts primarily with positive parenting in a family where children are provided care and nurtured at home. They are taught the difference between appropriate and inappropriate exposure and contact. They are closely monitored in the company of non-immediate relatives, family friends and in seminaries.

At a state level, a more aggressive and thoughtful response is needed; local police must devise a surveillance mechanism to check the activities of desperate, unemployed, notorious elements in society, especially those involved in child abuse incidents in the past, as well as places like internet cafés, snooker clubs, mechanic workshops and ill-reputed seminaries.

To protect its citizens from any assault is the fundamental duty of the state. A state cannot afford ignorance, nor can it allow its citizens’ lives to be ruined by predators.

2046,1059,1587,https://www.dawn.com/news/1590001,11/12/20 16:02,"Rape of woman, minor daughter in Sindh's Kashmore causes outrage","A man was arrested for allegedly subjecting a woman and her minor daughter to rape for two days after duping the former with a job offer in northern Sindh's Kashmore district, police said on Thursday.

Police arrested the suspect using a trap while an accomplice is currently at large.

Kashmore Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Amjad Ali Shaikh confirmed the suspect's arrest. He said the woman and her daughter were medically examined and their samples were now being sent for forensic and DNA examinations.

Both the victims hail from Karachi, according to Kashmore police. The woman had come across the suspect at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) in Karachi nearly a week ago. The suspect ""promised the woman that he would get her a job at Kashmore Toll Plaza and she readily agreed,” a policeman said.

The woman arrived in Kashmore over the past weekend and met the suspect. Two days later, she approached Kashmore police, alleging that the suspect had raped her after she reached his residence, and he then handed her over to another man living near the Sindh-Balochistan border. That man also allegedly raped the woman, according to SSP Shaikh.

The woman told police that the suspect held her five-year-old daughter hostage, saying he would only let her go when she brought him another woman from Karachi. According to police, the suspect also gave her some money to cover her travelling expenses.

Kashmore police then devised a ploy to nab the suspect.

“Our ASI (assistant sub-inspector) Mohammad Bux Buriro persuaded his wife to talk to the suspect over phone which she did. Then the woman from Karachi and the ASI’s daughter waited in a park in Kashmore where the suspect was scheduled to meet them,” said Kashmore Station House Officer (SHO) Akbar Channa.

As soon as the suspect arrived there, police apprehended him, according to the SSP. He then led police to a cattle pen where he had kept the young girl. “The girl told police that he had subjected her to criminal assault,” the police officer said.

He explained that the trap was arranged and police needed a woman for this purpose so the suspect would be tricked into thinking the victim had brought another woman as he had desired. “Otherwise it would have been difficult to lay hands on him,” he said.

Police conducted raids for the arrest of the other man in Balochistan but he remained at large. A local court has already remanded the Kashmore suspect in police custody for three days.

A case was registered against the two men on Tuesday on the complaint of Kashmore police under under Sections 376 (punishment of rape), 344 (wrongful confinement for ten or more days), 420 (cheating) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code. Besides the two suspects, one unidentified person was also nominated in the case by police.

SHO Channa said the samples of the woman and her daughter were being sent for DNA and forensic analysis.

The DNA samples and clothes will be examined at the Forensic and Molecular Sciences laboratory of the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences in Jamshoro.

'Bestial mindset'

The latest incident involving sexual violence against women and children sparked outrage on social media and was condemned by rights activists and politicians as well. It remained one of the top trends on Twitter in Pakistan and was being posted about with the hashtag 'Kashmore tragedy'.

Comments on Facebook eulogised ASI Buriro for involving his daughter in order to trap the suspect in the case. His photo was also shared on social media to acknowledge his effort.

The minor girl and her mother have been shifted to Larkana, the divisional headquarters in upper Sindh. Larkana district has a tertiary hospital as well where the girl might be kept for treatment, officials said.

PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari issued a statement saying he had taken strong notice of ""the brutal incident"", which had ""shocked him personally and the beasts involved in this gruesome crime have shamed humanity"".

Bilawal said the victims will get justice at any cost and asked the Sindh government to ensure that the culprits get exemplary punishment under the law. He also asked the government to ensure adequate medical treatment for both the victims.

Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari said the ""horrific Kashmore rape case shows how despite laws a bestial mindset continues to ravage our society, violating our children. [...] Sindh government must ensure strict enforcement of law.""

Sindh Governor Imran Ismail termed the incident ""sickening"". He said he was following the case ""to ensure strictest punishment for the criminals"" and the best medical treatment and post-trauma care for the child.

Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari said the ""horrific Kashmore rape case shows how despite laws a bestial mindset continues to ravage our society, violating our children.","['sindhs', 'minor', 'medical', 'outrage', 'man', 'causes', 'karachi', 'woman', 'girl', 'suspect', 'case', 'rape', 'kashmore', 'daughter']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/09/5f66b14cdf5da.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/11/5fad05d02ff70.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/11/5fad05d02ff70.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/02/5c6918932fa98.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/09/5f66b14cdf5da.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd309b711467.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/09/5f62276a377a5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/02/5c6918932fa98.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/09/5f62276a377a5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd306ee076b9.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/11/5fad05d02ff70.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Police arrest the main suspect using a trap while an accomplice of his is currently at large.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1590001', 'type': 'article', 'title': ""Rape of woman, minor daughter in Sindh's Kashmore causes outrage"", 'description': 'Police arrest the main suspect using a trap while an accomplice of his is currently at large.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/11/5fad05d02ff70.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1590001', 'title': ""Rape of woman, minor daughter in Sindh's Kashmore causes outrage"", 'description': 'Police arrest the main suspect using a trap while an accomplice of his is currently at large.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/11/5fad05d02ff70.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-11-12 16:02:02', 'modified_time': '2020-11-12 17:49:12', 'tag': 'Violence against children', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/354/mohammad-hussain-khan'}, 'keywords': 'Violence against women,Violence against children', 'news_keywords': 'Violence against women,Violence against children', 'author': 'Mohammad Hussain Khan'})",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dawn,,2020-11-12
2074,1087,1622,https://www.dawn.com/news/1538537,3/5/20 7:03,On harassment,"IN recent years, ‘harassment’ has become an integral part of our popular vocabulary. It is now discussed in mainstream media — albeit often not with the nuance and sensitivity it deserves — and fiercely debated in both private and public spaces. It is hard to imagine that, unlike other types of sexual and gender-based violence, harassment is a relatively new concept, both as a legal category and in the public imagination.

Developed as a legal concept in the 1970s by scholar Catherine MacKinnon, harassment was conceived as a form of sexual discrimination. Laws on harassment were a triumph of second-wave feminism and its engagement with legal instruments as it reifies social inequalities and forces the law to acknowledge societal power structures.

While all subjects are equal under the eyes of the law, progressive laws such as those on harassment force the neutral language of the law to acknowledge that society is, in fact, unequal and this understanding needs to be taken into account. Workplace harassment, for instance, acknowledges that workplaces are unequal and hierarchal, thus the ability of those in positions of power to harass, intimidate and silence subordinates is quite likely. This, coupled with the oppressions and structures of subordination inherent in patriarchal societies, makes women more vulnerable to harassment.

It felt like a dam had burst.

In Pakistan, the movement behind the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, is an example of successful advocacy. The Alliance Against Sexual Harassment brought together women from all walks of life, and male allies, to work on the issue of workplace harassment. It is one of several gains made by the Pakistani feminist movement and its engagement with the law. The act makes it mandatory to have inquiry committees in each workplace and ombudspersons at the provincial and federal level.

Recently, however, the efficacy of the law has been called into question. While it has become a cliché to trace a shift from the #MeToo moment, it is not inaccurate to say that the issue of harassment exploded in the public consciousness in the past three years. Testimonies of women across the world, including Pakistan, were thrust into the public discourse. It felt like a dam had burst. Suddenly, our newsfeeds were littered with the trauma of women who had been violated and silenced.

While the #MeToo era has made leaps and bounds in terms of public awareness, the movement has been noticeably absent in its engagement with the law and its accompanying justice system. Many young feminists are either disillusioned with the law or view it as an obstacle rather than a tool for engagement. In the process of this disengagement, the inadequacies of the law have been laid bare.

Glaringly, the law on workplace harassment takes a very narrow approach to defining gender, sticking to binaries of men and women to the exclusion of trans individuals whose bodies are often the site of this very violence. Additionally, the provision in the Pakistan Penal Code on Harassment (Section 509) only applies to women. These gender binaries reified in the law can lead to structural exclusions for those not given legal recognition, rendering the violence they experience as invisible.

Secondly, feminist approaches to legal theory posit that laws need to take into account the lived experience of marginalised communities, and thus any law that places the burden of proof on women to prove their harassment ignores the realities of the discrimination or violence they experience. It is extremely difficult to provide cogent evidence in these cases because harassment often rarely leaves behind a neat paper trail and usually takes place when the victim is most vulnerable and isolated.

This question of standards of evidence often takes place in frantic tones and hyperbolic warnings, where weary men warn of floodgates of false testimonies as if women are lining up to pursue false cases in a system that already marginalises them. In fact, we need to have important discussions that dismantle the patriarchal legal constructs such as the ‘reasonable man standard’. Judges and lawyers need to develop precedents that place the lived experience of women at the centre and speak to the ‘reasonable woman standard’ that incorporates the positionality of women, and the intersectionalities that define their lives, when adjudicating a case.

As women across Pakistan take to the streets this Sunday to mark International Working Women’s Day, it is important to listen to experiences of the women who are marching — each of them carrying a placard that has a story of harassment. The demands of the various Aurat Marches include safer workplaces and public spaces, where harassment is not merely an inevitability. Join them on March 8. Imagine what a safer, more just and equitable society could look like, one in which all of us are free from discrimination and violence.

2076,1089,1624,https://www.dawn.com/news/1526751,1/7/20 7:05,"PM wants massive drive against drugs, child abuse","PRIME Minister Imran Khan addresses the launching ceremony of Zindagi App on Monday.—PPI

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday urged the provinces and other stakeholders to combat the menace of drugs and child abuse by launching a massive countrywide campaign against them to protect the youth.

“Drug addiction among school going children and child abuse are two big issues confronting our society which need to be addressed through collaborated efforts of the government, provinces, Anti-Narcotic Force, police and teachers,” the prime minister said while launching a mobile application called “Zindagi” (life) which can be used for lodging complaints against drug abuse and creating awareness among parents and teachers about how to protect children from the menace.

“Our mosques and ulema should also play their role in eradicating these menaces. Ulema can create awareness among people about the growing use of drugs in educational institutions in their Friday sermons,” he added.

The prime minister said he had got separate briefings from inspectors general of police (IGs) of Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and was shocked to know that a new synthetic drug called “ice” was being used by the pupils of expensive and high-profile schools as they were more vulnerable to the drug. “Once they [schoolchildren] use ice they fall prey to other drugs as well. There was a time when we heard there were drugs in universities. Now drugs are present in schools,” he added.

Launches mobile app to protect youth from the menace, meets Virginia University students

Prime Minister Khan said powerful mafias were behind unbridled drug abuse in the country and they always kept themselves safe from any action of the police and drug controlling authorities because of their money. “On my directives a raid was conducted by the police in KP but the drug pushers had fled before the raid because someone in the police had already informed them about the police action.”

He regretted that Pakistan was among top countries where child pornography was on the higher side. “People don’t like to talk about this issue due to shame but our government raised it as a national issue because it is an epidemic. In both these matters [child and drug abuses], mobile phones have aggravated the situation. We have decided to combat both these issues on an emergency basis,” he added.

However, the prime minister stressed that controlling the two menaces could not be the responsibility of only the police or any single department, but the whole nation should be united to combat these issues.

He said the Zindagi App was an effort to raise awareness among the parents and teachers about the danger of drug abuse and how to tackle it.

The app features a complete collection of drug awareness, drug prevention and treatment, rehabs locations, success stories and supportive community to help and meditate drug victims. It can be downloaded from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

On the occasion, a book aimed at creating awareness about drugs was also launched. Prime Minister Khan emphasised the need for introducing the book in all schools to increase knowledge and awareness about the issue.

Students meet PM

Prime Minister Imran Khan said the present government was striving to introduce a uniform curriculum in the country so as to eliminate current education-based discrimination in society. He said promotion of human resource and development was a big challenge in the presence of three different education systems.

He was talking to a delegation of students from Business Administration Department of Virginia University, who were currently on a visit to Pakistan to have first-hand information about the potential of business and tourism in the country.

During the interactive meeting, matters relating to challenges faced by the country, reforms agenda of the present government, positive aspects of Pakistani society, existing potential of the country in diverse sectors, economic challenges and future strategy were discussed.

Prime Minister Khan said Pakistan was bestowed by Allah Almighty with abundant resources, but unfortunately development process in the country got stagnant due to corruption and neglect of human resource promotion by the previous governments. “Pakistan was the fastest developing country in South Asia in the decade of 1960s, but the political philosophies of the decades of 1970s and 1980s not only led to blocking of industrial development but also inclusion of money and corruption in politics,” he added.

Mr Khan said he was fighting against what he called “mafia” which had been creating hurdles in the way of country’s progress, adding that the challenge before him was not only the elimination of corruption but also improving the education system. He said the present government believed in the protection of minorities’ rights and deemed them equal citizens. “Our religion Islam and the teachings of the Father of Nation give us the lesson of protecting minorities’ rights.”

About current regional situation, the prime minister said the Indian government’s policies based on the philosophy of RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) posed serious threats to the regional peace. “Oppressive policies of the Indian government have endangered the identity of Indians themselves and identity and existence of 500 million minorities living in India,” he said.

2093,1106,1645,https://www.dawn.com/news/1527519,1/11/20 7:11,"Celebrities join hands against child abuse, urge govt to implement laws","KARACHI: A number of celebrities, some in attendance while others sharing their thoughts via recorded video messages, extended their support to the campaign against child abuse at a presser organised at the press club on Friday where they called upon the government to implement all relevant laws related to children’s rights.

They also urged the government to appoint trained staff at hospitals to handle cases of child abuse, establish separate reporting desks for child abuse cases at police stations and make changes in the school curriculum to help children understand and report abuse.

The press conference was organised to launch a film campaign on child abuse by Angeline Malik, the producer and director of the venture.

“A few years ago, the numbers of child abuse cases were only a matter of stats for me until I went to Kasur and met a victim of child sexual abuse,” Malik said, explaining what motivated her to launch the campaign.

Sharing the victim’s psychological trauma, she said the girl had developed strong fears and screamed whenever a door slammed in the home or she heard her mother’s voice.

“No child should go through what she experienced. That’s why I launched this campaign so that our voices are heard,” Malik said, while appreciating the support of her colleagues and Sahil, a non-profit organisation working for child protection.

Referring to the Zainab Alert Bill passed by the National Assembly two years after the Kasur killings, she said that while that’s good news, the important thing was to see the law being implemented in letter and spirit.

Continuing on the same point, she cited Pakistan’s ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990 and said the country still lagged far behind in its implementation.

To a question, she said it’s the first film on the subject and more would follow on the same theme to create awareness and raise a collective voice against the heinous crime.

Samina Ahmed said child abuse was a grave crime and its growing incidents should be a matter of concern for everyone.

“Ideally, children should be raised in a healthy and secure environment. To me, making children understand about good and bad touch is like snatching part of their childhood [but unfortunately we need to do this as we don’t live in a perfect environment],” she observed.

On the Zainab Alert Bill, she said apparently its jurisdiction was restricted to the federal capital and the respective provincial governments needed to do their legislation on this subject.

Faraz Khan, a member of the advisory board of Muhafiz, a digital app for reporting threat/s to support groups and institutions including the law enforcement agencies, underscored the need for changing societal mindset and making institutions law-abiding bodies.

Sharing her sentiments, Bushra Ansari demanded brutal punishment for perpetrators of child abuse and said they should be subjected to the same pain, torture and injuries that they inflicted upon their victims.

“[The] death penalty is not enough for offenders of such heinous crimes as this punishment inflicts pain for a moment. Such offenders should be subjected to horrifying, brutal death so others don’t dare indulge in such inhumane acts,” she said, while asking government to direct educational institutions, including the religious ones, to install cameras at their premises.

Ansari was of the opinion that the matter of child abuse was interlinked with many social issues including growing population and there was a need to make people understand the importance of and practice family planning.

Zeba Bakhtiar said child abuse was a complicated matter and, unlike common perception that it had more to do with the lower-income households, it was prevalent in all sections of society and needed an in-depth psychological approach to understand the reasons behind it and come up with the right solutions.

Among those who had recorded their messages were Ushna Shah, Hina Bayat, Saman Ansari, Ahmed Ali Butt, Alyy Khan, Sarwat Gillani, Samiya Mumtaz, Rasikh Ismail, Salma Hasan, Suzain Fatima and Nida Yasir.

2102,1115,1658,https://images.dawn.com/news/1185600,8/4/20 12:15,Ayesha Omar opens up about being a sexual assault survivor to Rose McGowan,"In light of the #MeToo movement that grew in strength after women started coming out with their stories, actor and director Rose McGowan opened up about her struggle in 2017, 20 years after she was assaulted by Harvey Weinstein, the now disgraced American producer.

In a live Instagram conversation with Ayesha Omar, McGowan revealed how she gathered the strength to finally speak about what had happened to her.

A photo posted by Instagram (@instagram) on Mar 22, 2015 at 11:21am PDT

""I always had a voice, just no one was listening,"" she Rose. ""I was waiting for society to be ready. I needed Trump. Hilary Clinton protected Weinstein in a major way. I needed Trump to show people this is racism, sexism, and this is what ugliness really looks like.""

As a survivor standing against the world, she also opened up about going through the ordeal alone.

""I didn't have friends. No women's groups to help me, nothing.""

However, she was confident that the harasser was the only one to blame.

""It was never my shame,"" Rose said, as she often waited for someone she could meet one day, who would make a difference in the way things were happening. ""And then I thought, nope, it's gonna be me.""

Omar also added how being in Pakistani society, fear and shame are two dominant emotions for women in such circumstances. ""We are not allowed to be angry,"" said the Bulbulay actress.

The duo then together discussed how the blame of assault is usually shifted on women. Sometimes through clothing, and other times because they are just ""asking for it"".

""#MeToo triggered people all over the world; it's a communication tool, it's there to say, I know your pain,"" said McGowan. Soon after, Ayesha too, shared the story of her own assault.

""A huge powerful man, twice my age. I had just entered the industry, I was this young 23-year-old, fresh out of college, and bam, this started happening. And it went on for years,"" she shared.

""It wasn't a one-off incident, and I just didn't want to process it. I put in a box, and I said okay, this is happening in my life, I have to deal with it. I didn't wanna share it with anybody. I let it stay there for 15 years, and I finally spoke about it to someone two years ago.""

""A friend of mine from the industry also came out with her story, and TV channels started calling me up and asking 'Do you think she's telling the truth?'"" Ayesha told Rose.

""And I said 'I would believe any victim'. They asked me if sexual harassment happens in the industry and that's the first time I said yes. They asked if it happened to you, and I said yes. I will talk about it someday, but not today. I still haven't named my monster but I've started talking about it,"" Omar said.

Rose also mentioned how her own activism too started way before the Weinstein incident.

""I'm really about men and women to see each other as human, and not through gender,"" she concluded.","['Images Staff', 'Desk Report', 'A Huge Powerful Man', 'Twice My Age', 'When I Had Just Entered The Industry At And It Went On For Years', 'Shared Ayesha', 'Indie Guy', 'M.

The woman was travelling from Lahore to Gujranwala along with her children.

A police official stated that as the woman crossed the toll plaza on the Lahore-Sialkot motorway, her car stalled either due to shortage of petrol or some fault.

Meanwhile, she got a call from a relative of Gujranwala, who asked her to call the police helpline for help while he also left from home to reach her.

When he reached the location, he found the woman terrified with her clothes stained with blood.

The police official stated that two armed men found the woman alone, took her and her children to a nearby field at gunpoint and gang-raped her.

He said the police had formed teams to trace the culprits.

He said the woman had yet to call the helpline when the armed men reached there. They also took away cash, jewellery and other valuables from her.

The woman is said to be a resident of the Defence Housing Authority and her husband worked abroad, the police officer said, adding a case had been registered against the two unidentified robbers on the complaint of her relative.

2139,1152,11,https://www.dawn.com/news/1560352,5/30/20 6:50,Police performance,"POLICE performance, not just in Pakistan but across the world, is rightly scrutinised by the public and other relevant stakeholders. The recent steps being taken by the inspector general, Punjab Police, reflect a new mechanism to assess field officers’ performance as reported by this paper on April 29. Any steps to improve performance must be lauded but the evaluation regime recently introduced appears to be an innovation to tackle a complex issue. Performance will be used to decide future postings etc of senior officers through awarding positive and negative points. Whilst at first sight, and in principle, this seems appropriate, there is a fundamental problem with using such a narrow set of metrics and over such a short period. Crime is rarely impacted so quickly by police actions.

The debate, even arguments, about what and how performance should be assessed is an ongoing one. For example, should it be about attaching priority to assessing property crimes, eg vehicle, residential and commercial property crime, or crimes against the person, eg murder/attempted murder, kidnapping, sexual assault, or white collar crime, or a combination of offences? Who should decide? What criteria should be used? Further, there needs to be a delineation between assessment of an individual district/city police officer’s personal performance and the overall performance of their district or city.

Meaningful and effective performance management should have its focus on outcomes.

In order to tackle crime effectively, there should be an effective response to reported crime but also proactive actions by police to investigate crimes that are occurring but are usually not reported, eg drug trafficking and money laundering. The latter usually lie in the domain of organised crime syndicates. In order to paint a picture and understand what is going on with organised crime there has to be good intelligence available. This requires proper structures, information security, analysis and then action. In essence, police action is much more effective when you tackle the criminal rather than the crime as criminals are extremely adaptive. They look at opportunities to make money and are not too bound by crime types but rather view them as commodities. For example, crime syndicates will collaborate where it is in their interest to do so — they may ordinarily be competitors but under certain circumstances, collaboration serves their mutual interest.

Further, if individual officers are to be held accountable they need to be given the tools and freedom to adapt policing in their areas under a corporate framework set by the IGP from the central police office. This can only be done if there is security of tenure for officers from top to bottom. That is not to say poor performance is tolerated through security of tenure but rather interventions are put in place to support and challenge the district police to improve their performance. Ultimately poor performance has to have sanctions but these need to be set out at the outset in the interest of transparency.

There is temptation to focus on performance that is easy to measure, eg the number of stolen vehicles. Just as important are qualitative measures, eg data needs to be collected about both the public’s perception and the reality of interactions with police. A district with a good detection rate for acquisitive crime might be totally failing in its interactions with the public. So how is this reflected in performance assessment?

Meaningful and effective performance management should have its focus on outcomes and not simply be a measure of police activity. Two examples illustrate this point: One, the simplistic metric around the submission of DNA samples could provide perverse incentives without adding any value to police performance. If samples are taken where they will not add value to the investigation they will simply be a waste of resources, but, superficially, a district’s performance will look good because samples would have been submitted in a higher proportion of cases. Instead, the measures should be about positive outcomes achieved from the submission of samples.

Two, the number of challans submitted is, rightly, an important measure but what is the quality of the evidence on which the indictment is based? Police themselves decide when there is sufficient evidence to submit a challan but there is no independent evaluation of that evidence to determine whether the case justifies a trial. This can lead to police performance looking more positive than it really is if cases going to court are weak and therefore not able to be successfully prosecuted. One only has to look at verdicts from the higher courts where cases from the lower courts have been appealed to find that the conviction was based on weak, sometimes flimsy evidence. This state of affairs serves the interests of neither the victims nor the defendants nor criminal justice as a whole.

It is also important to look at the ‘health’ of the organisation itself, ie the number of complaints against police officers in the district, especially police stations — officers suspended and awarded minor or major punishments. Moreover, public perception survey data needs to be collected regarding the performance of officers themselves and their organisation. This can be done at various levels.

All this is not something that can be done overnight as it needs resources, and a change in culture and structures. The IGP Punjab has taken important first steps but if meaningful performance management is to become part of how the Punjab Police (or others) do business then a lot more changes are required. These changes will not be easy and can only be delivered if the majority of the organisation, at least, buys into delivering that change. For that to happen, staff across all ranks need to be remunerated properly and have terms and conditions of service that deal with their well-being. Above all, they must have self-esteem. The latter will only happen if they are treated with dignity both by their own organisation and the public at large.

This is a tall order but would anyone of us accept anything less for ourselves?

According to the FIR registered at Airport Police Station by the victim's sister, the incident occurred on June 29.

In the complaint, she stated that the suspect, identified as Ali Salman Alvi, called her from her sister's phone at 2pm saying that he was ""ruined"" and the victim, identified as Sadaf Zahra, had ""done something"", before hanging up.

She rushed to their home, along with her husband and mother, where they found the suspect standing at the main door while the rest of the doors had been locked from the inside, the FIR said.

She added that the suspect then led them to their room where they found Zahra's body hanging from the ceiling fan by a bed sheet tied around her neck and a ladder lying close by.

The victim's sister alleged that the suspect had beaten her sister on multiple occasions, despite being warned repeatedly. She urged the police to investigate the incident.

Speaking to Dawn.com, Airport Police Station SHO Jawad Shah said the accused was arrested under Section 302 (murder or Qatl-i-Amd) of the Pakistan Penal Code the same day the incident occurred. He added that the accused was currently in police custody on physical remand.

He said that the deceased's autopsy report was still awaited, after which it will be concluded whether she was a victim of domestic violence.

The incident was highlighted on social media on Wednesday as citizens demanded justice for the victim, who had previously spoken up about domestic violence on Twitter.

Replying to the victim's Twitter thread, Digital Rights Foundation Director Nighat Dad said that the victim ""who did an entire thread on domestic violence was a victim of domestic abuse herself"".

Lawyer Khadija Siddiqui urged the authorities concerned to ensure the suspect was brought to justice.

Meanwhile, journalist Asma Shirazi said she was was ""shocked and numbed"" the moment she got to know about the incident. She added that the media group she was working with strictly condemned the incident and had terminated the accused.

Earlier today, Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari said that a bill for domestic violence will be tabled in the National Assembly today (Wednesday).

In a tweet, she said: ""The Domestic Violence (Protection and Prevention) Bill 2020 prepared by [human rights ministry] and approved by CCLC and cabinet will be tabled today in NA.""","['Tahir Naseer', 'Surendra Sukhtankar', 'Asif', 'A.

Police said that initial investigation reports suggested that the police constable, who was posted at CTD Civil Lines, shot and injured Dr Fahad Hussain in the emergency ward of the hospital over not getting sleeping pills the previous night by another doctor who had advised him not to take such drugs.

CTD senior official Raja Umer Khattab said that the police constable had been suffering from chest pains for the last 15-20 days. He got tested at Ziauddin Hospital and was diagnosed with typhoid. He visited the NICVD on Tuesday night where the security guard prevented him from entering and asked him to wear a mask first.

After an argument with the guard, the police constable managed to get a mask from someone and entered the emergency ward where he reportedly asked the doctor for sleeping pills as he hadn't slept for three days. Khattab said that the doctor did not give him the medicines upon which the constable went back home.

He returned to the hospital on Wednesday night and asked about the same doctor. The official said that when the police constable found out that doctor was not available, he opened fire on another doctor (Fahad) and managed to escape. Khattab said that after the incident, the suspect visited CTD Civil Lines where he behaved strangely and told his colleagues that he had shot the doctor.

Khattab said he asked police personnel to detain him, adding that the CTD police later handed him over to Saddar police for the investigation. Quoting the suspect's family and colleagues, the CTD official said he believed that lately the detained policeman had become “emotionally disturbed”.

Dr Fahad suffered two bullet wounds in his legs and his condition was said to be out of danger. The police have registered a first information report (FIR) against the police constable under section 324 (attempt to commit qatl-i-amd) of the Pakistan Penal Code on complaint of the wounded doctor.

The complainant in his statement to the police said that he was performing his duty in the emergency ward when a man came and asked him as to whether the doctor from the previous night was there. Fahad said that he told him he didn't know about the doctor's whereabouts upon which the suspect started alleging that “you (doctors) are dishonest and I will not spare you” and shot at both his legs before fleeing.","['Imtiaz Ali', 'Gm Bughio', 'Dr. Salaria', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Mustafa Tai', 'Justice First', 'Chrís Dăń', 'Dr Tarik', 'Tiddi Raja', 'Azam']","A policeman shot and injured a doctor at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) in Karachi late on Wednesday night allegedly over not being prescribed sleeping pills.

2149,1162,56,https://www.dawn.com/news/1563542,6/15/20 6:42,Violence grips US again as police kill another black man,"WASHINGTON: “We are done dying,” declared the National Associ­ation for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) as violence re-erupted across America on Sunday over death of yet another African-American man, this time by police shooting.

Rayshard Brooks, 27, was shot dead by police on Friday night outside a Wendy’s outlet in Atlanta, Georgia, after he was found sleeping in the restaurant’s drive-through area.

“We do not have the full right to live in this country,” said NAACP, one of the largest civil rights groups in America, while urging people to join its campaign against racism. “Business as usual may cost us our livelihoods and our lives.”

Civil rights activists are trying to change social attitudes in America, particularly towards the African-American community. The movement gained momentum late last month when a policeman choked George Floyd to death in Minneapolis as dozens watched and filmed the incident.

The police cruelty stunned the American nation, causing countrywide protests that were the most intense in Minneapolis and in the nation’s capital, Washington. Tens of thousands of whites joined the protest, although Floyd was an African-American.

But appeals for peace, and the fear of a resurgence of Covid-19, eased the tensions until this weekend when Brooks’ death re-ignited the fire. The backlash started with a video that showed Brooks resisting arrest and then running away from two police officers after snatching a taser.

One of the officers chased Brooks and fired several shots into him after he turned the device, which is used to stun a detainee, towards the officer.

A crowd gathered outside the restaurant on Saturday and set it on fire, as an estimated 1,000 protesters watched it burning. Protesters then walked to a nearby highway, stopping traffic.

They locked arms, chanting “black lives matter” and “I can’t breathe,” slogans popularised during the protest against Floyd’s killing.

“I can’t breathe,” were Floyd’s last words and of another African-American, Eric Garner, who died in police custody in Staten Island, New York, in July 2014. He repeated the words 11 times before he died.

These words have now become an international rallying cry against racism as people across the globe continue to express solidarity with the protesters in the United States.

In Atlanta, police made several attempts to disperse the crowd and made dozens of arrests, but the demonstrations continued till Sunday morning. A small group emerged later and set the Wendy’s on fire again. Others spread out to various neighbourhoods.

As the unrest continued, the Atlanta Police Department fired officer Garrett Rolfe, who shot Brooks, and placed his partner, Devin Bronsan, on administrative duty.

Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced that police chief Erika Shields had also resigned. “I do not believe that this was a justified use of deadly force,” she said.

The provincial government developed the PWDP 2018 to systematically eradicate all manifestations of explicit and implicit gender discrimination across all spheres of society and address the whole range of women development concerns and challenges in line with the spirit of the Constitution, Pakistan’s international commitments and priorities of the provincial government to pursue the goal of gender mainstreaming and women empowerment in Punjab.

The policy has seven key sectoral strategies, namely Women Political Empowerment and Rights Based Governance; Women and Education/Skills Development, Women and Health; Women Poverty Reduction and Economic Empowerment; Gender Based Violence; Women and Climate Change and last but not the least Women and ICT.

The implementation framework provides a set of activities, their monitoring and evaluation plan keeping within these strategic areas. The framework was finalised after a long process of individual and group consultations and validation workshops, repeatedly engaging with all 36 departments.

Minister Women Development Ashifa Riaz Fatyana, in her keynote address expressed her optimism that the framework will play a key role in changing realities in women’s favour in the province. She added that poor implementation is often the cause for lack of success of any policy. This document spells out roles and responsibilities and provides one platform to all departments in Punjab for measuring success and chalking a way forward.

Bilal Colony SHO Fardad Shaikh said that gas was apparently left open in the home in Sector 5-D near Dua Chowk and owing to the leakage, the home was filled with gas. The officer said that the family were asleep at around 2.30am and when the owner woke up in the morning and lit a matchstick for smoking, it triggered an explosion. As a result, the house caught fire.

Seven persons suffered burn injuries and they were taken to a hospital, where one of them, identified as Mazhar Adil, 8, died.

The SHO said that the condition of two or three other persons was also stated to be critical. He said that all the victims belonged to the same family.

The injured were identified as Fasiur Rehman Adil, 7, Syeda Ghazi Adeel, 13, Syed Adil, 35, Nosheen Adil, 30, Saba Ateeq, 25, and Saif Ullah Adil, 12.

The police called the Bomb Disposal Squad to ascertain the nature of the explosion. The bomb experts in their report stated it was an incident caused by gas leakage. The police said that it was regular gas as no evidence of a cylinder explosion was found at the spot.

BDS official Abid Farooq told the media that it appeared that the gas leakage took place at night, with gas filling the house. He said the explosion caused substantive damage to the two-storey building.

2162,1175,118,https://www.dawn.com/news/1539208,3/8/20 7:05,Violence against women,"VIOLENCE against women in Pakistan is both a crime and a socially accepted norm. While we have laws that protect women from violence, the state has absolved itself of the responsibility to enforce these laws. This means that women have an inherently paradoxical relationship with the state: with one hand the state gives women rights in the form of constitutional guarantees, international treaty commitments and some progressive legislation; with the other it takes away these rights by refusing to implement these laws or take measures to create the conditions under which these rights can be realised.

Read: Violence against women persists despite legislation

The guarantee of formal equality and the obstinate refusal to grant substantive equality mirrors the behaviour of an abusive spouse who somehow convinces you that you need him even as he abuses you. When he suspects that you are about to leave him, he promises to change — and may even behave well for a few days, before going back to his old ways. Similarly, in response to daily reports of brutality against women and abysmal gender equality indicators, our state authorities will take certain measures periodically. There is widespread rhetoric about the integral role of women in the development of a nation; laws seeking to protect women are enacted; entire departments within the government are set up exclusively devoted to the development of women. When it comes to effectively protecting women against violence rooted in patriarchy, however, these same state authorities become either apathetic or complicit.

This is not to say that formal equality is insignificant. It is crucial in a context where social and cultural norms relegate women to subservient roles and render them highly vulnerable. It is valuable particularly in view of the fact that there was a time in Pakistan’s history when discrimination against women was official state policy. During Gen Ziaul Haq’s era, the state pursued an active agenda to preserve the subservient status of women. This period saw the enforcement of discriminatory policies and the imprisonment of women under Hudood laws.

Zia’s overt discrimination against women depended on conflating the suppression of women with tenets of Islam, and the portrayal of demands of gender equality as anti-religious. This insidious discourse continues to impede the movement for gender equality long after Zia is gone, and even after some of the pernicious laws passed under his time have been substantially chipped away. The association of equal citizenship of women with an ‘anti-Islam’ agenda continues to haunt the women’s movement. The fact that today the slogan ‘mera jism, meri marzi’ is deemed an insult to the religious and cultural values of the country is, in part, a result of Zia’s legacy.

The execution of these laws and policies belies the complete lack of interest of the state.

Thanks in large part to the women’s movement galvanised during Zia’s era, as well as a powerful global movement for women’s rights, subsequent governments have not pursued an overtly misogynistic state policy. Instead, the last few decades have seen a slew of policies and programmes aimed to prevent violence against women.

In 1995, Pakistan became a party to the Beijing Platform for Action, thereby committing to a range of policy measures to end all forms of discrimination against women. Some years later, the National Commission on the Status of Women was set up to monitor the state’s response to the progress of women. To respond to violence against women, the government proposed the establishment of women police stations. A number of initiatives to provide shelter and safe accommodation for women were rolled out — crisis centres, safe houses and working women hostels. Recent years have also seen the enactment of progressive laws to protect and punish violence against women, including laws prohibiting domestic violence and sexual harassment in the workplace.

The execution of these laws and policies, however, belies the complete lack of interest of the state to respond to violence against women. Neither budget nor personnel are allocated to enforce laws intended to protect women. There is impunity for law-enforcement authorities refusing to prevent and punish crimes against women. Institutions designed to address gender inequality, such as women development departments and women police stations, remain woefully de-prioritised.

The persistent gap between laws on paper and their practical implementation can be attributed to dysfunctional government. It should also be attributed to the resistance of the state to pose any real challenge to patriarchy. Violence against women is one of the most powerful tools of patriarchy and therefore effectively curbing violence will mean a big blow to one of the most important power structures of our society.

This begs the question: do policies and programmes exist to allow the state to portray an image of being ‘woman friendly’ while avoiding responsibility for taking truly effective measures? Are these measures really just smoke and mirrors, intended to deflect attention away from the unwillingness of the state to challenge patriarchy by taking effective measures to end violence against women?

Those struggling for the rights of women, however, are put in a difficult position as they cannot risk rejecting the superficial measures taken by the state or pretending that they do not exist. Even knowing that the state has no intention to implement laws and policies aimed to protect women, we must hold it to its promises no matter how insincere they may be. Effectively, the burden is again on women to motivate the state to enforce its laws, allocate funds toward protection mechanisms for women and ensure accountability for law enforcement and judicial officers who are derelict in their duties towards preventing and punishing violence against women.

Without a doubt, this is truly exhausting. Aurat March is an extremely powerful expression of the outrage at the apathy of the government towards pervasive discrimination. It is just as true now as it ever was that the state will not give women anything without a fight.

Bilawal's statement comes a day after a sessions court in Karachi granted post-arrest bail to three suspects detained for allegedly abducting Arzoo, who is said to have converted to Islam.

""GOS (Government of Sindh) will approach the courts to review the #ArzooRaja underage marriage case, clear up any misunderstanding the honourable court may have, and do everything in their power to provide justice,"" the PPP chairman said in a tweet.

He added that the PPP-led provincial government had passed the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act in 2013 and it will ""continue to fight for it to be implemented"".

The alleged abduction of 13-year-old Arzoo had sparked protests from human rights groups against her purported forced conversion and underage marriage with a Muslim man.

Police claimed to have booked her purported husband Syed Ali Azhar and detained his two brothers — Syed Shariq Ali and Syed Mohsin Ali — along with his friend Danish over their alleged involvement in Arzoo's abduction on October 13. All the three detained men were said to be police officials.

On Thursday, the three detained suspects moved applications before additional district and sessions judge (South) Faiza Khalil seeking grant of post-arrest bail to them.

Their defence counsel Hidayat Ali Leghari contended that an application was filed with the judicial magistrate concerned for recording Arzoo's statement under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). However, the same could not be done.

He further said that later the girl purportedly recorded her statement before the Sindh High Court, in which she stated that she had embraced Islam out of her free choice and had solemnised a free-will marriage with Azhar Ali without any fear or pressure.

The counsel told the judge that in view of the reported statement of the teenage girl, the SHC had purportedly restrained police from arresting her husband Azhar Ali and his family members. Therefore, he asked the court to grant post-arrest bail to applicants Shariq Ali and Mohsin Ali, who are brothers of Azhar Ali, and Danish — all of whom are policemen.

After hearing arguments from the state prosecutor and the defence counsel, the judge granted post-arrest bail to Shariq Ali, Mohsin Ali and Danish, who is said to be posted at the Frere police station, against a surety of Rs50,000 each. The court directed the suspects to cooperate with police during the investigation of the case.

Arzoo's family members earlier this month told Dawn that her purported husband Azhar lived in a house opposite to their's along with his family and he is at least 45 years old. ""The rascal who abducted her has prepared fake papers to show that she is 18 years old,” her mother said.

According to the first information report of the case registered on his complaint, Arzoo's father Raja stated that on Oct 13, he and his wife went to work while their son Shahbaz had gone to school. The complainant said his three daughters, including Arzoo, were present at their home in Railway Colony when he received a call from a relative, who told him that Arzoo was missing from the house.

Raja said he reached home and contacted their neighbours, but could not trace his daughter. He subsequently lodged a case regarding the abduction of his daughter against unknown persons at the Frere police station.","['Dr. Salaria', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'M.

He subsequently lodged a case regarding the abduction of his daughter against unknown persons at the Frere police station.","['postarrest', 'christian', 'detained', 'girl', 'bilawal', 'arzoo', 'ali', 'review', 'case', 'courts', 'govt', 'marriage', 'statement', 'sindh', 'azhar', 'court', 'underage', 'family']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2017/07/596c5cdfdfcdf.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/07/596c5cdfdfcdf.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/10/5f9336acb6d74.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd329902b790.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/10/5f9bfc9932b5f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2019/04/5cadab92a5267.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/04/5cadab92a5267.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/10/5f9336acb6d74.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/10/5f9bfc9932b5f.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/10/5f9bfc9932b5f.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': ""The PPP leader's statement comes a day after 3 policemen who allegedly abducted 13-year-old Arzoo were granted bail."", 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1587815', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Sindh govt will approach courts to review underage Christian girl marriage case: Bilawal', 'description': ""The PPP leader's statement comes a day after 3 policemen who allegedly abducted 13-year-old Arzoo were granted bail."", 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/10/5f9bfc9932b5f.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1587815', 'title': 'Sindh govt will approach courts to review underage Christian girl marriage case: Bilawal', 'description': ""The PPP leader's statement comes a day after 3 policemen who allegedly abducted 13-year-old Arzoo were granted bail."", 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/10/5f9bfc9932b5f.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-10-30 17:41:36', 'modified_time': '2020-10-30 17:41:36', 'tag': 'Violence against Christians', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/202/dawn-com'}, 'keywords': 'Violence against Christians', 'news_keywords': 'Violence against Christians', 'author': 'Dawn.com'})",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dawn,,2020-10-30

Sujawal SSP Suhaee Aziz Talpur and social activist Hameed Alwani said at the seminar organised by Aga Khan Council for Thatta and Shahbandar on Wednesday that awareness should be created in population about social evils to ensure a better future for children.

Ms Talpur contended that unfortunately in lower Sindh because of poverty and lack of awareness the graph of primary education was the lowest. Police were available to eradicate social evils if people came forward and joined hands with law enforcers, she said.

Mr Alwani told the audience that child abuse incidents had risen from 12 to 15 children per day across the country.

He disclosed that 3,445 cases had occurred in 2017 which increased by 11pc; figures reached 3,834 in 2018. In 2019, it increased further, he said, adding that more abuse cases went unreported.

Police said the woman, 48, belongs to Kahuta and got married 21 years ago. Relations between the couple started getting bitter over the marriage of their elder daughter, as her husband was against the marriage.

The investigating officer, while quoting the victim’s statement, said that as the marriage date of her daughter was approaching, her husband had been behaving well, contrary to his attitude previously.

She alleged in her statement that while her daughter had gone to her relatives’ house, her husband came to her room and doused petrol on her.

After that he set her on fire. Upon hearing her screaming, her son and two of her relatives rushed to her rescue and extinguished the fire.

The victim received critical burns and was shifted to Holy Family Hospital, where she recorded her statement, which led to the registration of a case against her husband. Police said raids are underway to arrest the accused.

2185,1198,224,https://www.dawn.com/news/1533984,2/12/20 7:00,Sindh police law,"POST 18th Amendment, some quarters have questioned the status and validity of Police Order (PO) 2002 as a strictly provincial subject, which has lacked perspective of ground realities. Historically, federal law-enforcement authorities have remained active in maintaining peace in Karachi, which is why evaluating police law exclusively through the prism of provincial autonomy doesn’t seem appropriate. In a country where criminal law, evidence law and the senior police leadership (PSP) primarily belong to the federal structure — owing to internal security challenges and resource constraints faced by the provinces — it is difficult to clearly demarcate federal and provincial domains.

Even prior to the ongoing Rangers-led operation in Karachi, the city depended on federal reinforcements. Likewise, KP and Balochistan sought federal financing for law-enforcement projects such as conversion of ‘B’ into ‘A’ areas, raising the Balochistan Constabulary and the integration of forces of former Fata into the KP police.

In May 2019, the Sindh Assembly passed an amended bill; as per Article 116 (2A) it was forwarded to the governor. Following Article 116(2-B), the governor returned the bill for reconsideration to the Assembly. In June 2019, it was reconsidered, passed and forwarded to him. Since the governor did not assent within the 10 days specified in Article 116(3), the bill was deemed as passed.

The new law is known as the Sindh (Repeal of the Police Act, 1861 and Revival of Police Order 2002) Amendment Act 2019, and contains several flaws, eg the adopted law merged the previously exclusive public safety commissions and complaints commissions as a single entity. Meanwhile, Article 4 defines 22 duties of the police, including assistance to victims — but without increasing financial allocation, capacity building, and accountability; such an exhaustive list will remain an ideal. Then, Article 8 requires police departments to be organised on a functional basis, but the new law dropped the idea of ‘police accountability’ incorporated in Article 8 (2-E) in the original PO 2002. Naturally, without accountability, policing will face a public trust deficit.

How will the logical end be achieved without restructuring the police?

The inherited colonial policing model primarily catered to rural needs, although PO 2002 tried to address issues confronting both rural and urban policing. To meet urban challenges, PO 2002 introduced the concept of Capital City Police (CCP), but the recently adopted law omitted it. For big cities, Sir Oliver Gilbert Grace and Justice Cornelius recommended the commissionerate system in 1950 and 1962, which ensured functional autonomy of the police chief and improved public safety. The police committee headed by Aslam Hayat in 1985 also advised restructuring policing on the lines of a commissionerate system; they believed it would improve decision-making, response and accountability within the police. However, the adopted law seems averse to the needs of metropolitan policing.

In pre-independence Kolkata, the Calcutta Police Act, 1866, provided a way for a commissionerate system. Till independence, the city had 16 police chiefs; and after independence, 26 police commissioners were rotated. Now, Kolkata is the 15th most populated city in the world while Karachi is placed at 11. For Calcutta, the imperialists realised the need for an exclusive commissionerate system, but owing to an intense romance with the colonial-rural policing model, we seem to be enamoured of the status quo. This is apparent in the newly adopted law which has ignored the specific needs of command, operations, capacity building and public safety.

Although the National Action Plan says that the ongoing operation in Karachi will be taken to its logical end, how will that logical end be achieved without empowering and restructuring the police?

The adopted law amended the composition and selection process for members of the provincial and district public safety commissions, and the police complaints commissions. In the original PO 2002, the district public safety commission had eight to 12 members; half the members are to be district councillors, while the remaining are independent members. In the adopted law, one-third are to be elected members of the national and provincial assemblies; one-third district councillors; and the remaining independent members. Historically, district councils remained under the political influence of the party in power.

The enormity of internal security threats warrant that the law incorporate and address the needs of the CCP and reconnect the Sindh police law with the national public safety commission and National Police Bureau. To make the police true custodians of public safety, their composition needs to be amended in a way so that a balanced approach is attained while the IGP is empowered so that he has the exclusive authority to compose his team.

To meet urban challenges, PO 2002 introduced the concept of Capital City Police (CCP), but the recently adopted law omitted it.
This is apparent in the newly adopted law which has ignored the specific needs of command, operations, capacity building and public safety.
The adopted law amended the composition and selection process for members of the provincial and district public safety commissions, and the police complaints commissions.
The enormity of internal security threats warrant that the law incorporate and address the needs of the CCP and reconnect the Sindh police law with the national public safety commission and National Police Bureau.","['public', 'members', 'adopted', 'safety', 'po', 'policing', 'article', 'sindh', '2002', 'provincial', 'law']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/02/5e435c1deca44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/02/5e435c1deca44.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd329902b790.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/02/5e435c1deca44.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'How will the logical end be achieved without restructuring the police?', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1533984', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Sindh police law', 'description': 'How will the logical end be achieved without restructuring the police?', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/02/5e435c1deca44.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1533984', 'title': 'Sindh police law', 'description': 'How will the logical end be achieved without restructuring the police?', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/02/5e435c1deca44.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-02-12 07:00:58', 'modified_time': '2020-02-12 07:00:58', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/2112/mohammad-ali-babakhel'}, 'author': 'Mohammad Ali Babakhel'})",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dawn,,2020-02-12
2188,1201,242,https://www.dawn.com/news/1547062,4/7/20 7:02,Nausheen to lead FBR amid big tax revenue shortfall,"ISLAMABAD: Amid massive tax revenue shortfalls during the first nine months of the current fiscal year, the government on Monday appointed Nausheen Amjad chief of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).

At the same time, the cabinet also approved termination of the honorary/pro-bono appointment of Shabbar Zaidi as FBR chairman with immediate effect.

The post fell vacant in February when Mr Zaidi went on an indefinite medical leave only days after resuming office on Jan 21. In his absence, Ms Nausheen, who was posted as FBR administration member, has been looking after the office of chairman as well.

Prime Minister Imran Khan appointed Mr Zaidi as FBR chairman in May 2019 with a vision that he would bring about desired reforms and work towards achieving the revenue collection target of Rs5.5 trillion projected for the current fiscal year.

Eleven months later, the federal cabinet through circulation on Monday approved the summary of a selection committee that unanimously recommended Ms Nausheen, a BS-22 officer of Inland Revenue Services (IRS), for the position of FBR chairperson with an immediate effect.

High-ups in the FBR believe that delay in the filling top positions of member operations in IRS and Customs in the board has caused uncertainty within the tax department, leading to revenue bleeding on a daily basis.

Names of several bureaucrats were in circulation for the FBR chairman appointment including the name of Tariq Mehmood Pasha of IRS, currently serving as Secretary Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan, Director General Customs Intelligence Zahid Khokhar, Member Customs Policy Javed Ghani and Additional Secretary Finance Ahmed Mujtaba Memon.

According to a source, PM Khan himself approved Ms Nausheen’s appointment as the chairperson of the FBR. The delay in the appointment of the chairperson and a special assistant on revenue was blocked by a powerful group close to the prime minister, the source said, adding that the reshuffle in cabinet and other key decisions taken on Monday would also pave the way for the appointment of special assistant on revenue.

Adviser to the PM on Finance and Revenue Dr Hafeez Shaikh also gave his nod for the appointment of a special assistant on revenue to look after the revenue division affairs under his supervision, the source said.

According to the source, the new chairperson has been tasked with the removal of all officers with tainted reputation and to replace them with competent and honest officers. The new chairperson would discuss with the finance adviser the postings and transfers of officials, the source said, adding that the PM was not happy with the news in circulation about alleged corruption within the tax machinery.

Cumulatively, the FBR missed tax revenue targets by a whopping Rs470bn during the nine-month period from July 2019 till March 2020, as the total collections during the period reached Rs3.050 trillion against the revised target of 3.520tr.

Mr Durrani said the alleged killer had also shot and injured his father in October 2017, but was forgiven by his father.","['maternal', 'kills', 'accused', 'shot', 'swabi', 'zaida', 'durrani', 'station', 'uncle', 'teenage', 'boy', 'killed', 'father', 'relatives']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189f00b83e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0d52ba8a43.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1fdf8b0b58.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d005917e0.jpg?0.8785461548197806', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd192bbacb28.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1793dc4884.jpg?r=1459847184', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21824a8678.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd179607e531.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189916390d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0ec56aad75.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f0c8e29e4.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd22283a73d3.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18a3ece187.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fc7833a64a3a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd17990224f6.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f94d8916a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f4142e469.jpg', 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}",TRUE,http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'SWABI: A teenage boy killed his father and two other relatives in Swabi tehsil here on Sunday, police said.\n\nSHO...', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1573522', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Teenage boy kills father, two relatives in Swabi', 'description': 'SWABI: A teenage boy killed his father and two other relatives in Swabi tehsil here on Sunday, police said.\n\nSHO...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1573522', 'title': 'Teenage boy kills father, two relatives in Swabi', 'description': 'SWABI: A teenage boy killed his father and two other relatives in Swabi tehsil here on Sunday, police said.\n\nSHO...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-08-10 07:15:47', 'modified_time': '2020-08-10 07:15:47', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/391/the-newspaper-s-correspondent'}, 'author': ""The Newspaper's Correspondent""})",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dawn,,2020-08-10
2196,1209,263,https://www.dawn.com/news/1590293,11/14/20 7:12,Restorative justice,"A CONSTANT stream of reports of violence against women and children has given rise to widespread outrage against impunity for such crimes and loud calls for accountability. There are, however, differing views regarding the form of accountability. Following the rape of a woman on a motorway in Lahore more than two months ago, the government called for greater punishments for sexual crimes, including public hangings and castration. Advocates for victims of violence, on the other hand, stressed that calls for stringent punishment detract attention from the failure of the criminal justice system to prosecute and punish these crimes.

While the government and activists were at odds over the emphasis of the response, there was no disagreement that justice in these cases should take the form of criminal accountability. Movements for ending violence against women have also, for the large part, viewed a ‘successful’ outcome to be that which leads to prison. But in spite of years of brave and committed activism, the criminal justice system consistently fails to punish and prevent gender-based violence. At this stage, where awareness of the scale of sexual violence is arguably higher than ever before and yet any improvement in the justice system is imperceptible, it’s important to consider whether criminal accountability is worth its central place in our activism and if alternatives to imprisonment for violent crimes should be considered.

Restorative justice offers a different perspective to accountability. Restorative justice approaches place the victim’s needs and preferences at the centre of the accountability approach. The alternative to the punitive measures is a dialogue between the victim and the perpetrator, which often includes family and community members. The victim has the opportunity to decide what reparation would look like, and the perpetrator is to take measures to atone for his acts instead of going to prison.

With the growing recognition that an adversarial criminal justice system offering only punitive outcomes is inherently incapable of healing victims and making communities safer, restorative justice approaches are being pursued as alternatives to criminal accountability in some parts of the world. In New York City, for example, a restorative justice project known as Common Justice is offered to victims of violence as an alternative to the criminal justice process. It should be no surprise that 90 per cent of the victims of violence, when given the option to choose, prefer the restorative justice project. Procedural obstacles and uncertain outcome of the criminal justice system disempowers the victims and does not offer any sense of closure, while the restorative justice process affirms the victim’s agency and increases chances of some form of reparation.

Once criminal accountability is initiated, victims and their families can lose control over the process

As a lawyer who has counselled and represented many victims of violence, I have come to realise that the criminal justice option is often undesirable. Victims sometimes pursue it because it is the only mode of accountability available, but the arduous system ridden with delays and humiliations leaves many exhausted and burnt out. Once the criminal accountability process is initiated, victims and their families tend to lose any control over the process. Investigation and prosecution of crimes is handed over to the law-enforcement authorities, state-appointed prosecutors and judges, and the victim’s needs and well-being are ancillary. Far from attaining justice, victims and their families are often subjected to the exploitation and corruption of the law-enforcement authorities.

The criminal justice approach becomes particularly undesirable when we consider that in a majority of violent incidents against women and children, the perpetrators are well-known to the victims. Women facing violence from intimate partners and children experiencing sexual abuse from close family members often do not want prison for the perpetrators. They also know that the prison sentences will be temporary and fear what will happen when the perpetrator comes out from the system that offers no rehabilitative services at all.

There are certainly plausible feminist concerns about the restorative justice process. Feminists have struggled for decades for violence against women to be recognised as a public harm, and it may seem that restorative justice approaches take patriarchal violence back to the private sphere. Restorative justice approaches, however, recognise that violence against women constitutes a societal harm and therefore involves community members in the accountability process. Community members are expected to facilitate the dialogues, and a crucial component of the restorative justice process involves community recognition of the harm that has taken place.

It is also important to distinguish the restorative justice approach from informal justice mechanisms, commonly known as jirgas, employed in Pakistan. Such informal mechanisms typically give the authority to patriarchal ‘heads’ of the community to mediate between the victim’s family and perpetrators, thereby removing the agency of the victim to shape the accountability process, which is a core principle of restorative justice. Proponents of restorative justice emphatically distinguish it from mediation, which requires a third party to ‘resolve’ differences in a way that is acceptable to all parties. In contrast, compromise or even forgiveness are not necessary outcomes of the restorative justice process; instead, the goal is to support the victim in determining the kinds of reparations that would bring her closure and seeing to it that the perpetrator takes these steps.

Undoubtedly, developing effective restorative justice processes in Pakistan will be challenging. A fundamental question in our context is whether deeply patriarchal communities can ever be trusted to facilitate the process in a way that is fair to the victim. But the complexity of the task should not deter us from exploring its possibilities. Given the scale of gender-based violence and the dire shortage of solutions within existing frameworks, we must broaden our notion of justice to include processes and outcomes that fall outside the limited scope of criminal accountability and emphasise healing for victims and societies.

2200,1213,289,https://www.dawn.com/news/1577597/punjab-police-bureaucracy-reshuffle-again-follows-pms-visit,9/3/20 6:48,"Punjab police, bureaucracy reshuffle again follows PM’s visit","LAHORE: Tuesday night police and bureaucracy reshuffle was yet another such exercise in Punjab during the two-year PTI rule that either coincided with prime minister’s presence in Lahore or came immediately after he left the city for Islamabad.

It strengthens the perception of Punjab being remote-controlled from the Centre. The prime minister instrumented a major bureaucratic reshuffle in November last year and continued shuffling the bureaucracy in between. In July, the PM came to Lahore and as he left, the newly posted Lahore Division commissioner and secretary services were transferred, while a provincial minister was made to resign.

Some of the transfers and postings in Punjab police were surprising. Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Zulfiqar Hameed was reportedly transferred despite Inspector General of Police (IGP) Shoaib Dastgir not being in favour of the move.

The regional police officers (RPOs) of Rawalpindi, Sahiwal and Dera Ghazi Khan were also reshuffled as well as several district police officers (DPOs).

Sources privy to the development said the transfer of the CCPO, RPOs and DPOs of Jhang, Mandi Bahauddin and Gujrat was not unexpected. But what surprised the police circles was the reshuffle being announced on the day of arrival of the prime minister in Lahore, suggesting the provincial police officer was not in the loop.

Sources said the IGP had just resisted the transfer of CCPO Hameed whom he believed was a competent officer. The police chief was taken into confidence over the remaining transfers/postings, they said, rejecting the impression that the reshuffle was politically motivated.

Specialised Protection Unit (SPU) Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Umar Sheikh has replaced Mr Hameed as the CCPO for his ‘daring and merit-based initiatives’.

An official said Mr Sheikh had been interviewed by a team of the federal government that recently visited Lahore and recommended his name to the prime minister for the post.

As the PM was unhappy over the reforms in the Lahore police, he okayed the name of Mr Sheikh for his apparent reputation as a professional. Mr Hameed has been transferred and posted as the additional inspector general (operations), while Bilal Siddique Kamyana, awaiting posting, has been posted as the SPU DIG.

Rawalpindi RPO Sohail Habib Tajik has been transferred as he was set to attend a course for promotion to BS-21. He has been replaced by Dera Ghazi Khan RPO Imran Ahmar. The official said Mr Ahmar was willing to be transferred and Chief Minister Usman Buzdar had entertained his request in this regard.

DIG (Logistics) retired captain Muhammad Faisal Rana has been transferred and posted as the DG Khan RPO, as the IGP had shortlisted his name for being a competent, upright and professional police officer. The performance of Mr Rana was acknowledged when he served as the Rawalpindi city police officer.

Sahiwal RPO Humayun Bashir Tarar had also requested the IGP for transfer to a non-field assignment owing to some “family issues”. He has been replaced by Punjab Highway Patrol DIG Tariq Abbas Qureshi.

The official said the transfer of the Pakpattan DPO again stirred a controversy. He claimed that the CM was upset with DPO Sahibzada Bilal Umar for lodging a first information report against a local Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf MPA on the complaint of the local lawyers community.

Mr Umar has been posted as the Punjab Constabulary senior superintendent of police (headquarters) in Farooqabad, while no officer has replaced him as the DPO yet. He is the fifth police chief of the district to have been transferred in two years since the incumbent government took charge.

The transfer of Jhang DPO Sardar Ghias Gull had also been under discussion at the Central Police Office (CPO) due to his alleged aggressive policy against the political leadership. Many PTI leaders had allegedly complained to the chief minister against him, as per the official, that he went down hard on them as he was to proceed abroad for scholarship and took an opportunity to create an impression of a ‘tough officer’. He had already submitted an application for official leave.

His services have been placed with the CPO and no incumbent posted as replacement yet.

Moreover, Gujrat and Mandi Bahauddin DPOs Tauseef Haider and Nasir Sial, respectively, were already under consideration for transfer by the IGP. Faisalabad Senior Superintendent of Police (Operations) Ali Raza has been transferred and posted as the Mandi Bahauddin DPO, while the post in Gujrat has been assigned to Umar Farooq Salamat, an inquiries assistant inspector general (AIG) at the CPO.

Mr Salamat has been replaced by Mr Haider as the AIG, while Mr Sial has been posted as the SPU additional director (administration).

Also, Lahore Superintendent of Police (Security) Bilal Zafar Sheikh has been given the charge of the Chiniot DPO. He has been replaced by Hafizabad DPO Bilal Iftikhar.

Faisalabad’s Ali Raza and Lahore’s Bilal Sheikh will be heading a district for the first time and have been provided the opportunity by the IGP keeping in view their good performance, an official said.

BUREAUCRACY: The prime minister came to Lahore on Tuesday to chair the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project and as he left, another batch of five administrative secretaries, a commissioner and five deputy commissioners were transferred.

Late on Tuesday night, the Punjab government notified the transfer of secretary coordination to chief minister Javed Mahmood Akhtar, who was posted as Multan division commissioner. Multan Commissioner Shanul Haq was transferred and asked to report to S&GAD.

Prosecution department secretary Nabeel Javed has been transferred and posted as chief economist, while MD PEF Nadeem Sarwar has been transferred and posted as secretary prosecution.

Secretary I&C Masood Mukhtar has been transferred and his services have been placed at the disposal of P&D Board and Population Welfare department secretary Ali Bahadur Qazi has been transferred and posted as secretary MPDD. Nadeemur Rehman has been posted as secretary human rights.

Toba Tek Singh deputy commissioner Amna Munir was made OSD and replaced by Umer Javed.

Sahiwal Deputy Commissioner Zeeshan Javed has been transferred and posted as DC Sialkot, relieving Nasir Mahmood, who has been asked to report to the S&GAD. Sahiwal ADC (Revenue) Awais Mushtaq has been posted as Sahiwal DC.

Mandi Bahauddin DC Mehtab Waseem Azhar has been transferred and made OSD, while Tariq Ali Basra has been posted as Mandi Bahauddin DC. OSD Saif Anwar has been posted as Gujrat DC against the post vacated by Dr Khurram Shahzad.

According to the document, in a crisis such as the Covid-19 pandemic, women face considerable threats to their economic, physical, legal and social security.

The lack of emergency services especially exacerbates issues of access and relief for women and girls across the following four areas: reproductive health, gender-based violence, education and economic resilience, the document points out.

The document has been brought together through extensive input and feedback from experts in the field.

It recommends immediate legislative action such as expanding the definition of essential services to include all gender-based violence (GBV) response services and mechanisms to safeguard against any disruption during any emergency or disaster situations, strengthening services and ensuring access for GBV survivors during all emergencies, including Covid-19.

The policy also calls for expediting the implementation of the Sindh Reproductive Healthcare Rights Act 2019.

Need stressed to implement laws and prevent gender-based violence

The launch was also attended by parliamentarians, members of civil society, members of labour unions and many stakeholders.

Nuzhat Shirin, chairperson of the SCSW, welcomed the participants and highlighted the policy document, explaining immediate actions the SCSW took during Covid-19 pandemic.

Farida Shaheed, executive director, Shirkat Gah, presented the policy document’s key takeaways and urged present members of the Sindh government to take the policy up and ensure its timely implementation.

Aliya Shahid, secretary, Women Development Department (WDD), commended the policy document and stated that under the WDD platform, Sindh government carried out most pro-women legislation.

Dr Talib Lashari, a senior consultant, emphasised the rights of women and said that women’s rights could not be ensured until they invest in human capital and until poverty and education were focused on.

Virjee Kohli, special assistant, Sindh Human Rights Department, said that there was a need to implement laws and prevent gender-based violence incidents that affected young girls and women.

Khawar Mumtaz, former chairperson of the National Commission on the Status of Women, spoke on the policy document and stated that the interrelationships of different issues faced by women had been taken into account.

Dr Yasmin Qazi, senior technical adviser to Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, highlighted the importance of reproductive rights, and the need for gender sensitivity among men.

Barrister Murtaza Wahab, Adviser to Chief Minister of Sindh on Law and Environment, gave the closing remarks and complimented the SCSW and SG for the launch of the policy document. “We have too many challenges as a country and we need to rise to these challenges,” he said.

Barrister Wahab highlighted that there was a need for implementation and delivery of laws especially towards gender-based violence cases.

2205,1218,301,https://www.dawn.com/news/1590438,11/15/20 7:27,Special courts for speedy trial of rape cases planned,"ISLAMABAD: The government is all set to promulgate next week an ordinance seeking establishment of special courts for speedy trial of rape cases, suggesting steps for protection of witnesses and creating a separate prosecution network for this purpose.

This was said by Adviser to the Prime Minister on Parliamentary Affairs Babar Awan during an exclusive chat with Dawn hours after Prime Minister Imran Khan through a tweet announced that the government had planned to bring a “stringent and holistic anti-rape ordinance closing all loopholes”.

The prime minister had posted the tweet after talking to Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) of Sindh police Mohammad Bux Buriro on phone, who had played a major role with his daughter in the arrest of a man accused of raping a woman and her minor daughter in Kashmore.

Mr Awan, who is also a member of the Cabinet Committee on Legislative Cases, said the prime minister was very much concerned over the recent incidents of rape in different parts of the country.

He said the ordinance had been drafted in line with the prime minister’s directives to his legal team for preparing the law covering “four sides”, including protection of the victim so that her personal trauma could not become public and protection of witnesses.

Mr Awan said under the proposed law rape cases would not be investigated by ordinary police officials and only a gazzeted officer up to the level of DIG (deputy inspector general) or SSP (senior superintendent of police) would monitor these cases. He said the proposed law also suggested steps for speedy disposal of cases. He said in the last few years, over 21,000 rape cases were registered in the country and “only few hundreds of them could go for trial”.

To cover the loopholes and ensure timely justice, a new and separate prosecution network was being created, the adviser said.

Giving details, he said the properties of the convicts in such cases would be forfeited for paying compensation to the victims.

In order to create deterrence in the society, he said, “ultimate and stringent punishments” would be awarded to the culprits. He did not elaborate the measures which the law suggests for this purpose, but ruled out the option of public hanging as demanded by several political leaders, including some ministers.

Mr Awan said special courts would be set up in all the divisions to prevent delay in completion of the trials.

When his attention was drawn towards the criticism from the opposition over the government for relying on presidential ordinances for legislation, Mr Awan said the 18th Amendment had validated promulgation of ordinances which were considered “valid legislation” in many countries, including the US.

Moreover, he said, ordinances were promulgated when the parliament was not in session. He said since the parliament was not in session these days due to Covid-19 situation, ordinances could be promulgated by the government as per the constitution. And these ordinances, he added, eventually went to the parliament which finally enacted the laws.

As far as the opposition’s criticism was concerned, “the opposition loves and adores only one ordinance namely National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO),” he said in an apparent reference to the ordinance promulgated by the former military dictator Gen Pervez Musharraf in 2007 ending cases registered against people on political grounds.

Earlier, Prime Minister Imran Khan through his official social media account on Twitter lauded ASI Buriro and his daughter for showing bravery in the arrest of the Kashmore rape suspect.

“Spoke to ASI Buriro lauding his and his daughter’s exemplary initiative and courage in arrest of Kashmore rapist. The nation is proud of them and he has given positive uplift to image of police,” wrote the prime minister.

Sindh police had managed to arrest the alleged rapist of a woman and her four-year daughter in Kashmore with the help of ASI Buriro and his daughter, who trapped the main accused through a covert operation.

Speaking at a news conference in Karachi on Friday, Sindh government spokesperson Murtaza Wahab had said they would write to the Centre to bestow the highest police award on ASI Buriro and civil award on his daughter for the role they had played in arresting the main suspect.

The spokesperson’s comments came a day after a man was arrested for allegedly subjecting the woman and her minor daughter to rape for two days after duping the women with a job offer in northern Sindh’s Kashmore district.

Kashmore police had set up a trap by using a decoy, the daughter of ASI Buriro. The victim along with the ASI’s daughter contacted the main suspect over phone and invited him to a hotel where police arrested him.

2208,1221,315,https://www.dawn.com/news/1578016,9/5/20 7:05,Supreme Court sees no honour in honour killings,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Friday observed that the killing of women in the name of honour had never been an honourable practice, saying such murders should not be categorised as honour killings.

“It will help deter such killings if the term ‘Ghairat’ is not used to describe them,” observed Justice Qazi Faez Isa in a judgement he authored while hearing a jail petition.

A two-judge bench headed by Justice Isa had taken up the jail appeal of Mohammad Abbas against the Sept 8, 2015 verdict of the Lahore High Court in the murder case of his wife, Saima Bibi.

Justice Isa regretted that not enough was being done to discourage crimes against women as extremism and violence have permeated through Pakistani society and it has been brutalised.

Justice Isa says not enough is being done to discourage crime against women

Mohammad Abbas was facing the allegation of killing his wife over suspected infidelity. Saima Bibi was the sister of Mohammad Asghar, the complainant who reported to police that his sister was killed by her husband. The crime was stated to have been committed at 1am on May 17, 2009 and an FIR was registered at the Baraghar police station, Nankana Sahib district.

Mohammad Abbas was tried by the sessions judge of Nankana Sahib who convicted and awarded death sentence to the accused for qatl-i-amd (murder) of his wife. He was also directed to pay compensation of Rs50,000 to the legal heirs of the deceased and in default of the payment he would face six-month simple imprisonment.

The high court, however, reduced the sentence of death to imprisonment for life because the accused had fired only once at the deceased.

The Supreme Court, however, dismissed the jail appeal on the grounds that there was no reason justifying the grant of leave as the trial court determined that the petitioner killed his wife while the high court upheld the conviction though reduced the sentence to life imprisonment.

Referring to honour killing, Justice Isa explained that it was inaccurate to translate Urdu word ‘Ghairat’ into English as ‘honour’, adding that the Urdu word did not have an exact English equivalent.

A more accurate translation of the trait of ‘Ghairat’ would be ‘arrogance’ and the one with such a trait is an ‘arrogant’ person.

Pakistan has one of the highest, if not the highest per capita honour killings in the world and predominantly the victims are women, Justice Isa regretted, adding that by stating that murder was committed on the pretext of ghairat (honour) the murderer hopes to provide some justification for the crime.

It may also elevate the murderer’s social status with those not familiar with what Almighty Allah commands in the Holy Quran, Justice Isa observed.

This is unfortunate, more so because there is no honour in such killings, Justice Isa observed, adding that the parliament was rightly concerned with the prevalence of such killings and enacted legislation to dissuade, if not stop, such crimes.

It did so by ensuring that offenders do not avail of the benefit of section 302(c) PPC, for which the maximum punishment is twenty-five years imprisonment but which does not prescribe a minimum punishment, Justice Isa recalled.

2209,1222,334,https://www.dawn.com/news/1583767,10/7/20 20:03,Mirpur police arrest son of former AJK chief justice for allegedly harassing female doctor,"Police in Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s (AJK) Mirpur city arrested the son of a former chief justice of the AJK Supreme Court, Chaudhry Ibrahim Zia, for allegedly harassing a woman for the past two years in Muzaffarabad, it emerged on Wednesday.

The arrest of the suspect, Arsalan Zia, who is a BS-17 ad-hoc employee in the Information Technology section of the AJK high court, was made at around midnight on an application filed by the victim’s father — an advocate who hails from the Kotli district — at around 11:15pm on Tuesday.

According to the complaint, a copy of which is available with Dawn, the victim, who studied medicine in Muzaffarabad from 2014 to 2019, lived in a hostel that was owned by the suspect’s father and built largely on the course of a water channel near the prime minister’s house.

The complainant alleged that in December 2018, his daughter noticed that the suspect would covertly take pictures of female students from the roof of the hostel, which he would visit on the pretext of checking the building's maintenance.

“After some time, my daughter started receiving calls and messages from different numbers by the suspect who would ask her to maintain relations with him,” he alleged, adding that on her refusal, the suspect started threatening her while boasting about the position of his father — then the serving chief justice.

The suspect would also chase her to and from the two teaching hospitals in Muzaffarabad in official vehicles with impunity and force her to take a ride with him, the complainant said.

According to him, since the suspect worked in the IT section, he had also hacked his daughter's social media accounts and copied her pictures and personal information to blackmail her.

“At least twice, he tried to bundle my daughter in an official vehicle — once in Muzaffarabad and the next time in Rawalpindi — but failed after she raised a hue and cry,” he said.

The complainant further said that his daughter completed her medical education in April 2020 and started a house job in Mirpur, but the suspect continued to harass her.

The suspect had been in Mirpur for the past few days but on Monday, he arrived at the hospital and threatened the woman in the presence of a senior doctor with death if she did not accompany him to contract marriage, the victim's father said.

He said that he had rushed from Kotli to Mirpur when a senior doctor informed him about the incident, in order to lodge a complaint with the police.

“My daughter is in a state of shock and depression. I want strict legal action not only against this guy who is her known tormentor but also his hidden colleagues,” he concluded.

After registering a first information report under sections 489H, 489 ZXD, 501(2) of Penal Code and section 11 of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Act, Mirpur Police took the suspect into custody.

Police sources said they believed that it was not an isolated incident involving one particular individual but a group of people harassing and intimidating women.

Police will scrutinise mobile numbers in the use of the suspect as well as his social media accounts to gather more information about such elements, the sources said.

Meanwhile, a senior Mirpur-based journalist claimed that the former chief justice had contacted some senior police officials, complaining that harsh sections had been incorporated in the FIR against his son.

Despite repeated attempts to contact DIG Mirpur Sardar Ilyas Khan and SSP Raja Irfan Salim, they could not be reached for comment.","['Tariq Naqash', 'Ibrahim S', 'One Nation', 'Marquis De Sade', 'Tahir A', 'Salam Shahid', 'Zeeshan Ahmed', 'Mumtaz Ahmed Shah', 'Noor Ahmad', 'Islamabad Diaries']","Police in Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s (AJK) Mirpur city arrested the son of a former chief justice of the AJK Supreme Court, Chaudhry Ibrahim Zia, for allegedly harassing a woman for the past two years in Muzaffarabad, it emerged on Wednesday.

2212,1225,341,https://www.dawn.com/news/1581476,9/25/20 7:25,Discontent in Lahore police over CCPO’s ‘conduct unbecoming’,"LAHORE: Many officers in the Lahore police are upset about what they say ‘aggressive and unbecoming’ conduct of newly appointed chief Umar Sheikh.

The police force panicked when the CCPO had some officials arrested and put them behind the bars while bypassing departmental procedure. He also allegedly used ‘improper words’ against senior officers in several formal and informal meetings.

Fed up with the behaviour of the Lahore CCPO, two police officials — training assistant sub inspector (T-ASI) and a head constable — complained to IGP Inam Ghani about the CCPO’s behaviour.

Meanwhile, the transfer of Lahore admin SSP Liaquat Malik late on Wednesday added fuel to fire. His transfer shocked the senior officers of the provincial capital police when they came to know that the CCPO had used improper words in his letter sent to the IGP.

The CCPO recommended to the Punjab police chief to place departmental action in the CR dossier of Mr Liaquat to disturb his promotion matter. This act further irritated the senior police officers in Lahore. He sent a copy to the Punjab chief minister too for further consideration, an action/punishment the other police officers declared excessive and uncalled for.

Mr Sheikh in the strong- worded letter mentioned Liaquat Malik as ‘irresponsible and non-professional officer’. He claimed that the SSP admin lacked ability to prepare an official presentation of a crime incident. The CCPO stated that he had asked Mr Liaquat to prepare a brief of incident of motorway gang-rape case that he (Umar Sheikh) was to present before the committee of the Senate.

The officer allegedly gave wrong details of the incident that could be embarrassing for the Punjab as well as the Lahore police, he said.

“Such presentation of distorted facts to the members of parliament standing committee on law and justice would have caused extreme embarrassment to the worthy IGP Punjab and the CCPO Lahore, called to brief the committee,” reads the official letter.

There were some reports that both sides exchanged arguments when the Lahore CCPO used ‘improper words’ against Mr Liaquat and the junior staff at a meeting a couple of days back. Following this correspondence, the admin SSP Lahore refused to work under the command of Mr Sheikh.

Consequently, the IGP transferred Mr Liaquat and posted him as assistant inspector general (AIG) discipline at the Central Police Office (CPO) against an existing vacancy late on Wednesday.

An official privy to the information said that the series of such incidents in which the CCPO adopted an aggressive policy prompted some other senior officers of the Lahore police to demand their transfer from the provincial capital to any other suitable place. He said two SSPs and an SP also approached the CPO while refusing to work under the command of the Lahore police chief.An application of police inspector and former SHO of Gujjarpura Syed Ahmad Raza Jafri is pending for approval for registration of FIR against the Lahore CCPO for the last one week or so.

CCPO Umar Sheikh said all his efforts were for the restoration of public confidence in the police force. He said his prime target are the forces resisting change.

“The police reforms are not possible unless we all overcome the forces of the status quo,” the CCPO said.

Contrary cases of infringement of minority rights invite universal condemnation. So, it is only a matter of time before women effectively obtain the rights that are guaranteed to them under most constitutions.

Objections against the slogan raise interesting issues. Consider the men who protest their support for women, but suggest more appropriate slogans. The irony in doing so is lost on them. This is precisely the suffocating embrace of patriarchy the women are contesting. By subjecting the modalities of struggle to their approval, men deny women the agency that is their right which includes the right to be wrong. Men deciding for women is an anachronism no longer acceptable to many.

But there is a deeper irony at play. This slogan, or at least its essence, was directed first to men. And, more surprisingly, it was not oppressed men raising it against their oppressors. Quite the contrary, it was the oppressors who forced ‘your body, your choice’ upon the oppressed.

Here is the back story. Capitalism, gaining strength in 17th- and 18th-century Europe, had two essential pillars: the sanctity of private property and the free availability of wage labour. Under feudalism, which preceded capitalism, labour was unfree, bound to feudal lords. In order to break this bond, the ideologues of capitalism extended the analogy of private property to the human body. The view was propagated that workers owned their bodies and could do with them what they chose free of the ties that indentured them to feudal lords. Meanwhile, the accompanying Enclo­sure Movement turned all land into private property depriving peasants of sustenance from common holdings. Thus were free labourers created to do with their bodies as they chose. It was another matter that the only choice was to sell their bodies to the highest bidder.

Objections against the slogan raise interesting issues.

There was one positive though unintended outcome of this new enslavement: the emergence of civil rights. The body, now private property, was entitled to the same protection as land or capital. Violating its sanctity became a crime subject to legal redress. And this set into motion a new dynamic in Europe. Once all bodies were acknowledged equal under the law, it was logical to demand an extension to the right to vote. A struggle for political rights ensued, progressively extending the franchise and culminating in universal suffrage; women were the last to be included, as late as the 1940s. Political rights were then leveraged to wrest economic rights like minimum wage, unemployment insurance, and retirement benefits. This journey from civil to economic rights was spread over almost 300 years, and it was not repeated in the same sequence in other parts of the world.

In South Asia, for example, one of the most unequal societies in the world, political rights came first, a consequence of the end of colonial rule. These political rights yielded a modicum of economic rights, most obvious in the case of Dalits in India. But conspicuous by their absence were any semblance of civil rights acknowledging the sanctity and equality of the human body. Dr. Ambedkar noted this straight away when he pointed out soon after Independence that one-person-one-vote could yield one-vote-one-value, but not one-person-one-value. Only a regime of civil rights could ensure the latter.

This brings us full circle to the ferocity encountered by the women’s movement and the underlying threat of interpersonal violence pervasive in South Asia. The infliction of pain on the human body is commonly viewed as a just and effective corrective. This explains popular views that South Asians can only be ruled by the stick, that suspects ought to be beaten till they confess, or that unpopular leaders should be strung upside down or lined up against a wall and shot. It is in this milieu that men could be slapped and women thrashed, or spat upon, or shamed to be taught a lesson with no consequences whatsoever.

We are far from the day when opposing views can be engaged with in a civil manner without threat of violence. The women’s movement, if only for highlighting this issue, is playing a salutary role in dragging us into a more civilised future.

Finally, one should not minimise the perils of translation. The body is just a body in the West. In South Asia, men, and many women, divest it of its vestments. The road to the future passes over rocky cultural terrain on which Neanderthals not only continue to roam, but are often invited to grace the insides of TV studios.

2221,1234,386,https://www.dawn.com/news/1574427,8/15/20 6:58,Woman booked for allegedly murdering her two daughters in Rawalpindi,"RAWALPINDI: A woman allegedly killed her two daughters and then attempted to commit suicide by drinking acid in Dhoke Ali Akbar Mandra on Friday. Her daughters were two and four.

She was shifted to the hospital where she is being guarded by police. A murder and attempted suicide case has been registered against her.

According to preliminary investigation, her and her husband had a brawl on Friday morning after which she “slashed her daughters’ throats and attempted to take her own life by drinking poison and stabbing herself.”

Superintendent of Police Zia Uddin Ahmed told Dawn that she was prevented from stabbing herself by her husband, who rushed to her rescue upon hearing the children screaming.

The SP said while quoting the mother that she had been suffering from mental illness for which she was receiving medical treatment. She said in her statement that she was “not being allowed to talk to her parents and visit them by her in-laws.”

“I had taken acid after killing my daughters and then wanted to slash my throat with the same knife but I was prevented by my husband,” he added, while quoting her.

Shortly after the incident was reported, he said, the police reached at the spot and shifted bodies of the girls to the hospital for postmortem. Their mother was also shifted to hospital. He said the motive behind the double murder of the two innocent girls was “domestic unrest.“

Meanwhile, five people were injured in a clash between a tenant and a house owner on Dhoke Imam Din Dhamial Road.

Batons, stones and knives were used during the brawl which left five people injured, one of them critically, police said.

He kept repeating his statement before police since his arrest, in Adilpur town of Ghotki district, on Aug 19. Currently on a 14-day police remand, Wahabullah was quoted as claiming that he and his adult children had received an edict from Almighty Allah through a “same dream” asking them to offer the sacrifice in order to avert a “disaster looming large on us”.

Brother claims area police conducted four raids on house but could not rescue victims

Indhar had seven sons and four daughters. He said he and his [surviving] sons sacrificed his three younger sons — Mahmood Ahsan, 4, Mahmood Asad, 3, and a newborn — and the daughters — Iqra, 18, Isra, 8, Sobia, 6, and Hajani, 5 — with a dagger (which has been taken into custody the police). The others slain by the suspects were Wahabullah’s wife, Ruqayya, 42, his eldest son Habibullah’s pregnant wife, Naseema, 19/21, and their two children, Nazia, 3, and one-year-old Ali Sher. Habibullah and his three brothers, Hizbullah, Kaleemullah and Majid, are in police custody for their alleged complicity in the gruesome offence. According to Wahabullah, he killed his wife and Naseema and the rest were killed by his three surviving sons. Majid was not accompanying him when the arrests were made. He was taken into custody the next day.

Although Wahabullah appeared happy and satisfied over the horrible act, his estranged brother, Mian Asad, revealed startling facts about the whole episode and accused the area police of not daring to “rescue the victims despite making no less than four attempts”.

Speaking to local reporters, Mian Asad said he was alarmed when came to know that Wahabullah and his sons were on their way to Adilpur [on Aug 19] and alerted the police. He said he knew that they intended to kill a daughter of his [Asad’s] former (divorced) wife. He said his former wife’s family and the area police were timely alerted and the suspects were nabbed.

Mian Asad also revealed that the Cantonment police of Pannu Aqil were approached many days before the incident with plea to rescue the “hostages” who had been confined to the house for one week and nobody was allowed to enter the house. He said Wahabullah had a pistol and he kept threatening the inmates as well as any visitor trying to go inside.

He said the police made four attempts, the last one a day before the incident, during the week but never dared to lay hands on Wahabullah, who every time threatened to shoot anyone trying to enter the house. He wondered why the police could not realise gravity of the situation despite being alerted about the lives of a large number innocent persons being in danger.

According to Mian Asad, Wahabullah’s neighbours stated that the suspects kept reciting some strange rhymes and playing music by beating some mettle pots on the fateful night but all this stopped at around midnight.

Meanwhile, Sukkur DIG Fida Hussain Mastoi told the media on Sunday that a thorough investigation into the incident was under way and the suspects were being interrogated. He said an inquiry into the role of the area police was also being conducted and departmental action would be taken if negligence was proved.

Regarding a post-mortem examination of the victims, Pannu Aqil taluka Hospital medical superintendent Salahuddin Ujjan said there was no evidence suggesting that any of the deceased was drugged before being killed.

He said his former wife’s family and the area police were timely alerted and the suspects were nabbed.","['house', 'fanatic', 'wife', 'alleged', 'family', 'wahabullah', 'taken', 'rescue', 'area', 'members', 'religious', 'sons', 'killer', 'pannu', 'turns', '11', 'suspects', 'aqil', 'asad']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2959763eb2.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f0c543fe8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/08/5f435c880ec42.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/08/5f3d14aeb82e8.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/01/5e2fae4d5711d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/08/5f3d14aeb82e8.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fbd36879d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e0fc3a04b.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/01/5e2fae4d5711d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/08/5f435c880ec42.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/08/5f435c880ec42.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'Brother claims area police conducted four raids on house but could not rescue victims.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1576123', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Alleged killer of 11 family members in Pannu Aqil turns out to be religious fanatic', 'description': 'Brother claims area police conducted four raids on house but could not rescue victims.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/08/5f435c880ec42.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1576123', 'title': 'Alleged killer of 11 family members in Pannu Aqil turns out to be religious fanatic', 'description': 'Brother claims area police conducted four raids on house but could not rescue victims.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/08/5f435c880ec42.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-08-24 06:30:13', 'modified_time': '2020-08-24 12:04:59', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/391/the-newspaper-s-correspondent'}, 'author': ""The Newspaper's Correspondent""})",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dawn,,2020-08-24

Police told journalists that on Sept 21 a resident of Qandeel Bala village in Madyan filed report that his son took his animals for grazing but he was found dead, hanging from a tree.

“My son took his animals for grazing to the nearby fields in the morning but he did not come back till evening. We went after him and a neigbour informed us that my son’s dead body was hanging from a tree,” said SSP Mohammad Nazir while quoting the father of the murdered boy.

He said that police rushed to the spot after registration of the report and collected evidence with the help of which they arrested some people including a prime suspect. During the initial investigation the prime suspect, a relative of the murdered boy, confessed to his crime, he said.

The SSP said that FIR was registered against the accused under section 302, 377, 53CPA and further investigation was underway from him. He said that 86 murder cases were reported by police in the current year and 75 of those were traced while nine other were untraced.

“We traced the culprits in the nine untraced cases and arrested all the accused in the cases,” he said, adding that the three major cases of robbery were also traced in which the culprits were arrested with recoveries.

The official said that unawareness and lack of responsibility on the part of parents were major causes of sexual harassment and violence. He urged parents to take care of their children and fulfill their responsibilities in that regard.

2226,1239,412,https://www.dawn.com/news/1588335/outrage-at-forced-marriages-of-underage-girls,11/3/20 7:40,Outrage at forced marriages of underage girls,"LAHORE: Women belonging to religious minorities have expressed outrage and condemnation at, what they say, the abduction and forced marriage of ‘minor’ Arzoo Raja in Karachi.

The Minority Women’s Forum (MWF) slammed the underage marriages of girls, especially those from religious minorities, in Pakistan who were abducted and made to change their religion.

“Under the Child Marriage Restraint Act this amounts to statutory rape,” said one of the members of the platform. “The case of Aarzoo Raja, which has recently gained traction is just the tip of the iceberg, but it brings attention to the multiple vulnerabilities of minor girls belonging to religious minorities who suffer the cross-sectional issues arising from social divisions based on class, caste, religion, and gender.”

She said various research studies have repeatedly explained disastrous consequences of underage marriages on the health of the girl child, especially if she has children and her deprivation from education which is a basic right.

“We believe in religious freedom so conversion out of free will is not the problem,” she said. “But if a girl is being abducted and forced to make a statement this is a social evil which has to be eliminated. There are several cases of other underage children who have had to suffer this.”

The Child Marriage Restraint Act must be implemented, she said.

The MWF also demanded comprehensive legal and policy measures at national and provincial levels to stop forced conversions and subsequent marriages of minority minor girls and to ensure that any religious conversion was done without any pressure and with free will as well as comprehensive anti-discrimination measures, legislative, policy and administrative initiatives to protect and promote the human rights of religious minorities, particularly of minority women and girls who often become victims of abduction, rape, forced religious conversion and underage marriage.

Also, the Cecils & Iris Chaudhry Foundation (CICF) also released a statement in the aftermath of the Arzoo Raja case, saying that with regard to the recent videos where Arzoo, 13, stating that she was not kidnapped and neither was she forced to convert to Islam, nor was she forcefully married to 44-year-old Ali Azhar and that it all happened with her consent, it could not be emphasized enough that Arzoo is only a minor, and a child.

“They can brainwash her to say anything,” said Michelle Chaudhry. “We have witnessed adults being brainwashed to carry out all kinds of violence, so what stops a child from being brainwashed? A 13-year-old child has no consent in this regard and neither does the law permit it. It is illegal to marry her, and subject her to sexual abuse and rape.”

Ms Chaudhry said that the child and all other such children must be handed back to their parents.

“In the garb of forcing children to convert to Islam and marrying them, pedophiles such as these abductors, are functioning with impunity. It is about time the government intervenes and puts an end to this. Our children need state protection which is their constitutional right.”

2232,1245,425,https://www.dawn.com/news/1541742,3/18/20 6:59,Rampant child abuse,"EACH year, the child protection advocacy group Sahil announces its findings on the scale of the abuse that children endure in this country; the data is collected by looking into newspaper reports on the sexual abuse of children (including rape and attempted rape), child marriage, and abducted and missing children. In its most recent statement, foraging through 84 newspapers, Sahil noted that a disturbing 2,846 cases were reported across the country in the previous year. In other words, approximately eight children were subjected to abuse each day of 2019, with more than half being girls (54pc). Prior to that, the figure was even higher at a staggering 3,832 in 2018 — the same year the body of young Zainab Ansari was found in a garbage heap in Kasur; she had been brutally raped and murdered by her captor. The incident sparked protests and demands for accountability across the country. To some degree, it also changed the way we think about the issue of sexual abuse of children, and finally led to the passage of the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Bill by the National Assembly and the Senate in recent weeks. While these figures may send a chill down the spine, they are likely only scratching the surface, as many other cases go unreported. It is only in recent years that a culture of talking about sexual abuse and exploitation has been encouraged in Pakistan, and that too only in certain sections of society. Many other stories will never see the light of day. It may even shock the more naive and insulated amongst us to learn about the exact scale of the problem, or about the capacity for evil in ‘ordinary’ people.

Children are one of the most vulnerable groups in any society, lacking the vocabulary, clear understanding, and often the support they need to confront their abusers. From a young age, they are taught not to question authority — the adults in their midst — and often suffer alone, suppressing whatever horrors they are made to endure in silence. Many abusers are from within the family, or close to the family members, earning and abusing their trust. In Sahil’s most recent data, the majority of children that were subjected to abuse were between the ages of six and 15, but there were some even under the age of one. Let the horror of that figure sink in.

In Sahil’s most recent data, the majority of children that were subjected to abuse were between the ages of six and 15, but there were some even under the age of one.","['child', 'children', 'sexual', 'zainab', 'subjected', 'society', 'scale', 'rampant', 'abuse', 'recent', 'country', 'young']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189f00b83e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0d52ba8a43.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f36c6fda5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d005917e0.jpg?0.8785461548197806', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21e3378567.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2319e875fb.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd21824a8678.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd189916390d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd195b8512b5.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0ec56aad75.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd22283a73d3.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18a3ece187.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fc7833a64a3a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f94d8916a.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1f4142e469.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24c3aad888.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd24e90196c5.jpg', 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}",TRUE,http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'EACH year, the child protection advocacy group Sahil announces its findings on the scale of the abuse that children...', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1541742', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Rampant child abuse', 'description': 'EACH year, the child protection advocacy group Sahil announces its findings on the scale of the abuse that children...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1541742', 'title': 'Rampant child abuse', 'description': 'EACH year, the child protection advocacy group Sahil announces its findings on the scale of the abuse that children...', 'image': 'http://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-03-18 06:59:49', 'modified_time': '2020-03-18 06:59:49', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/2677/editorial'}, 'author': 'Editorial'})",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dawn,,2020-03-18

The letter was written in response to complaints by Pakistani citizens living and working in Dubai. Signed by Community Welfare Attaché Saulat Saqib and available with Dawn, the letter informed the FIA that Pakistani citizens have filed applications against companies and agents that they claim are running fake companies in the UAE.

“They issued fake offer letters and visa approvals and charged huge amount from the applicants for their jobs in UAE,” it said.

The letter added: “It is requested to look into the matter and take necessary action for redressal of grievances of the applicants as per rules and procedure, under intimation to this mission.”

Letter to FIA, Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment sent in response to complaint by Pakistani citizens living, working in Dubai

The companies mentioned in the letter include Loyal Force Security, Al Nasir Al Byad Security, Najam Al Falak Security, NAS Security Services, Nokta Technical Services, Red Falcon Facility Management and Jehlam Technical Services.

The issue is very sensitive because a large number of Pakistani citizens suffer at the hands of fake agents, PTI MNA Ali Awan from Islamabad told Dawn.

“As I have been in the travel agency business for two decades, I am well aware of the miseries of the people who spend their life savings to travel abroad and in the end are deprived of everything,” he said.

“A number of Pakistanis are hired on promises that they will be get handsome salaries, medical, residential and other facilities, but after reaching they are shocked to see that none of the promises are fulfilled. Some Pakistanis even find that the companies that hired them practically do not exist,” Mr Awan went on.

To a question, he said that the PTI government was in the process of introducingan automated system that people can use to verify the status of recruiting agents. He said there was a list which mentions which agents “are reliable and which are not trustworthy”.

FIA Deputy Director Immigration Sajid Khokhar said that the agency has set up an Anti-Human Trafficking Cell that is involved in finding agents who deprive citizens of their money.

“Whenever a complaint is reviewed, not only are cases registered against the agents or recruiting agencies but strict action is also taken as no one can be allowed to recruit Pakistani citizens and then leave them on their own in the UAE or any other country,” he said.

In response to a question, he said that people cannot be stopped at airports as they travel on genuine visas and it is not possible to confirm whether the company they are going to work for exists.

“We work as a check post and only check the documentation. However zero tolerance is shown whenever such complaints are received,” he said.

The premier welcomed Facebook's investments and programmes in Pakistan and urged the company to increase their footprint, Radio Pakistan reported.

He also recognised the potential of digital platforms and the role they can play in providing global opportunities to the country's youth and entrepreneurs. The premier also noted how such opportunities can lift people out of poverty, the report said.

PM Imran raised concerns about the global rise in hate and extremism and acknowledged the immense challenge of fighting hate speech online.

The pair also discussed Facebook's connectivity investments and research grants awarded this year to Pakistan-based academics. Other topics touched upon during the meeting included Facebook's feature for donating blood, which has seen more than five million people sign up since it launched in-country, as well as the company's support for a polio-free Pakistan.

PM Imran and Sandberg also spoke about the latter's SheMeansBusiness programme, which is providing training to 6,700 women across the country.

The last time the pair met was in January during a meeting held at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.

The premier had invited tech firms to invest in Pakistan, and had asked Facebook to consider investments to support Pakistani incubators and help in digital literacy initiatives. At the time, Sandberg had invited the prime minister to visit Facebook's headquarters.","['Outsider Perspective', 'Nausheen Khan', 'Haider Shaikh', 'Something Haute', 'Ghulam Murtaza Khan', 'Dr. Salaria', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Bharat', 'Lahori Kid', 'Zia Uddin']","Prime Minister Imran Khan and Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg held a virtual meeting on Friday to discuss the social media giant's investments in Pakistan, its support for digital literacy initiatives and its work concerning Covid-19.

According to Larkana Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Nasir Aftab, the main suspect, Rafique Malik, was ""killed by the firing of co-accused Khairullah Bugti while he was taken to point out a hideout of his co-accused"" in the jurisdiction of Bakhshapur Police Station.

Bugti was later arrested along with the ""rifle after exchange of firing"", DIG Aftab told Dawn.com via text message.

A day earlier, police had arrested Malik for allegedly subjecting a woman and her minor daughter to rape for two days after duping the former with a job offer in Kashmore district.

At the time, police had said they had arrested the suspect using a trap while an accomplice was still at large.

On Friday, DIG Aftab said that during interrogation, ""the accused Rafique Malik disclosed a secret hideout of the remaining accused Khairullah Bugti at a local dargah near Bakhshapur.""

""As soon as the accused Rafique Malik along with police reached at the spot, the co-accused Khairullah started firing in which Malik died and co-accused [was] arrested with weapons,"" the DIG added.

False promise

Malik was suspected of raping a mother and her five-year-old daughter for two days after duping them into travelling to Kashmore from Karachi.

Both the victims hail from Karachi, according to Kashmore police. The woman had met Malik at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) in Karachi nearly a week ago, when he had ""promised the woman that he would get her a job at Kashmore Toll Plaza and she readily agreed”, a policeman said.

The woman arrived in Kashmore over the past weekend and met Malik. Two days later, she approached Kashmore police, alleging that he had raped her after she reached his residence, and he then handed her over to another man — Khairullah Bugti — living near the Sindh-Balochistan border. That man also allegedly raped the woman, according to a police officer.

The woman told police that the suspect held her minor daughter hostage, saying he would only let her go when she brought him another woman from Karachi. According to police, the suspect also gave her some money to cover her travelling expenses.

The trap

Kashmore police then devised a ploy to nab the suspect.

“Our ASI (assistant sub-inspector) Mohammad Bux Buriro persuaded his wife to talk to the suspect over phone which she did. Then the woman from Karachi and the ASI’s daughter waited in a park in Kashmore where the suspect was scheduled to meet them,” said Kashmore Station House Officer (SHO) Akbar Channa.

As soon as the suspect arrived there, police apprehended him, according to the SSP. He then led police to a cattle pen where he had kept the young girl. “The girl told police that he had subjected her to criminal assault,” the police officer said.

He explained that the trap was arranged and police needed a woman for this purpose so the suspect would be tricked into thinking the victim had brought another woman as he had desired. “Otherwise it would have been difficult to lay hands on him,” he said.

A case was registered against the two men on Tuesday on the complaint of Kashmore police under Sections 376 (punishment of rape), 344 (wrongful confinement for ten or more days), 420 (cheating) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code. Besides the two suspects, one unidentified person was also nominated in the case by police.

Later on Thursday, SSP Kashmore Amjad Ali Shaikh had said that Bugti had also subjected the woman to rape but spared her daughter.","['Mohammad Hussain Khan', 'Imtiaz Ali', 'M.

False promiseMalik was suspected of raping a mother and her five-year-old daughter for two days after duping them into travelling to Kashmore from Karachi.
The woman told police that the suspect held her minor daughter hostage, saying he would only let her go when she brought him another woman from Karachi.

They added that one-and-a-half-year-old Sudais along with his parents had come to the park on Feb 2 where he went missing.

Subsequently, the Preedy police registered a kidnap case against an unidentified couple, which was seen in the closed-circuit television camera footage taking the child away from the park.

A special team of the police led by Inspectors Atiq Rehman and Sajjad Khan carried out an intelligence-based operation in Kalapul late on Tuesday night and arrested the couple and recovered the child safely.

The officer added that the police during the raid also recovered another boy from the couple’s house, who was also seen in the CCTV footage.

The IGP Sindh and the city police chief announced reward and appreciation certificates for the police party.

A senior officer said that the held couple identified as Shahid and Rukhsana claimed that they had found the infant boy abandoned in the park and took him along.

But the officer said that they had the CCTV footage, which clearly showed that the couple had abducted the child apparently for some ulterior motives.

The investigators decided to conduct the other recovered boy’s DNA test to ascertain as to whether he had also been kidnapped. Apparently the boy had no resemblance with the couple.

The officer said that the couple might have kidnapped the children for begging or selling purposes.

""You (Nawaz) were elected by this country thrice and now you are going against it just because you want relief from your cases? You are blinded, you want to take revenge from the masses. You want to blackmail Pakistan and its institutions. This will not happen,"" Faraz said in a press conference.

The information minister further said that the PML-N supremo had not ""gotten along"" with any of the institutions.

""You want judges like Justice Qayum. You have never gotten along with any army chief, from [retired Gen] Janjua to now. This is what you do: you destablise democracy. You are responsible,"" Faraz declared and went on to say that the former prime minister was a ""product"" who came to power through the support of the establishment. The minister said that the incumbent government had a good relationship with the army because it was ""full of honest people"".

The PML-N leader, Faraz added, was criticising the chairperson of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), who was appointed by Nawaz himself.

""Now you have become a revolutionary, [acting] like you are statesman. You are accused of theft! You were not sent to jail because of any political dispute, [it was because] of the crimes you committed,"" the minister said.

The information minister went on to say that Nawaz ""started a narrative"" that had no connection to his cases. The PTI leader also said that Nawaz's government had devalued the currency so much that, were it not for the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan, the country would have ended up in the same situation like Venezuela ""where people take carts full of money to buy toothpaste"".

The information minister also cast doubt on the unity of the opposition parties that have formed the anti-government alliance named Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM). The alliance includes almost all major opposition parties that seek the government's ouster and has released its plan to launch nationwide protests and rallies. The first public meeting of the PDM will be held in Quetta on October 11.

PML-N is part of the alliance as well and the party's supremo — who is currently in London — virtually addressed the first meeting of the PDM, where he cast doubt over the conduct of the 2018 general elections and workings of the parliament.

""How many parties agree with Nawaz's point of view? They are already divided,"" Faraz said in today's press conference, adding that all politicians in the opposition wanted an NRO but Prime Minister Imran will never agree to give one. The federal minister said that the PTI had come to power with the promise to establish justice in the country and arrest politicians who were involved in corruption.

The minister also blamed previous governments, particularly that of PML-N, for expensive electricity and ruining the economy. He alleged that the Nawaz government had left the economy and the institutions ""hollow"".

'Grand alliance for corruption'

Separately, Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry, in a press conference in Karachi criticised PDM, saying that it had ""no moral and legal justification"" and termed it as the ""grand alliance for corruption"".

He said that PPP supporters were ""disappointed"" that the late Benazir Bhutto's party was working alongside Maulana Fazlur Rehman. He accused PPP of seeking help from ""extremist forces"" to continue its politics.

Chaudhry also expressed suspicions that Rehman was looking to use seminary students to launch protests against the government.

The minister said that the alliance has been speaking against the armed forces and the judiciary and was aiming to spread chaos in the country. At the same time, however, he said that the opposition alliance had ""no future"".","['Dawn.Com', 'Imtiaz Ali', 'M.

2244,1257,460,https://www.dawn.com/news/1550828,4/20/20 21:34,Sindh police turns focus on testing after 15 policemen diagnosed with Covid-19 in Karachi,"At least 15 police personnel have so far tested positive for the coronavirus in Karachi, prompting higher authorities to direct senior officers to get tests done of the infected policemen's family members and colleagues, officials and sources said on Monday.

The development comes as 156 of the 227 new coronavirus cases confirmed in Sindh on Monday were detected in Karachi, indicating a rise in local transmission of the virus.

Among the Covid-19 positive policemen are two inspectors and as many sub-inspectors while most of the remaining officials are either head constables or constables deputed at different places in the city.

Except one inspector who tested positive in March, all other policemen tested positive in the last 20 days, according to a list of infected police personnel obtained by Dawn.

Police sources said that one of the policemen who tested positive is a personal staff officer (PSO) to a deputy inspector general (DIG) while another is the driver of another DIG rank officer. Two other such policemen were posted at the offices of as many senior superintendents of police (SSP) in the city.

According to the sources, 22 family members of one Covid-19 positive policeman were tested for the virus, out of whom eight close relatives turned out to be positive. A colleague of an infected policeman also tested positive while the results of tests of several family members and colleagues of other positive policemen are awaited.

A senior officer said that all the infected policemen have been admitted to the isolation wards of different hospitals in the metropolis. Only one police officer was in serious condition who has since “slightly recovered” after treatment at a private hospital.

Meanwhile, Sindh Inspector General of Police Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar on Monday directed the DIGs and SSPs of all ranges, districts and units to ensure tests are carried out of the family members and colleagues of all policemen who test positive or those personnel whose test results are awaited.

An official notice issued by AIG Welfare Tauqeer Mohammed Naeem directed the DIGs and SSPs to send the reports of tests of police personnel and their families to a focal person appointed by them.

Interviews with police officials conducted by Dawn earlier this month had revealed that thousands of police personnel who were deployed to enforce the lockdown announced by the provincial government to control the spread of Covid-19 found themselves on the frontlines of the crisis without proper personal protective equipment (PPE) or training.

'Not an easy situation'

Also on Monday, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah revealed that 227 new Covid-19 cases emerged in the province during the last 24 hours after 1,600 tests were conducted. Five more people lost their lives from the disease, taking the provincial death toll to 61 in 33 days.

“Out of 227 new cases, 156 belong to Karachi and 71 to other divisions of the province but the local transmission [of the virus] has started wreaking havoc in the city,” Shah said, according to a statement issued by his office.

In a video message, the chief minister while highlighting the gravity of the situation said that 68 cases of local transmission were detected in Karachi's South district, 31 in Central, 65 in East, 23 Korangi, five West and four in Malir.

“This is not an easy situation, therefore, we will have to take some strict and proactive measures to contain it and stop its further spread,” Shah stressed.","['Imtiaz Ali', 'M.

During the launch of the report, Ansar Sajjad Bhatti, the provincial coordinator of Sahil, and Advocate Atif Khan gave some recommendations to monitor and counter child sex abuse.

They called for an effective awareness campaign by the government for protection of children from sexual abuse. New legislation must be introduced and implementation of enforced enactments must be ensured, they suggested and said that a comprehensive rehabilitation and support system for victims of abuse must also be formed while messages should be included in the school curriculum. They demanded a provincial plan of action against the sexual abuse and exploitation must also be formed immediate.

The PBC statement regretted that by resorting to such crude and illegal action even privacy of a female leader of the opposition had been violated which neither “our religion nor our culture, law and ethics permit”.","['bar', 'president', 'kidnapping', 'chairman', 'assails', 'regretted', 'vice', 'statement', 'sindh', 'ig', 'pbc', 'scba', 'reported']","{'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e27f8e222.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd308f345fbc.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd226020ad44.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/10/5f8fea424b3fb.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3096e45cfd.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0d46f397df.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2270f8f9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd18af1e7f94.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/10/5f8fea424b3fb.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd329902b790.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd3212f03b18.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f6cd00234.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/10/5f92585f1e465.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2f48fd4905.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e88067094.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff8f0a77c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e6aa76ba1.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd05faebf8c9.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2fada4de4b.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2ff724e900.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e324c5a51.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd03eec14c89.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1d3bb0c494.jpg?r=1465762107', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fd0aa84964d5.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd1e54120b6d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd30de07ff7e.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd32449b647f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/10/5f92585f1e465.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fd2e2cfc2a37.jpg'}",TRUE,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/10/5f92585f1e465.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': 'No categorical denial of the alleged kidnapping of the Sindh IG has been made by the authorities concerned, statement says.', 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1586574', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'PBC assails ‘kidnapping’ of Sindh police IG', 'description': 'No categorical denial of the alleged kidnapping of the Sindh IG has been made by the authorities concerned, statement says.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/10/5f92585f1e465.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1586574', 'title': 'PBC assails ‘kidnapping’ of Sindh police IG', 'description': 'No categorical denial of the alleged kidnapping of the Sindh IG has been made by the authorities concerned, statement says.', 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/10/5f92585f1e465.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-10-23 07:05:19', 'modified_time': '2020-10-23 09:16:39', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/397/the-newspaper-s-staff-reporter'}, 'author': ""The Newspaper's Staff Reporter""})",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dawn,,2020-10-23
2261,1274,555,https://www.dawn.com/news/1561065,6/3/20 17:11,189pc increase in cyber harassment complaints during lockdown: Digital Rights Foundation,"The Digital Rights Foundation has reported a 189 per cent increase in complaints registered with their Cyber Harassment Helpline during Pakistan's countrywide lockdown, enforced to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.

""As Pakistan entered its lockdown [in March] in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, we feared there would be an increase in cyber harassment cases as well as cyber attacks in general,"" a press release issued on Wednesday by the not-for-profit organisation said.

The organisation, which works to ensure ""digital freedoms"" in the country, reported a combined 136 complaints of cyber harassment in March and April — during the lockdown — compared to 47 such complaints, an increase of 189pc, before the lockdown in January and February.

Seventy four per cent of the complaints registered in March and April were reported by women, whereas, men and non-binary persons registered 19pc and 5pc complaints, respectively.

A majority of the cases that the organisation's cyber harassment helpline received during the lockdown months ""pertained to blackmailing through non-consensual sharing of information, intimate pictures and videos"".

Complaints of hate speech, phishing, fake profiles and defamation were also reported, according to the Digital Rights Foundation.

Women in Pakistan are victims of forms of gendered violence in the digital sphere that includes sexual harassment, surveillance, unauthorised use and dissemination of personal data, and manipulation of personal information, the organisation said.

Digital Rights Foundation also released a list of recommendations for policy makers and law enforcement.

""These [recommendations] cover issues of the Federal Investigation Agency's (FIA) accessibility especially during the pandemic, and also how technology needs to be used hand in hand while dealing with digital harassment cases, like allowing for video testimonies,"" it said.","['Dr. Salaria', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Mansur Ul Haque', 'B Gates', 'Images Staff', 'Asha Ar Rehman', 'Nikhat Sattar', 'Aasim Sajjad Akhtar', 'I.A.
