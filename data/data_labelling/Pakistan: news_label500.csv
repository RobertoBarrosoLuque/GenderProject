“We want exemplary punishment for the cleric, who had assaulted a seminary student and those who harboured him after this heinous crime,” Mohammad Shoaib, the former president of traders’ union, told the protesters who had gathered outside the Ghazikot Township here.

The protesters were holding banners and placards inscribed with slogans in support of their demands. They demanded the arrest of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) leader Mufti Kifayatullah who, according to them, had provided shelter to the suspect before his arrest in the assault case of a seminary student.

The children were also holding placards inscribed with a slogan ‘No mercy for child rapists’. Shoaib said that Wafaqul Madaras should not be blamed for such an inhuman act committed by some black sheep in that noble profession. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf local activist Adil Khan said that government should frame tough laws to award exemplary punishment in cases of child abuse. “We want public hanging of criminals, who assault minors and then kill them to hide their heinous crime,” he added.",['Our Correspondent'],"MANSEHRA: The members of civil society and children on Thursday staged a protest against the rising incidents of child abuse in Hazara Division and rest of the country.

Talking to this scribe before stepping in court, he said, “I am seriously thinking to develop a forum against women violence and killing in the name of honor. Soon I will announce a detailed charter against violence in consultation of close aides. There is a dire need to protect women from all types of violence.”

The counsel argued that police could produce mobile sets of Mufti Abdul Qavi on remand papers. He said that Mufti Abdul Qavi handed over those mobile sets voluntarily to police to check calls data instead police recovered from cleric during investigation.

Earlier, Mufti Abdul Qavi was produced before D&SJ court at new judicial complex aimed tight security. He was brought from Multan district jail. The court sent Mufti Abdul Qavi on judicial due to lack of submitting complete challans by police on Monday.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/399515-women-in-conflict-areas-the-case-of-kashmir,,Women in conflict areas: the case of Kashmir,"UN Women is all set to mark 16 days of activism against gender-based violence but unfortunately it has failed to include violence against women in conflict zones within this agenda. Yet this is a critical aspect of violence against women and its impact on family and societal structures.

Ironically, given the recent scandals that have emerged regarding abuse of women in conflict areas by UN peacekeepers, UN Women should have focused on gender-based violence in conflicts, especially unconventional conflicts involving state and non-state actors.

Conflict situations always create risks for women, particularly in the context of abuse and exploitation, both directly, where women are specifically targeted, and indirectly because conflict leads to a breakdown in the structure of the family. So conflicts, especially unconventional ones, destroy the core group of society – the family. And it can take decades after the conflict is over to recover from this destruction. Ever since the centre of gravity of wars – conventional and unconventional – shifted from the armed forces to civilian populations, women and children have become part of the targeting strategies. Yet in processes aimed at ending wars and resolving conflicts, women have been left out of the mainstream of stakeholders involved in peace making.

In October 2000, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1325 on “Women, Peace and Security”, which recognised the need to understand the consequences of armed conflict on women and girls so that institutional arrangements could be developed and strengthened to guarantee not only their safety but also the participation of women in the peace process. Of course, different regions of the world produce their own unique problems and needs relating to women in conflict areas. The ICRC, recognising this, stated in a report following UNSC Resolution 1325 that “the effect of war on women is not only determined by the character and stage of the conflict, but also by the particular role of each woman caught up in it”. In other words, “it is vital to respond to women’s particular needs – be they combatants, persons deprived of their freedom, refugees, IDPs, mothers and/or members of the civilian population”.

In Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK), women have been severely affected by the struggle against Indian occupation, but women have remained outside of the political dialogues so that their specific issues and concerns are denied the centrality they deserve. For instance, although Kashmiri women have become deliberate targets of the Indian security forces through the use of rape as a weapon of war, they are yet to come to the forefront as primary stakeholders in any discussion on conflict resolution.

The International Criminal Tribunals of Yugoslavia and Rwanda (ICTY and ICTR) first highlighted the concept of rape as a weapon of war, and rape has been systematically and persistently used by the Indian army against Kashmiri women. One reason why this has kept recurring is because of the culture of impunity that prevails. For instance, in May 1990, a young woman, Mubina Gani, was raped. An inquiry was conducted which found that the rape had indeed occurred but the officials responsible were never prosecuted. A few months later, in July 1990, a case was registered against Border Security Force officials for the rape of a 24-year old woman, Hasina. No investigation was carried out in this case, let alone prosecution.

Who can forget the horrific rape of a young girl in a temple in IOK by Indian security forces? Nor has it been just individual cases of rape by individual Indian security personnel. There were the two incidents of mass rape committed by Indian soldiers in the villages of Poshpora and Kunan in February 1991 when Indian security forces entered the villages and separated the men from the women before proceeding to rape the latter. Although the survivors have been fighting for justice in the Indian courts, so far justice has eluded them.

Such impunity is systemic as was highlighted in 2013 by Rashida Manjoo, the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, its Causes and Consequences. She noted how the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act 1990 granted special powers to the Indian security forces, which resulted in a lack of accountability and redress for victims of human rights violations. She especially emphasised how the Army Act 1950 “limits the scope for civil courts to consider allegations of violence against women perpetrated by army officials, including killings and sexual violence”.

However, women also suffer indirectly in conflict situations because, when the male breadwinner is no longer alive, female-headed households face innumerable challenges of survival, which impacts the education and health of the entire family. It is in this context that the issue of ‘enforced disappearances’ becomes critical – especially because there is no closure for the family. That is why when states move towards democracy from authoritarianism, not only must enforced disappearances end – for families to have closure – but some form of a truth and reconciliation commission must also be created to bring closure to families.

In fact enforced disappearances, especially where special draconian powers are given to the LEAs and the military, as has been the case in IOK, are also a major source of the victimisation and psychological torture of families (This issue requires a separate article or paper, which will soon be forthcoming in a wider context beyond Kashmir). Again, in Kashmir the issue of enforced disappearances has led to the creation of the term ‘half widows’ – women whose husbands have disappeared but have not been declared deceased. These ‘half widows’ tend to live impoverished lives, confronted with socio-economic and psychological uncertainties such as lack of property rights and the right to remarry.

However, if the Indian occupation security forces had calculated that the targeting of women would result in a loss of will on the part of the Kashmiris to continue their struggle for liberation from Indian Occupation and demand their right to self determination, their calculations could not have been more erroneous. Women in Kashmir have fought back against the violence perpetrated against them – since 2014, on every February 23, ‘Kashmiri Women’s Resistance Day’ is commemorated as this was the day on which the mass rape and torture of women was carried out after a large-scale military attack in the villages of Poshpora and Kunan.

Unfortunately, not enough attention is focused on the gender dimension of the violence being perpetrated by the Indian occupation forces in IOK. Issues of sexual violence, trafficking, enforced prostitution, children born as a consequence of sexual violence and suffering trauma and stigmatization – all these are the fallout from the human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian laws by the Indian state. Pakistan has failed to raise these issues in international organisations dealing specifically with women in conflict situations as it seeks international support for implementation of UNSC resolutions on Kashmir. As for the democratic world, for all its claims to upholding human rights values, it has been criminally silent on Indian atrocities in IOK, especially the use of rape as a deliberate weapon of war by Indian security forces.

Ironically, given the recent scandals that have emerged regarding abuse of women in conflict areas by UN peacekeepers, UN Women should have focused on gender-based violence in conflicts, especially unconventional conflicts involving state and non-state actors.
Of course, different regions of the world produce their own unique problems and needs relating to women in conflict areas.
Who can forget the horrific rape of a young girl in a temple in IOK by Indian security forces?

It was disclosed in the statistics compiled by Punjab Commission on the Status of Women from the data available with the Inspectorate General of Punjab Police, The News has learnt. Around 10,000 rape cases were reported in Punjab during the last three and a half years, from January 2014 to June 2017, in Punjab.

In 2015, 202 women were raped in Faisalabad, 160 in Rahimyar Khan and 151 in Lahore. The ratio of rape victims is higher in the cities where literacy rate is higher.

Thirteen women were raped in Attock, 150 in Bahwalnagar, 27 in Bhakkar, 7 in Chakwal, 39 in Chiniot, 83 in DG Khan, 102 in Gujranwala, 29 in Gujrat, 21 in Hafizabad, 88 in Jhang, 14 in Jhelum, 87 in Kasur, 117 in Khanewal, 20 in Khushab, 43 in Lyyah, 66 in Lodhran, 34 in Mandi Bahauddin, 140 in Multan, 144 in Muzaffargarh, 19 in Narowal, 114 in Okara, 147 in Pakpattan, 2 in Rajanpur, 38 in Rawalpindi, 70 in Shahiwal, 100 in Sargodha, 62 in Sheikhupura, 62 in Sialkot, 62 in Toba Tek Singh and 103 in Vehari.

In 2016, 248 women were raped in Faisalabad, 204 in Muzaffargarh 204 and 179 in Rahimyar Khan.

In 2016, more rape cases were observed in South Punjab where traditions are strong.

PCSW Chairperson Fauzia Viqar said that alarmingly the number of cases of rape had increased in Punjab. Unfortunately, the rate of conviction is only three percent in rape cases, she added. The criminals get released because of complicated investigation process. Police officials destroy the proofs of rape victims intentionally, she said. It is disgraceful that bribe is demanded from victim family too in the police stations, she said. Moreover, she said, police officials are not trained to collect evidence from rape scene.

They don’t know how to collect DNA sample. Collection of evidence is a science and policemen are not aware of it, PCSW chairperson stated. She was of the view, “Lacunas are in our criminal judicial system which need to be addressed. Judges are over burdened.

There is no security for witnesses. Even eye witnesses decline to testify in court and subsequently, criminals got advantage of it.”

According to her, police don’t behave nicely with the victim. She said criminals got released as the victims could not pursue the cases because they could not pay the heavy fee of lawyers.

PCSW is statutory body established by by the government of Punjab for the promotion of women’s rights. As part of its mandate, PCSW gathers data related to violence against women from the office of the Inspectorate General Police, Punjab. It is pertinent to mention here that it does not directly address VAW.

According to Dr Tahira Rubab Hafeez, consultant clinical psychologist, the incidents of rape are attached with revenge in the country. It has been observed in most of the cases that rapists already knew the victim of rape. According to her, in masculine society, the rapists take pride in rape.

Additionally, in feudal society, family disputes invoke the rapists. The people don’t have healthy activities. That is why they are involved in such kind of criminal activity.",['Sher Ali Khalti'],"Lahore :Faisalabad, Lahore, Muzaffargarh and Rahimyar Khan remained on the top of the list showing the number of women raped in Punjab in the last three and a half years.

Late on Friday, China´s finance ministry unveiled new sets of additional tariffs on 5,207 goods imported from the United States, with the extra levies ranging from five to 25 percent on a total value of goods less than half of that proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump´s administration.

The response follows the Trump administration´s proposal of a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.

""China´s countermeasures are rational,"" the Global Times, a tabloid run by the official People´s Daily, said in a commentary.

""China will not rush to compete with U.S. numbers,"" it said, echoing comments made by state television.

The United States and China implemented tariffs on $34 billion worth of each others´ goods in July.

Washington is expected to soon implement tariffs on an additional $16 billion of Chinese goods, which China has already said it will match immediately.

""The White House´s extreme pressure and blackmail are already clear to the international community,"" said a state television commentary. ""Such methods of extreme blackmail will not bear fruit against China.""

China has now either imposed or proposed tariffs on $110 billion in U.S. goods, representing the vast majority of China´s annual imports of American products.

Last year, China imported about $130 billion in goods from the United States.

""The U.S. has repeatedly resorted to threatening and deceitful routines, trying to force China to compromise, both overestimating its own bargaining power and underestimating China´s determination and ability to defend its national dignity and the interests of its people,"" said a commentary in the official Xinhua news agency.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, remained staunch on Washington´s push for fairer trading conditions with China.

""President Trump inherited an unfair trade regime where American workers and American companies were not treated reciprocally or fairly by the Chinese, and the efforts of the Trump administration are to right that, to correct that,"" Pompeo said to reporters on the sidelines of a regional forum in Singapore. Pompeo added that he had discussed trade issues with Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi on Friday.

Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said he met Pompeo in Singapore and that his message was clear.

""My objective was quite straightforward: I think I need to inform him that we are very concerned,"" said Saifuddin.

Countries like Malaysia form an integral part of Chinese exporters´ supply chains, and analysts have warned a trade war could knock billions of dollars off their economic growth in coming years.

""China has taken a necessary and legitimate response, based on the interests of the Chinese people and to protect the rules-based international trade system under the WTO,"" said Wang on the sidelines of the Singapore forum on Saturday.

In response to a question about a comment by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow that China´s latest measures are ""weak"", Wang said: ""Does he want China to take an even stronger response?""",[],"BEIJING/SINGAPORE: China´s state media said on Saturday the government´s retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods showed rational restraint and they accused the United States of blackmail.

The latest example was the ‘ridiculous’ dialogues between the governments and the private transporters. One can only express shock and dismay as to how these people can so blatantly challenge and violate the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) put into force by the federal and provincial governments if they want to start their operations!

On one hand, these transporters had been protesting and pleading, against and to, the government to let them resume their business.

They always cried for special compensation/relief packages to mitigate the losses they had suffered because of being pushed out of business following the imposition of ‘lockdown’ by the government to prevent spread of COVID-19 pandemic.

Each time any of these businessmen, be those the ‘Shadi Hall/Marque’ operators, transporters, Shopping Mall owners, entertainment industry operators, small and mid-level industrialists talked about the losses they have suffered, the amount was always mentioned in billions!

One wonders if the amount of losses they claimed they have suffered, would this not be a golden opportunity for the government or the FBR or any other relevant departments to take them on their words and sift through records as to how much income tax and other taxes they are supposed to pay have been paid by them in the past?

The amounts of losses these people are pushing forward they have suffered over a period of two or three months are fabulous, none mentioning losses less then billions of rupees!

Whomsoever the government tries to follow the laws and rules, they instantly go on strike, making the government to bow eventually. Just like the flour mill owners did a few days back.

However, right now it is the transporters who are openly challenging the writ of the federal and provincial governments for following the SOPs! They are not ready to reduce the number of passengers they will be carrying in their vehicles.

They have refused to scale down the fares despite the fact that the POL prices have gone down considerably low. They are openly over-charging from the passengers who are stranded in different cities and towns all over the country and are desperate to go to their homes to celebrate Eid with their families.",['Mobarik A.

Trocaire, Irish international organisation, with the support of the Australian Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade, last year launched a media advocacy campaign on the issues around gender based violence in Pakistan. The PurAzm campaign, titled ‘Gender equality – Our commitment’, is a call to youth, men and women to reaffirm their commitment to promote gender equality and challenge gender based violence.

The second phase of the PurAzm campaign envisions building on the work done thus far and identifying new partnerships to further effectively disseminate the message of “Gender Equality, Our Commitment.”

The second phase of campaign was launched with an inspiring “Balloon Raising Ceremony” which gave the participants an opportunity to sign “commitment cards” hanging at the ends of the balloons and reaffirm their commitment to gender equality and challenging gender based violence.

The balloons were released simultaneously in to the blue sky and symbolized the hopes and aspirations of the women of Pakistan and their quest for equality. The dramatic visual display of white balloons flowing freely in to the sky inspired the audience to make a renewed commitment to the cause of women and girls right.

“We celebrate the progressive legislative measures taken in Punjab and KP but we recognize the fact that violence against women and girls remains a serious and unacceptable reality in Pakistan,” said Country Director Trocaire in Pakistan John O’Brien.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/756235-orange-the-world,,Orange the world,"Violence against women is rampant not only in Pakistan but around the world in various forms, be it domestic violence and abuse, sexual abuse and harassment, forced marriage, child marriage, human trafficking, cyber-bullying, acid attacks, female genital mutilation, etc. In fact, women face physical, psychological, and sexual violence in every sphere of life, whether they are at the workplace or on the street or in the market.

The ‘In-Depth Study on All Forms of Violence against Women: Report of the Secretary-General, 2006’, mandated by General Assembly resolution 58/185, states that “Violence against women is one of the most pervasive human rights violations. It devastates lives, fractures communities, and stalls development. At least one out of every three women around the world has been beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime – with the abuser usually someone known to her.”

It is a sad fact that gender-based violence whether in the home or the community is rooted in the global culture of gender inequality and discrimination, which not only violates the fundamental human rights of women and girls but also allows violence to occur with impunity. It is used as a tool to keep them under control.

Acceptance of violence as a social norm is also responsible for increasing incidents of violence against women. It is said that men who grow up seeing violence being perpetrated accept it as the norm and often resort to violence. But women now are not ready to accept it and are beginning to speak up. A scene in a Pakistani drama Kankar, aired some years back attempted to explain this possible root cause of marital abuse, where the young wife who is physically abused by her husband openly tells her mother-in-law that it is her fault as she silently accepted violence at the hands of her husband.

However, we need to understand that violence against women is not inevitable, but preventable. To end this cycle of violence, it is essential to change the attitudes that perpetuate, rationalise, and normalise violence, and deny women their right to safe living. Since men are overwhelmingly the perpetrators of gender-based violence, their attitude needs to be changed.

It is heartening to know that the world has not accepted the situation and a lot is being done to raise awareness about violence against women and to mobilise efforts to end such practices. Women’s rights organisations have been, for long, raising their voices against women’s rights abuses. Though countries are taking measures to prevent such crimes, it is a global problem and requires global action.

And action is indeed being taken. On the one hand, there are legislations and UN conventions that call for action to curb violence against women, and on the other, there are awareness campaigns such as 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence that seeks to inspire action to end all forms of violence against women. The Campaign was launched in 1991 by the Centre for Women’s Global Leadership (CWGL) at its first Women’s Global Leadership Institute in 1991 and is used as an organising strategy by individuals and organisations around the world to call for the prevention and elimination of gender-based violence (GBV).

The campaign runs between Nov 25 and Dec 10 every year; the dates chosen are significant as the starting day is the International Day of Elimination of Violence Against Women, and the concluding day is the International Human Rights Day. The dates symbolically link violence against women and human rights and emphasises that such violence is a violation of human rights.

Campaigns such as this one highlight the issue, and create public awareness about the need to bring about changes to prevent it from happening at the local, national, regional, and global levels.

While Pakistan has made some progress in the right direction as several women-friendly laws have been passed by parliament that deal with various forms of gender-based violence including honour killing, rape, sexual harassment, acid attacks, forced marriage, etc a lot more needs to be done as the laws are not properly implemented and women are still subjected to discrimination and violence. The lower status of women in our society is also contributing to gender-based violence.

In light of the increasing cases of sexual abuse in the country, and public demand for legislation, the Cabinet Committee on Disposal of Legislative Cases has approved two anti-rape ordinances aimed at setting up special courts for sexual offences against women and children and introducing harsher punishments for convicts. According to reports, the two ordinances – the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Ordinance, 2020 and the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 – provide mechanisms in the investigation and punishment of rape and sexual abuse against women and children. After final approval from the cabinet, they will be sent to the president to be promulgated and must be submitted to parliament for ratification within 90 days after being promulgated.

We have hope that something is being done to curb crimes of the worst nature against women and children. At the same time, care should be taken that the legislation does not remain on paper but is implemented in letter and spirit. At the same time, tighter implementation of other pro-women bills is the need of the hour to enable women the space they deserve in society. However, for results to show, awareness and a change in attitude is essential.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/110054-Erdogan-says-Obama-spoke-behind-my-back-on-press-freedom,,Erdogan says Obama spoke ´behind my back´ on press freedom,"ISTANBUL: Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan accused US counterpart Barack Obama of going behind his back for criticising Turkey´s press freedom record and linked it to efforts to ""divide"" Turkey, media reports said on Sunday.

Obama said on Friday after meeting Erdogan on the sidelines of a nuclear summit in Washington that he was troubled by curbs on the press in Turkey and said he had urged Erdogan not to repress democratic debate in his country.

Turkey has drawn international condemnation for charging two journalists with treason for publishing footage that purportedly showed the intelligence agency shipping truckloads of weapons to opposition fighters in Syria in early 2014. Can Dundar and Erdem Gul of Cumhuriyet face life in prison.

""I was saddened to hear that statement made behind my back. During my talk with Obama, those issues did not come up,"" Erdogan told reporters, according to Hurriyet daily.

He returned to Turkey after a five-day trip to Washington on Sunday.

""You cannot consider insults and threats press freedom or criticism,"" Erdogan said.

Turkey has seized control of opposition newspapers and TV channels and cut the satellite feed of a pro-Kurdish channel, accusing them of terrorism-related activities.

Erdogan has personally brought more than 1,800 criminal suits against individuals, including journalists and children, for insulting him since becoming president in 2014. The Committee to Protect Journalists said at least 13 journalists are in jail for their coverage and described a ""massive crackdown"" that includes self-censorship and harrassment of media-business owners.

‘MASTERMIND’

Criticism of Turkey´s press record seeks to ""divide, shatter and if they could, swallow up Turkey,"" he said.

""This is what I mean by mastermind. A mastermind is playing games over Turkey.

Erdogan and his supporters occassionally refer to a shadowy foreign ""mastermind"" that seeks to destabilise Turkey, a NATO member that shares borders with Syria, Iraq and Iran.

Separately, Erdogan said the US and Turkey had edged closer in their stances on Syrian Kurds, close US allies in the fight against Islamic State.

Turkey sees the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and its political arm, the PYD, as part of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency against Turkey.

US officials have said they distinguish between the groups.

Both Vice President Joseph Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry promised Erdogan during meetings they would not allow the formation of a PYD-run state in Syria, the Turkish leader said.

Turkey is putting forth the names of 2,400 trained Arab and Turkmen fighters to battle Islamic State, Erdogan also said, describing them as part of the moderate opposition.

This was ""so the US no longer has an excuse"" for co-operating with the YPG and PYD, he said.",[],"ISTANBUL: Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan accused US counterpart Barack Obama of going behind his back for criticising Turkey´s press freedom record and linked it to efforts to ""divide"" Turkey, media reports said on Sunday.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/244591-The-Buffalo-Boy,,‘The Buffalo Boy’,"Islamabad :Director: Minh Nguyen-Vo ‘The Buffalo Boy’ from Vietnam screened at Mandwa Film Club, Lok Virsa.

Vietnam does not carry the baggage of mediocrity in film making. After the successful struggle of independence and freedom, it has made few films but made its mark on low-budget realistic films, largely filmed on locations with shoestring budgets and co productions. This cinema is free from false and meaningless production effects which now include computer effects and almost always meticulous colour corrections and digital sound attractions during post-production. A French-Vietnam co production, it was filmed in southern province of Vietnam and it is the reality which strikes us first here. Our central character, a boy of fifteens (on screen he looks much elder), is coming of age.

The time is around 1940, the French are leaving and Japanese are entering the field . The boy and his family are under stress: debt, disaster and death. The rural Vietnam at this point is least bothered as to who governs and from where.

Independent life is what youth want. Livestock (in this case buffalo) is what matter most. Livestock is everything for survival. The village has rainy season for six months where even burial takes place under water. Death of livestock is death of life here. Without disclosing the plot details, ‘The Buffalo Boy’ is a charming film with gorgeous locations.

The Director Minh Nguven-Vo holds a Doctorate in Sciences from UCLA (University of California) Los Angeles. He later studied film through extension programme of the University, and it was here where he completed screenplay for ‘The Buffalo Boy’, based on short stories. With a budget of less than one million dollars, the entire project was filmed on location during the flood season.

‘The Buffalo Boy’ is a tribute alone to human struggle for existence. The film was Vietnam's official submission for Academy Awards (Oscar) in 2006.

PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Friday reprimanded the federal government and claimed that it ""loved"" quoting the Human Rights Watch (HRW) on the Kashmir issue but not on the country's internal human rights abuses.

The PPP leader’s statement came in light of the recent report of the Human Rights Watch on human rights abuses allegedly being carried out by the National Accountability Bureau.

“Human rights watch calls out NAB political victimisation of political parties & media. Mentions Saad Rafique, Mir Shakeel-ur-Rehman, myself & my father. We love to quote @hrw on Kashmir but ignore them on Pakistan,” he wrote on Twitter.



HRW asks Pakistan to stop NAB abuses

Earlier, the HRW had urged the Pakistani authorities to stop using NAB —referring to it as ""a dictatorship-era body, possessing draconian and arbitrary powers"" — to harass and intimidate opponents.

In a statement, the rights organisation said that the government should follow up on the 87-page detailed verdict of the Supreme Court of Pakistan on the Khawaja brothers case to rein in the anti-graft body.

""The court granted the men bail and criticised the NAB for showing 'utter disregard to the law, fair play, equity and propriety,' ruling that the 'case was a classic example of trampling of fundamental rights [and] unlawful deprivation of freedom',"" read a statement from the HRW.

Pakistan’s parliament should carry out urgent reforms to make the anti-corruption body independent, the Human Rights Watch said.

""In its decision, the Supreme Court also expressed concern about the use of the NAB as an instrument to target government opponents,"" read the statement by the HRW. ""The court cited a February report by the European Commission that criticized the NAB for bias, noting that 'very few cases of the ruling party ministers and politicians have been pursued since the 2018 elections, which is considered to be a reflection of NAB's partiality,'"" it added.

HRW on MSR

The HRW mentioned the illegal arrest and detention of veteran journalist Mir Shakil-ur-Rehman by NAB, who is in the anti-graft body's custody since March.

""The National Accountability Bureau arrested Mir Shakil-ur-Rehman, editor-in-chief of the Jang group, the largest media group in Pakistan, in Lahore on March 12 on charges relating to a 34-year-old property transaction. He has remained in the agency’s custody ever since,"" said the human rights organisation.

The international NGO spoke of former president Asif Ali Zardari, who had to appear in person after the anti-graft body denied his request to record a statement through a video link because of his ill-health and the prevalent COVID-19 situation in the country.

""Zardari previously spent 11 years in prison – more than half in NAB custody – without a conviction,"" it said.",[],"Bilawal’s statement came in light of the recent report of the Human Rights Watch on human rights abuses allegedly being carried out by NAB.

The official said the human rights situation in the country was far from being satisfactory mostly due to poverty, ignorance, intolerance, corruption, weak political institutions and lack of good governance.","['relevant', 'taking', 'official', 'steps', 'human', 'necessary', 'ministry', 'marriages', 'rights', 'curriculum', 'provincial']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/700X390_thenews.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'Human rights to be part of curriculum | Islamabad | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'Islamabad: The Federal Ministry of Human Rights has planned the introduction of the subject of human rights in curriculum.\r\nFor the purpose, it is currently in contact with the relevant provincial...', 'keywords': 'human,rights,part,curriculum', 'fb': {'app_id': 650123461797330}, 'og': {'title': 'Human rights to be part of curriculum', 'image': {'identifier': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'secure_url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'width': 390}, 'description': 'Islamabad: The Federal Ministry of Human Rights has planned the introduction of the subject of human rights in curriculum.\r\nFor the purpose, it is currently in contact with the relevant provincial...', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/151612-Human-rights-to-be-part-of-curriculum', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@thenews_intl', 'creator': '@OCour correspondents', 'title': 'Human rights to be part of curriculum', 'description': 'Islamabad: The Federal Ministry of Human Rights has planned the introduction of the subject of human rights in curriculum.\r\nFor the purpose, it is currently in contact with the relevant provincial...', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg?t=020149'}, 'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style': 'black-translucent', 'apple-mobile-web-app-title': 'The News International', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#333333', 'theme-color': '#000000'})",[],news

ag INP

GUJRAT: A district court Friday acquitted all those named in the murder of Pakistani-origin Italian citizen Sana Cheema.

Judge Amir Mukhtar Gondal ordered the release of Sana’s father Ghulam Mustafa Cheema, uncle Mazhar Cheema and brother Adnan after 11 months of trial on the benefit of the doubt.

In April 2018, Sana story surfaced after an Italian publication claimed that she had been murdered for ‘honour’ in Pakistan.

The 26-year-old woman was killed in her hometown of Mangowal. She reportedly wanted to marry a man of her own will. Later an autopsy report revealed that the Pakistani-origin Italian girl was strangled.

Police soon arrested Sana’s father, uncle and brother in line with the document’s findings.

During the murder case probe, they revealed that the girl’s father and brother had confessed to their crime in the name of ‘honour’.

Sana’s relatives had earlier claimed she died a natural death. Her parents also submitted forged documents to the Italian embassy. Their assertion was corroborated by medical records detailing her protracted illness and treatment history.

A private hospital denied having admitted the woman over the course of a probe into her death saying Sana had visited the hospital on April 11 and left after being prescribed medicine for nausea.",[],"Accused father, brother, uncle acquittedag INPGUJRAT: A district court Friday acquitted all those named in the murder of Pakistani-origin Italian citizen Sana Cheema.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/158156-the-sorry-story-of-political-blackmail-of-a-72-year-old-lady,,The sorry story of political blackmail of a 72-year old lady,"ISLAMABAD: The chairman of a Senate standing committee has been almost caught red-handed while trying to deprive a 72-year-old lady of her only but expensive F-7 bungalow in Islamabad and the story of the legal and physical abuse and torture depicts the plight of all those citizens who are victims of the powerful political elite of this country.



In this gory drama of illegal misuse of power, outright fraud, cheating and use of blackmail and physical force, The News talked to all the parties concerned, met them several times, saw the documents they provided, some of which turned out to be fake later, and found that the old lady and her 90-year-old husband had become victims of brute political influence.



Senator Talha Mahmood Aryan, Chairman Senate Standing Committee on Interior, a ruling-JUI-F senator, has been occupying the house of the old woman in a posh Sector F-7 of Islamabad for the last seven years and not ready to vacate it despite high court and lower court’s verdicts while the whole Islamabad Police is openly siding with the chairman of the Senate interior committee.



Senator Talha, when approached by The News, provided some documents for proving the legality of his occupation of the house. However, all these documents given by Talha to this correspondent proved fake. When the documents provided by Talha to The News were found fake, a close friend of Talha, associated with the issue, approached this scribe and asked to mediate and close the issue.



Adviser on Interior Rehman Malik, when approached by The News and asked about the failure of the police to get the house vacated from illegal occupation of Chairman Senate Standing Committee on Interior despite higher court’s orders, said: “First, I have no knowledge of anything regarding Talha’s story. Secondly, I could only be held responsible for anything if the woman who is owner of the house visited my office and I did not help her in getting justice.”

to official website of the Senate of Pakistan, Muhammad Talha Mahmood Aryan is resident of House No.13-A, St-61, F-7/4, Islamabad. According to documentary evidences available with The News, Talha has taken this house on rent from its owner Ms Bilqees Israr in Feb 2002. According to contract signed by both the parties, the contract was for a period of four years while the rent was decided at the rate of Rs 25000/- per month. A clause of the agreement says that if the owner (Bilqees) wanted to vacate the house, she will have to serve a one-month notice. According to Bilqees, one of her sons returned to Pakistan after completing his specialization from Ireland and needed a residence in Islamabad, so she served a vacation notice on Talha Mahmood in 2003.



According to documentary evidence, Talha, instead of vacating the house, went to the court of civil judge from where the case was transferred to the court of Rent Controller/Civil Judge. Talha, according to Bilqees, presented a tampered agreement in the court, which shows that agreement was for a period of twenty years, with the rent Rs 25,000/- per month, which could be increased by 10% only after every five years. The court of Civil Judge/Rent Controller decided in favour of Bilqees Israr on the basis of Talha’s default and breaching the agreement and ordered him (Talha) to immediately vacate the house.



Talha, again instead of vacating the house approached District Judge where the decision was made in his favour. On this, Ms Bilqees approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and pleaded for the vacation of her house, which she had rented out for four years and was trying to get it vacated for the last seven years.



The IHC on Sep 9, 2008, decided the matter in favour of Bilqees, declared Senator Talha as defaulter and restored the verdict passed by the Rent Controller ordering Senator Talha Mahmood to immediately vacate the house. When Senator Talha didn’t vacate the house despite the IHC orders, a bailiff of IHC raided H-13-A on Nov 27th but was unable to get the house vacated. Later, the bailiff was to come back on December 18th but the Islamabad Police refused to provide force for the purpose.



On the court’s intervention, the bailiff was sent again and raided the house on January 21 2009, but at the time Senator Talha was fully prepared and according to Adil, son of Ms Bilqees, 15 to 20 armed gunmen were present there who practically pushed the police out of the house and threatened Adil with death if he dared to visit the house again. Adil has the photographs of the whole episode with Talha present at the scene and ordering his gunmen.



When Senator Talha was approached by this correspondent on his cell, he narrated a new story. He said he had entered a new rent-contract with Ms Bilqees and had paid her Rs1.8 million and that one son of Ms Bilqees was having a dispute with his mother and wanted to get the property. “Bilqees wants to rent out her home while her son does not,” Talha told The News.



When the same was conveyed to 72-year- old Ms Bilqees, she reached the offices of The News in 20 minutes with her 90-year-old husband and her two sons. The whole family stated on oath that they never had any dispute on property issue and that Senator Talha was making up such statements, which he had also done before the courts. These statements are completely untrue. Ms Bilqees said that she had not signed any new agreement with Senator Talha and had not received any money from Talha. “Rather, I am trying to get my house vacated under the court’s ruling and last raid of court’ bailiff was made on Jan 21st just two days back,” she reminded this correspondent.



When Talha was called again and was told about Ms Bilqees and her family’s presence in The News office, he invited this correspondent at his home (H#13-A, Street-61, F-7/4) to see some fresh documents. When this scribe visited the house in question, even at that time more than 15 guards were present outside the gate of the house.



During the meeting, Talha introduced this scribe to a new man Syed Waheed Hussain Sabzwari and said: “In fact, after the IHC decision I have accepted the court’s ruling and was ready to vacate the house. But, one of my damages claim petition was pending before the court. I have claimed damages of Rs 6.5 million from Ms Bilqees, which include Rs 1.5m for development works in the house and Rs5m for the mental torture I faced during the whole episode.



“After the IHC verdict on December 3rd we (Ms Bilqees, Senator Talha and Syed Waheed Hussain) have entered into a compromise pact according to which, I have withdrawn my damages claim of Rs 5 million and Ms Bilqees has agreed to pay my expenses of Rs 1,533,575. Ms Bilqees has rented out her home to Syed Waheed Shah for five years on a rent of Rs. 30,000 per month. Total amount of rent for five years (Rs.1,800,000 was paid in advance by Syed Waheed Shah in a way that he (Waheed) paid me (Talha) Rs1,533,575 and the rest Rs 266,425 was paid to Ms Bilqees.”



Talha provided The News with three documents; a compromise statement between three parties, a lease agreement between Ms Bilqees and Syed Waheed Hussain, and a copy of check of account of Syed Waheed Hussain issued in the name of Ms Bilqees Israr amounting to Rs 266,425/-. Talha said that he no more had possession of the house for the last one and an half months as Ms Bilqees had entered into a contract with Syed Waheed Hussain, though while making this statement Talha was sitting in the same house with whole of his office staff. Syed Waheed is the owner of Web Com, a cable network, which operates in Islamabad.



On returning to the office, when Ms Bilqees was asked about her agreement with Syed Waheed Hussain, she denied even seeing or meeting any person with that name in her whole life. At this when the agreement was shown to her, she was shocked as even her signatures were there which she claimed were faked. She said that she never entered into any compromise agreement with any third party on December 3 as mentioned in the documents given and was regularly visiting the courts throughout the month of December, 2008 and January, 2009 in her bid to vacate her house and under which courts’ bailiffs were formed on December 18th and January 21st.



She said she had offers of rent of Rs 150,000 per month for the house, how can she go for any compromise after winning the case and on a rent of rupees 30,000 per month. “I have lost all hopes after fighting this long battle and facing such questions but do I look mad to you that I will rent out my house situated in F-7 Sector of Islamabad for merely Rs 30,000 when I have offers of Rs150,000 per month for the same house.” On the question of Rs1,533,575/- development work done by Talha in her house, she disclosed that Talha had provided her with bills of different things purchased for the house which include furniture, computers and air conditioners and some of these bills were bearing the date which was even before of our first-ever rent agreement.



When The News contacted three different property dealers operating in the area, it was known that the market rate of rent for a house like in question (580 yards, a little more than one Kanal with three bedrooms in a two-storey house) in Sector F-7, vary from Rs120,000/- to 150,000/ at least.



The other document provided by Talha was a cheque from Syed Waheed Hussain in the name of Talha amounting Rs1,533,575 bearing date of December 1, while the compromise agreement was reached on December 3, 2008. During her meeting with The News on Friday, January 23, Ms Bilqees denied receiving any amount of Rs 266,425 from Syed Waheed. She, however, contacted The News on Saturday and said that on contacting her bank she came to know that a deposit of Rs266,425 had been made in her account on December 19. She said that her account number was available with Senator Talha, and the amount was transferred in her account without her knowledge.



She said she had moved an application in the bank to reverse the amount in the account of the person who deposited it in her account without her permission with the aim of occupying her house. Ms Bilqees provided The News a letter of the HSBC Bank saying that the bank shall revert the amount in the account of person who deposited it without the will of the account holder as soon as possible.



The climax of the story came when Syed Waheed visited The News office on Saturday. On being questioned about the fake compromise agreement and the new rent agreement documents, he conceded that if the rent was less he and Senator Talha were ready to raise the rent. He said that he was even ready to purchase the house if Ms Bilqees wanted to sell it. Waheed admitted that he was in great tension because of the situation and asked this scribe to mediate between the parties to get him out of the issue. He said that when he invested for the house he was not in picture of the complication and the background situation of the issue. It appeared that the poor guy was worried that he had paid Rs1.5 million to the Senator and Rs266,425 to the lady and the amount may be lost.



Senior Civil Judge Islamabad issued the latest orders on January 23 to concerned Kohsar Police Station SHO to get the house vacated. However, when Ashraf Shah, SHO Kohsar Police Station Islamabad, was contacted to know that why he was not taking action for vacation of the house said he was not responsible for vacation of house. His duty is to provide force to the bailiff and the whole responsibility lies with bailiff.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/439329-a-woman-who-speaks-up-for-herself-should-be-appreciated,,‘A woman who speaks up for herself should be appreciated’,"A Karachi Literature Festival session titled ‘Dangerous Women in Dangerous Times’ started off on Saturday with a question: why strong women are called dangerous women.

Literary greats, feminists and people from all walks of life gathered in Room 007 of the Beach Luxury Hotel on the second day of the 10th KLF and the topic was discussed by only one speaker, as airports across Pakistan were partially shut down due to the ongoing tension between Pakistan and India, making it impossible for panelists and speakers to make it to the venue.

Anita M Weiss, a sociologist and a professor of International Studies at the University of Oregon, USA, said dangerous time for a woman could be any moment of being forced to quit studies, a forced marriage, not letting a girl pursue her career or maybe a woman raising her children as a single parent.

She said it seemed to her that the number one characteristic that identified a dangerous woman was one being vocal about her rights during these dangerous times. Whenever a woman does something for herself, there starts objections and criticism, she said.

“Standing up to her own family against forced marriage or saying no to something is all it takes to be a dangerous woman.’’

“Everyone seems uncomfortable instead of appreciating these women. But then, what to do? Certainly not give up. If you are confident that you have a good idea, then you have to work to make the best of it,” Weiss said.

Bismah Aftab, a girl in the audience, shared her struggle of being the only girl among 70 boys in the field of electrical engineering.

“My family and everyone around me warned me when I was choosing this field, and they all said that this field is for boys and not girls. That day, I unheard people and I stood up for my choice, and today I am proudly working as an electrical engineering.”

Nimrah Akram shared a story of her domestic helper, Wajida, who is also a single parent, and how she proved herself to be a “dangerous woman” after being divorced by her husband. Wajida was giving the best possible education to her three daughters by working as a domestic helper and she was a satisfied mother.

Prof Weiss said the women were discouraged all over the world. “It is not only Pakistan but women are discouraged all over the world, especially dangerous women. This idea of rejecting women is now declining due to the feminist movement, but we all have to work together to make this world a better place for human beings, regardless of what the gender is.”

She concluded the session by saying: “Any woman who speaks up and stands out should be appreciated and not discouraged to slowly change the dangerous women’s label to strong women.”",['Saba Habib'],"A Karachi Literature Festival session titled ‘Dangerous Women in Dangerous Times’ started off on Saturday with a question: why strong women are called dangerous women.

As many as 32 sessions were held on the second day of the festival. People showed keen interest in every session. The LLF provided an opportunity to people to attend the sessions of their interests.

A large number of men and women attended the session titled “A Woman Like Her.” Sanam Maher discussed the aspects of the life of Qandeel Baloch who was killed by her brother in the name of socalled honour. On the occasion, Amar Sindhu, a Sindhi poet and activist, said Qandeel was killed because she had crossed the limitats determined by the male-dominated society. Woman is a daughter, wife, mother and friend.

She has many roles n her life. Qandeel exposed the typical mindset of men, he said. “The story of Qandeel is a story of every woman in our country; it does not matter to what class she belongs,” Amar said. In the session, honour killings were discussed in detail. In all cases of honour killings, families of the victims are responsible, said Ammara Athar, a police officer posted in Bahwalnagar. She said, “In my career, the first honour killing case was in Lahore and the entire family was saying she killed herself. How vulnerable is a girl in her house that she doesn't know her own brother is plotting hermurder,” said Ammara Athar. In a session “War Writing, Syria: Unraveling of a Cultural Haven in the Middle East, Rania Abuuzeid, Lalage Snow, Osama bin Javaid and Secunder Kermani discussed the critical situation of Syria and said it was difficult to confirm the stories. In Syria, IS/Daesh is a great threat, said the panellists of the session. According to them, refugees from the war-torn country migrated to Turkey and Lebanon. Around 5 million people were killed and no one could stop the killers.

The panellists said the situation was very tense in Syria. ""I'm not an adrenaline junkie; I don't even considermyself a war reporter. I covered the Middle East and the parts that happened to fall into the conflict,"" said award-winning journalist Rania Abouzeid. Actors Iqra Aziz and Atiqa Odho discussed the perceived misogyny in Pakistani drama serials.

Historian Ayesha Jalal discussed Kashmir alongside Anam Zakaria, who recently published a book with the interviews of the residents of Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Iqra Aziz said, ""We need to change the attitude that only a woman who leaves the house and works is a strong woman as there are also strong women in homes.” She talked about her own mother who worked hard in salons and became the first cab captain. Atiqa Odho said, ""Majority of the media houses are owned by men. I grew up with five sisters and we're all career women who don't have time to do all these conspiracies. There is a need to change the content to reflect us. We need to tell our own stories.”

Award-winning essayist Pankaj Mishra discussed his book The Age of Anger with author Mohsin Hamid. Royal Library Curator Emily Hannam and noted literary historian Francesca Orsini discussed the Padshanama, a manuscript of some of the most famous Mughal paintings ever created. At the end, a performance by Spanish guitarist Raul Viela was presented.",['Sher Ali Khalti'],"LAHORE: PEOPLE having literary taste from across the country attended the second day events of the seventh Lahore Literary Festival (LLF) on Saturday.

In a country established for Islam, the rulers had thrust a system based on tyranny and exploitation, exactly opposite to the message of Karbala which was to fight against oppression and tyranny, he said while delivering Friday sermon at Mansoora Masjid.

Siraj-ul-Haq said the passage of a so-called Honour Killing Bill by the joint session of the parliament in conflict with Quran and Sunnah proved that the ruling party was out to demolish the ideological boundaries of the country. He said denying the right of compromise to the parties in the cases of honour killings was repugnant to divine injunctions, and added that any law in conflict with the Shariah would not be tolerated.

He said the controversial Bill should have been referred to the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) for advice and deplored that a suggestion to this by the JI and other parties had not been accepted. He said the Bill had challenged the position of CII. He said the Constitution did not permit such a law and the ruling party and PPP should have respected the Constitution.

He said the message of Imam Hussain (RA) to the Ummah was not to yield before tyranny and injustice. Therefore, he said, all those who loved Imam Hussain (RA) would have to stand against tyranny. He said Imam Hussain never desired power. Instead, his struggle was for the rule of Holy Quran and Sunnah and he sacrificed his entire family for this great cause. Imam Hussain’s everlasting message to the believers was not to bow before tyranny and not refrain from laying down one’s life for the revival and survival of the Shariah system.

Siraj-ul-Haq pointed out that PPP’s founder ZA Bhutto had never imposed his socialist ideology on the country in respect of the sentiments of the nation and the PPP should follow the tradition set by its founder and not become a party to any legislation repugnant to Holy Quran and Sunnah.",[],"Siraj-ul-Haq said the passage of a so-called Honour Killing Bill by the joint session of the parliament in conflict with Quran and Sunnah proved that the ruling party was out to demolish the ideological boundaries of the country.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/495122-girl-falls-prey-to-honour-killing-in-swabi,,Girl falls prey to ‘honour killing’ in Swabi,"PESHAWAR: Newly-married Zoha, 18, was allegedly poisoned to death by her in-laws in Gandaf village in district Swabi on June 28.

After registering an initial report, the police are still waiting for the postmortem report to formally launch investigation into the case and arrest the suspects. The parents of Zoha have nominated her mother-in-law Khatun Bibi and her brother-in-law Mohsin Khan as the main suspects.

Zoha was married to Shahbaz Khan six months ago. Shahbaz Khan is currently doing his business in the US.

Zoha was probably dreaming big in a small village that pitched her against her in-laws who were opposed to her going to the US with her husband. Shahbaz Khan was supposed to take her to the US after a few days.

Zoha’s mother-in-law was said to be unwilling to send her to a foreign country and allegedly used to torture her as her husband was away. Soon after marriage, Khatun Bibi kept torturing Zoha — sometime beating her up or accusing her of having relations with someone. “But Zoha persevered against all odds hoping she will be soon with her husband in the US,” Zoha’s father, Riaz Khan, told The News.

Zoha’s elder sister Aman, wife of Mohsin Khan, is also married in the same family. According to Aman, Zoha kept screaming with pain pleading her in-laws to take her to a hospital, but her mother-in-law had her locked in her room, saying it is just low blood pressure and nothing serious. “Our mother-in-law even snatched my mobile phone so that I do not inform my parents,” Aman told the police in her initial statement. “Zoha was taken to a local hospital in Topi when she was almost choking to death after eight hours,” she added.

The Gadoon Amazai Industrial Estate Police Station House Officer, Farooq Khan, told The News that they are waiting for the chemical examination report to launch proper investigation and register an FIR. Though the police believe it looks like a well-planned murder, they are still waiting for the forensic report despite the lapse of a week.",['Bureau Report'],"PESHAWAR: Newly-married Zoha, 18, was allegedly poisoned to death by her in-laws in Gandaf village in district Swabi on June 28.

LAHORE: Some 19 days on, eight special teams formed by the Punjab Police to arrest Abid Ali, one of the two men sought for his alleged involvement in the gang-rape of a woman on the M11 motorway earlier this month, remains at large.



On September 9, two armed men had allegedly gang-raped a woman in front of her children after her car broke down and the family was stranded on the Lahore-Sialkot motorway. The assailants fled after the alleged assault, also reportedly taking her money and other valuables with them.



Abid — the main suspect whose sketches with different hairstyles and facial hair were released by police almost 10 days ago — slipped through the authorities' fingers thrice, sources informed Geo News. A Rs2.5-million reward was announced by the Punjab government to anyone who had information on the alleged rapist.

The eight special teams — comprising personnel from the Punjab Police's Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) and Crime Investigation Agency (CIA), Special Branch, and the Quick Response Force — almost caught him thrice in Kasur, Nankana Sahib, and Sheikhupura but he managed to evade police each time, sources added.

So far, police have blacklisted the suspect, blocked his and his wife's computerised national identity cards (CNICs), detained his wife, daughter, father, brother, and brother-in-law, and arrested accomplice Shafqat Ali.

However, authorities in Lahore and across Punjab have failed in nabbing Abid and he continues to be on the run.

Integrated network, rapid-response teams

Almost a week ago, the deputy inspector-general (DIG) of police for investigations, Shahzada Sultan, had expressed hope, saying the fugitive would also be arrested soon like his accomplice.

Sultan — who heads a six-member special investigation team set up by the inspector-general (IG) of police for Punjab, Inam Ghani — had said at least eight designated raid teams were working to search for the prime accused.

The Punjab Police had also laid down an integrated network, including rapid-response teams, in different districts across the province based on tip-offs about the presence of Abid, as well as at his known hideouts.

DIG Sultan had noted at the time that two suspects have been found to be involved so far in the case.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/370968-reforms-and-the-police-force,,Reforms and the police force,"The PTI’s biggest achievement was the improvement made in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police under the KP Police Act, 2017. Imran Khan has attributed this success to former PPO Nasir Khan Durrani, who had his full backing.

According to news reports, Durrani introduced ruthless in-house accountability by dismissing almost 800 policemen and awarding punishments to over 6,000 staffers. He established police assistance lines in all districts and setup six specialised training schools. The model reporting rooms and the female desks helped to introduce public-friendly policing at the police station level. The PTI-led provincial government seems to have delivered by focusing on implementation and good governance. However, an in-depth study is needed to assess the ground reality.

Historically, a personality-driven agenda doesn’t last and needs a strong legal, political, financial, administrative, technical and accountability framework to be sustainable. A review of the KP Police Act 2017 shows that it is the same National Reconstruction Bureau (NRB) system without any major changes. The PTI now plans to replicate the KP model throughout Pakistan. It is, therefore, an opportune time to review the KP Police Act and the lessons learnt to resolve the structural and institutional issues.

After the 18th Amendment KP in 2017 was able to repeal the federal Police Order 2002. The appointment of the PPO was a sensitive issue in 2002 as he was a federal employee and could be recalled at any time. This issue still remains. The recruitment of ASP under the KP law is also at the federal level. Such service matters impinge on provincial autonomy.

The intent of the KP Police Act is to grant operational, financial and administrative autonomy to the police for improving services and reducing police excesses. To meet this objective, the police officers in 2002 proposed a separate police department at the provincial level headed by a police officer. The bureaucracy did not agree. There was a well-directed campaign against the Police Order 2002, claiming that the police was ‘be lagaam’, (ie, has no control over itself).

Under the KP Rules of Business, the police remains under the home secretary. This reporting relationship is adversarial and fragile. The NRB side-tracked this issue by including in the police order that overall superintendence shall vest in the provincial government and shall be exercised in such a manner to ensure that the police shall perform its duties efficiently and strictly in accordance with the law. However, a step forward was that PPO was granted powers of an ex-officio secretary. An option could be to create a police department headed by a non-police officer.

The NRB separated investigation from prosecution and other police work. It came under much criticism that inefficiency and corruption had doubled by the separation. The KP Police Act has continued with the same separation by making a legal affairs branch at the provincial level with offices at the district level and a specialist cadre. There is a duality of control over the investigation officer at the district level.

The direct link is with the legal branch. At the same time, the investigation staff is also answerable to the head of the district police (DPO). It isn’t clear whether there will be any separate investigation staff at the police station level? The whole concept of the separation of investigation needs to be made practical and efficient. At present, it is a bureaucratic tangle.

The NRB did away with the district commissioner (DC) system and made the DPO answerable to the district nazim. However, this relationship did not work. The KP Act has delinked the police from local elected representatives and the DPO is now solely responsible for maintaining law and order.

The reporting relationship among the DPO, nazim and the DC has been left vague as a coordination function only. Earlier, DCs were responsible and controlled the police. Should the DC, executive magistrates, or civilians be the interface between the police and the public? Should there be a role for local elected representatives?

The institutions under the KP Police Act need to be revisited. The number of women in the public safety commissions should be increased to four as one woman member cannot be effective. Overall, the KP Police Act has no enabling sections for encouraging women’s participation in the police force; the formation of women’s police station; providing women staff in police stations; and adopting anti-harassment measures.

By law, one member of the PPSC is to sit in as an observer in centralised purchases of the police. It is a purely procurement matter and has no link with investigating police excesses. The functions of the Regional Police Complaints Authority should be merged with PSCs to reduce bureaucracy and costs. The Dispute Resolution Council needs elaboration. The Police Policy Board, with eight police officers as members, has been included in the KP act to formulate service delivery strategies. It is toothless as PPO doesn’t need to consult it.

The concept of public liaison councils hasn’t been well-thought-out. It is not mandatory for the SHO to hold meetings with the council. The experience in Pakistan shows that such bodies become a nuisance rather than improve matters.

The section on their powers needs to be deleted as they are not implementable. The concept of a village police has been mentioned but not elaborated in the legislation. The institutions will only work if they are adequately resourced.

Regarding human resources, the recruitment of constables is done on the basis of the district of domicile while they can be transferred to other districts. The KP government may, on the recommendations of the KP Public Service Commission, appoint experts to assist the PPO. This is cumbersome. Although the term of police officers is two years, the same act negates this protection by providing a loophole for premature transfer.

To safeguard the tenure, the NRB, with great difficulty, was able to get the bureaucracy to agree to inserting the definition “exigency of service”, which requires reasons for premature transfers to be recorded in writing. The police law hasn’t been able to protect the premature transfer of the Pakpattan DPO.

The SHO is a grade-16 officer. This critical post should be upgraded to grade-17 in senior

ranks if the thana culture is to be changed.

At present, even 16 years after the enactment of the Police Order 2002, the Police Rules made under the Police Act 1861 are still in force. The NRB only was only able to enact the Police Order 2002 through a top-down approach as the bureaucracy and elected representatives were against giving autonomy to the police and establishing safety commissions. As a result, implementation suffered. KP’s experience shows that to bring any form of change the key prerequisite is political support at the highest level. Can this support be garnered in Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan, where a colonial mindset and corruption are deeply entrenched?

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/604898-usman-buzdar-is-there-to-stay-no-one-can-blackmail-me-says-pm-imran,,"Usman Buzdar is there to stay: No one can blackmail me, says PM Imran","PESHAWAR/LAHORE: Amid differences between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan and his key cabinet members, three provincial ministers were sacked on Sunday.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday categorically ruled out removal of Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar, and warned that nobody could blackmail him at all.

Those removed included Health Minister Shahram Khan Tarakai, Tourism, Sports and Culture Minister Mohammad Atif Khan and Revenue and Estate Minister Shakeel Khan. Shahram Tarakai and Atif Khan are related to each other.

The ministers were sacked for not heeding the cabinet’s decisions and creating difficulties, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Information Minister Shaukat Yousafzai was reported as saying by Geo News.

Prime Minister Imran Khan, Yousafzai added, decided to remove them for their negative behaviour. Sunday’s notification had also said the lawmakers were removed from office with ""immediate effect"".

The information minister said no one would be allowed to blackmail the ruling PTI or the government. Khan was also a candidate for the KP chief minister post but was given the biggest ministry, as well as, four provincial departments, he added.

Atif Khan never accepted incumbent Mahmood Khan as the chief minister and continued to create difficulties, Yousafzai explained. According to senior leaders of Pakistan Tehreek-I-Insaf (PTI), Prime Minister Imran Khan had personally approved the removal of the three ministers.

There had been differences for quite some time between the chief minister and some of his cabinet members including, Shahram Khan Tarakai and Atif Khan. However, it was stated to be a difficult decision for Chief Minister Mahmood Khan to remove Shahram Tarakai and Atif Khan from the cabinet as both were considered to be close to Prime Minister Imran Khan.

Shahram Tarakai and Atif Khan had long association with Imran Khan and were in the good books of the PTI chairman. It was not less than a surprise to many party leaders, including Shahram Tarakai and Atif Khan, that Imran Khan would sack them ignoring their long association with him and PTI. The two ministers and some other party legislators were reportedly critical of Mahmood Khan in indoor meetings for his alleged poor performance and growing corruption in the government that damaged PTI’s image in the public.

According to the party insiders, Shahram Tarakai and Atif Khan before publicly criticising the chief minister had raised the issue with the prime minister and informed him a number of times that corruption was rising in government departments. They said Imran Khan was not happy over the differences between the chief minister and the two senior ministers.

Senior party leaders were expecting Imran Khan to call the two sides to Islamabad and listen to them. “Our assessment was that he will call them and carefully listen to their complaints. We expected he would constitute a committee of senior PTI leaders to resolve the issues between the chief minister and the cabinet members,” said a senior PTI leader in Peshawar.

Pleading anonymity, he said until Friday the prime minister had no intention of taking such a serious action against the cabinet members, but when he called Mahmood Khan to Islamabad upon his return from overseas he changed his mind.

According to PTI leaders, some senior party leaders from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa played a “very negative role in creating doubts in the mind of the prime minister and made him believe that Shahram Tarakai and Atif Khan were in fact creating problems for the government.”

“The prime minister even without listening to the other side of the story removed the ministers from their positions. I am sure he was presented a wrong picture and I know certain people played a very negative role in this crisis,” said a party insider.

Also, sources close to the prime minister in Islamabad told The News that there were rumours in the party that Imran Khan is expected to replace the chief ministers of Punjab and KP in March or April 2020. In KP, it was reportedly discussed that Atif Khan is the favourite choice of Imran Khan to replace Mahmood Khan.

“I don’t know if Imran Khan had any such plan for Atif Khan but some people told the prime minister that Atif Khan and his group was creating problems for the PTI government in KP at the behest of some key powerful quarters. And that could be one of the reasons he removed them from the cabinet without listening to them,” said the PTI leader in Islamabad.

According to sources, Mahmood Khan was initially reluctant to take action against the cabinet members but some other party people opposed to Shahram Tarakai and Atif Khan instigated him and assured him of their support.

“It is no more a secret that things are not satisfactory in KP and the chief minister is not delivering. I am afraid that people who supported him in this critical situation will now blackmail him to make decisions as per their wish,” said a PTI legislator close to the chief minister.

This correspondent spoke to Shahram Tarakai and Atif Khan and both said they didn’t expect the decision. They, however, avoided to react to their removal and said they would respond in time.

“Obviously, we didn’t have any personal interest and our sole aim was to bring relief to the common man in the province. We may or may not react to this decision as we don’t believe in blackmailing or maligning people,” said Shahram Tarakai.

There were media reports that Prime Minister Imran Khan had called the two senior ministers to Islamabad after their removal but Atif Khan denied these reports.

Earlier, sources close to the chief minister told The News that the differences cropped up after Mahmood Khan refused to accommodate in the cabinet some party MPAs recommended to him by the cabinet members.

“There would have been no issue had the chief minister adjusted their nominees in the cabinet. The chief minister used to hold them in high esteem as he knew about their connections with Imran Khan and status in the party,” said a PTI office-bearer close to the chief minister.

Also, the sources said that Mahmood Khan was already under pressure from National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser and Federal Minister Ali Amin Gandapur who wanted him to adjust their younger brothers in the cabinet, which he refused.

Mahmood Khan’s opponents had also alleged that he had no role in the governance and was letting non-elected people make important decisions.

They particularly mentioned names of two senior bureaucrats, one sitting in Islamabad and close to the prime minister, and another close to the chief minister in Peshawar for allegedly making all important decisions of KP government.

In Lahore, the prime minister firmly supported Punjab CM Usman Buzdar while speaking to parliamentarians, ministers and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Punjab office-bearers at 8-Club Road here.

The PM said he would not succumb to any pressure and made it clear that Usman Buzdar was the chief executive in Punjab and the bureaucracy was under his command.

Punjab CM Usman Buzdar, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and senior leaders of the PTI Punjab as well as senior officials of central and Punjab governments were also present.

The PM met MNAs and MPAs from Punjab in two different sessions in which most of his party members slammed the Punjab bureaucracy over lack of cooperation with them. An MPA from Rawalpindi lodged complaint about the Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) concerned for not paying attention to the genuine grievances of people. He said the police official did not even bother to pick phone calls of the MPAs.

The PM took notice of the situation and directed the officials concerned to address the complaint. Similarly, some of the MPAs also lodged complaints that bureaucrats were obliging one another and favouring their relatives but their dealing with the elected team of Punjab was totally different. They complained that their development projects were not being implemented.

Some of the members also urged the prime minister to empower his chief minister. At this, according to sources, the PM categorically stated that Buzdar was the chief executive of the province.

He directed the Punjab government to address all just grievances of the MNAs, MPAs and at the same time, he stated that no tolerance would be shown towards unlawful and corrupt practices. The PM also directed his political and official teams not to promote nepotism even if anyone was PM’s relative. He also asked his team to pay attention to development of their areas, which could not be ignored at all.

The PM also called for evolving an effective mechanism, aimed at solving problems of people and creating a good coordination between bureaucracy and the elected representatives.

Imran Khan made it clear that he had never succumbed to any pressure in the past nor would he do so in future. He said he had passed through a testing phase and now things were moving in the right direction and urged his stalwarts to avoid infighting and continue to move ahead with a positive intent.

Imran Khan also took his team into confidence over his recent visit to Davos and stated that now Pakistan was being envisaged as a safe country from investment point of view and situation was improving for the country. He said the foreign companies had shown interest in investing in Pakistan.

The PM said he knew who was a conspirator, and from where he was hatching plans against Punjab chief minister, according to Geo News.

The prime minister said he knew who was creating a controversy to oust Buzdar and that the conspirator wanted the post for himself.

“If the incumbent CM was removed, the new one, too, would be forced to step down in a similar manner,” the prime minister warned. A new chief minister, if appointed, would not even last 20 days, he added.

The premier said there was negative propaganda that Buzdar did not have the required authority; however, the chief secretary and inspector-general (IG) of Punjab were new and would work as part of the CM's team, he added. The premier told the meeting participants that CM Buzdar had complete authority.

PM Imran also tasked the Punjab government to quickly hold municipal elections at a village-council level, emphasising that lower-level

Arshad Aziz Malik adds: This correspondent had reported in Jang and The News that differences between KP CM Mahmood Khan and some of his cabinet members had deepened and that PM Imran had also taken notice of the friction.

Senior PTI leaders had told the publication on Thursday that certain people in the party also took notice of the differences and decided to constitute a jirga to resolve the issue before it damages the government and the party.

Meanwhile, expressing satisfaction over the performance of Jam Kamal Khan,Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani on Sunday said that he will remain the chief minister of Balochistan, reported a private news channel.

Talking to journalists along with Balochistan Assembly Speaker Abdul Quddus Bazanjo and Defence Minister Pervez Khattak in Islamabad, Sadiq Sanjrani said that Jam Kamal is ensuring good governance in the province and he will continue his services as chief minister of the province.

The Senate chairman underscored the need for dialogues to resolve issues. On the occasion, the Balochistan Assembly speaker thanked the leadership for hearing grievances and said that strengthening Balochistan will further strengthen Pakistan.

Pervez Khattak, in his remarks, said the committee constituted by the prime minister is in contact with other parties of the province. It is pertinent to mention here that Bizenjo had submitted a privilege motion against Balochistan CM on January 24. He was of the view that the CM’s remarks about him were unnecessary and non-parliamentary.

Earlier on January 23, Chief Minister Balochistan Jam Kamal had said that he was not giving much attention to the remarks of the Speaker Balochistan Assembly Abdul Quddus Bizenjo and had said that the coalition government in the province had performed after coming into power.

He had said that the government should only be judged by the works it had carried out rather than hurling blames at each other. “It would not matter if I say that the Center or a province is not performing to my expectations,” he had said.","['Faizan Bangash', 'Mushtaq Yusufzai']","Meanwhile, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday categorically ruled out removal of Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar, and warned that nobody could blackmail him at all.

In KP, it was reportedly discussed that Atif Khan is the favourite choice of Imran Khan to replace Mahmood Khan.","['pti', 'usman', 'party', 'chief', 'punjab', 'atif', 'buzdar', 'stay', 'imran', 'prime', 'khan', 'blackmail', 'minister', 'cabinet']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/700X390_thenews.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/reporters/227_094014_reporter.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/reporters/207_084610_reporter.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-01-27/l_604898_072144_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-01-27/604898_6654456_1_akhbar.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-01-27/l_604898_072144_updates.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'Buzdar is there to stay: No one can blackmail me, says PM', 'description': 'Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday categorically ruled out removal of Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar, and warned that nobody could blackmail him at all', 'keywords': 'usman,buzdar,stay,blackmail,imran', 'fb': {'app_id': 650123461797330}, 'og': {'title': 'Buzdar is there to stay: No one can blackmail me, says PM', 'image': {'identifier': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-01-27/l_604898_072144_updates.jpg', 'secure_url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-01-27/l_604898_072144_updates.jpg', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'width': 390}, 'description': 'Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday categorically ruled out removal of Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar, and warned that nobody could blackmail him at all', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/604898-usman-buzdar-is-there-to-stay-no-one-can-blackmail-me-says-pm-imran', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@thenews_intl', 'creator': '@Faizan Bangash  & Mushtaq Yusufzai', 'title': 'Usman Buzdar is there to stay: No one can blackmail me, says PM Imran', 'description': 'Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday categorically ruled out removal of Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar, and warned that nobody could blackmail him at all', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-01-27/l_604898_072144_updates.jpg?t=020232'}, 'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style': 'black-translucent', 'apple-mobile-web-app-title': 'The News International', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#333333', 'theme-color': '#000000'})",[],news
https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/494598-pti-on-the-move-to-save-itself-from-blackmailing-of-allies,,PTI on the move to save itself from blackmailing of allies,"LAHORE: The growing proximity between the PTI and disgruntled parliamentarians elected on PML-N tickets in the last general elections has raised several questions regarding the level of trust between the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and its key ally the PML-Q.

Currently, the six MNAs of the PML-Q and its 10 MPAs in Punjab are the reason behind keeping the PTI governments intact in the centre and the province but within a week after the passage of budget, the PTI government has quite smartly started working on a new option of brining the disgruntled elements of the PML-N together so that it could no more face trouble in the hands of its allies or to at least save itself from humiliation of losing the government all of a sudden.

The PTI has started to bring the angry stalwarts of the PML-N closer, which clearly indicated that it wants to keep a ‘back up’ in case the PML-Q ditches Imran Khan or exert pressure on his government for the fulfillment of their demands.

Sources stated that Punjab Governor Chaudhry Sarwar who doesn’t enjoy good relations with the PML-Q leadership has been assigned the task by the PTI high command to hold negotiations with political parties, particularly the PML-N. The first example of this latest task assigned to Sarwar, also a former N-Leaguer, became obvious on Friday when PML-N MPA Jameel Sharaqpuri called on Sarwar at the Governor’s House.

Jameel Sharaqpuri was one of those MPAs elected from Punjab on PML-N ticket and recently had a meeting with Prime Minister Imran Khan in Islamabad in clear violation of the party line. Other elected MPAs of the PML-N, who called on Prime Minister Imran Khan in the presence of Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar, are Ghayasuddin of Narowal and Ashraf Ali Ansari from Gujranwala.

Within next couple of days after this meeting, Governor Sarwar on a short notice was called by the PM in Islamabad where he instructed him to play an active role not only in countering a strike call given by the opposition but also having a dialogue with the disgruntled elements within the PML-N.

This is noteworthy that Chaudhry Sarwar, who is holding the office of governor Punjab for the second term within the last five years is the major figure related to the PTI governments, who still has good inroads within the PML-N. After developing differences with the Sharifs, Sarwar resigned from the office of governor in January 2015 and joined the PTI. He served as the Punjab organizer of the PTI for the next couple of years and just before the PML-N tenure was coming to end, in the Senate polls held in March 2018, he was the only PTI senator who got elected for the slot.

Sarwar surprised many in that election as he got 13 votes (total 46) more than the actual strength of the PTI in the Punjab Assembly and PML-N candidate Zubair Gull had to lose the election because of it. After the PTI government came into power, Sarwar was appointed governor Punjab and now has been assigned the task to gain maximum numbers from the rival parties so that PTI allies couldn’t blackmail it on crucial junctures. Besides, the PTI also wants to gain maximum strength in the Senate polls of 2021 and the secret support by the PML-N MPAs to its senators could add more numbers to its basket.

Though apparently in Punjab and Centre, the relationship between the PTI and the PML-Q seem to have been moving ahead well but there has been certain occasion when the PML-Q has expressed differences with its major partner. The first example of differences between the PTI and the PML-Q came to surface when in November 2018, just a few months after the formation of PTI government, Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi’s leaked video tape made headlines in which he was seen advising senior PTI leader Jehangir Khan Tareen to ‘control Sawar’. This meeting was held just a few days before the Senate by-polls in which the PML-Q expressed its reservations towards the governor Punjab, particularly over his interference in the affairs of district Bahawalpur from where PML-Q MNA and Federal Minister Tariq Bashir Cheema comes.

The PML-Q, however, gave complete support to the PTI in Senate polls, which won both seats in a very close fight in form of Waleed Iqbal and Seemi Ezdi, the sister of Jehangir Khan Tareen. Later, in January this year, another incident posed a question mark between the relationship of the PTI and the PML-Q when Hafiz Ammar Yasir, the only Q-Leaguer in the cabinet of Chief Minister Umsan Buzdar, tendered resignation in protest against the interference in his ministry by the bureaucracy. Though apparently, the reason told to media for this resignation was constant interference of the officials of the CM Secretariat in his domain but sources stated that delay in the induction of PML-Q MNA Chaudhry Moonis Elahi was also a main issue that irked the Q leadership. Later, the issue was resolved when Naeemul Haq, special assistant to the prime minister, visited the Chaudhrys and Hafiz Ammar Yasir was convinced to withdraw his resignation that he did. Not only this, the PML-Q also got one more ministry in Punjab in form of Bau Rizwan, elected for the third time from Sialkot.

Regarding the induction of Chaudhry Moonis Elahi in the cabinet, the issue was kept pending till the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman who visited Pakistan in the mid of February this year. However, the major demand of the PML-Q regarding the induction of Chaudhry Moonis Elahi in the federal cabinet remained unfulfilled and later the verbal war between Moonis and Fawad Chaudhry also came to surface that once again posed several question marks about the relationship between the two allies. After this, when the PTI government in Punjab passed the Local Government Bill 2019, Chaudhry Moonis Elahi once again openly criticized this decision while exposing several loopholes in the hurriedly-done legislation. The PTI government in Centre also had to face a testing time in wooing its allies like Akhter Mengal in the passage of budget, though the PML-Q didn’t create any trouble for the government at this juncture. It is still awaiting the PTI to honour its commitment regarding the induction of Moonis Elahi in federal cabinet. The News tried to contact Governor Sarwar but he wasn’t available for comment. His staff, however, confirmed the meeting of PML-N MPA from Sheikhupura Jameel Sharaqpuri with him. Federal Minister belonging to PML-Q Tariq Bashir Cheema, when contacted, said the PML-Q is an ally of the government and it has no issue when any member from any party meets Sarwar. He said the PML-Q wants to see the government in a stronger position and is playing the role of an ally.",['Faizan Bangash'],"Sources stated that Punjab Governor Chaudhry Sarwar who doesn’t enjoy good relations with the PML-Q leadership has been assigned the task by the PTI high command to hold negotiations with political parties, particularly the PML-N.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/505726-forced-marriage-conversion-un-islamic-imran,,"Forced marriage, conversion un-Islamic: Imran","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan Monday said there was no precedent in the Islamic history for forced conversion of others and those indulging in this practice had no knowledge of the history of Islam, the holy Quran and the Sunnah.

Addressing a function at the Aiwan-e-Sadr in connection with the National Minority Day, he said the solution to Pakistan’s problems lay in the rule of law.

“Our battle is for the rule of law,” he emphasised.

For the Muslims, there was only one model state and that’s the State of Madina, he said and suggested that there should be a PhD on it as to how the Holy Prophet (Peace be Upon Him) established Madina as a model state.

Imran noted that if one looked at the modern day states, one could find so many things, which had been derived from the State of Madina.

“I have a vision for Naya Pakistan,” he remarked.

The prime minister made it clear that he had talked about the State of Madina after the 2018 general election and all knew those, who had run their ‘political shows’ in the name of Islam in Pakistan. “Those who convert others to Islam through force neither know Islam nor its history. There is no concept of coercion in Islam. How can we take into our own hands the matter of forcefully converting others to Islam by marrying women or taking them on gunpoint or killing someone because of their religion?” he asked.

""All these things are un-Islamic. If God did not give his messengers the power to impose their beliefs on someone, then who are we?"" he asked and explained that the messengers' duty was only to spread the word of God. Imran said the life of Holy Prophet (SAW) was a road map for the entire humanity to follow until the Day of Judgment. He explained that the Holy Prophet (SAW) had given the minorities religious freedom and protected their places of worship because the holy Quran orders that there be no compulsion in religion. The prime minister maintained that since coming into power, he had been saying that the State of Madina was the only model for Pakistan, which had been created in the name of Islam.

He also shared that Poet-Philosopher Allama Muhammad Iqbal had said that when Muslims rise, they aspire to this model (the model of the State of Madina) and when they fall, they deviate from this model.

""This is why I want this model to be studied in the country. What was the State of Madina? We are trying that universities teach courses on the State of Madina"".

He said the government was just implementing the law against the previous leaders but they were raising a hue and cry.

“Look at the ‘tamasha’ of those, who remained in power for 10 years. They were not ready to give answers with regard to Rs24,000 billion debt on Pakistan, whereas a party head is answerable that’s why I submitted detailed documents to the court of law,” he said.

Referring to the opposition leaders, he said they had facilities like AC and TV in jail.

“The bigger the criminal, the greater the facilities for him,” he said and assured the minorities that all possible measures would be taken for their protection and provision of maximum facilities to them. In this context, he said the government would also change the mindset of people.

Imran said the government would protect and develop worship places of minorities in the country and also facilitate them to the maximum level to perform their religious rituals.

He also assured the audience that the government was committed to opening Kartarpur Corridor for the Sikh community on the 550th birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak.

Addressing the event, President Dr Arif Alvi reiterated that the ideas of the State of Madina be brought to Pakistan and added that the government believed in pursuing the ideals of the State of Madina to ensure equal rights to all its citizens irrespective of their caste, creed, sect and religion.

The Holy Prophet (SAW), he noted, always raised voice for the rights of deprived segments of the society including the minorities.

He said the life and teachings of the Holy Prophet (SAW) served as a guiding principle for the Muslim Ummah as to how to treat the minorities”.

“Ours is the most compassionate nation and it has proved it by hosting millions of Afghan refugees for many decades,” he said.",['Mumtaz Alvi'],"Imran noted that if one looked at the modern day states, one could find so many things, which had been derived from the State of Madina.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/728367-prime-suspect-in-lahore-motorway-gang-rape-case-abid-ali-arrested,,Prime suspect in Lahore Motorway gang-rape case Abid Malhi arrested in major breakthrough,"The prime suspect in the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway gang-rape case, Abid Malhi, was arrested on Monday after a period of over one month, Geo News reported.



Police said that Abid is being brought to Lahore from Faisalabad where his DNA test will be taken.

The other suspect who allegedly raped the woman, Shafqat, is in jail on judicial remand. The Intelligence Bureau (IB), Special Branch of the police and other agencies had done a recce of the suspect and tipped off Punjab Police about the whereabouts of Malhi.

Malhi's DNA test had been obtained thrice from the motorway rape victim's samples. However, once more his DNA test will be taken and matched with the samples before any formal proceedings begin against him.

Key points about motorway rape suspect Abid Malhi's arrest:

- Suspect falls into trap laid out by Punjab police

- Police used Malhi's wife to lure him to Faisalabad

- His DNA test will be taken and matched with samples of the victim

- After the DNA tests, formal proceedings against Malhi will be initiated

- Punjab Police intentionally ""cooled things down"", says Fayyaz Chohan

- Malhi got to know about police raids from media reports: Chohan

The motorway rape case's prime suspect had managed to evade arrest four times by escaping the clutches of the Punjab police.

How did police manage to catch the motorway rape suspect?

Sources told Geo News that a trap had been laid out for the motorway rape prime suspect, falling into which he was apprehended by police. Sources informed Geo News that Malhi's wife was given a SIM which she used to call him.

Malhi told his wife in one of his calls to her that he would meet her in Faisalabad. When the motorway rape suspect arrived in the city to meet her, he was nabbed by police officials in plain clothes.

According to Geo News correspondent Ahmad Faraz, Malhi was arrested without any torture or scuffle. He was apprehended easily and taken from Faisalabad to Lahore.

Punjab govt to do everything in its power to make 'example out of him'

Speaking to Geo News, Punjab information minister Fayyaz Chohan said that the provincial government would do everything in its power to make an example out of the motorway rape suspect.

Talking about how the Punjab government aims to prosecute Malhi as he had managed to be secure a bail previously despite rape charges, he said:

Chohan said that without speaking to the motorway rape victim, the Punjab government had managed to identify the suspects within 72 hours.

""No shortcomings will take place from [the government's side],"" Chohan said of the case.

He said that Malhi had managed to escape the clutches of the police due to detailed media hype and reporting about him.

""Due to the media's hype regarding the case, he escaped police raids four to five times as he used to get information from his sources about the police,"" said the information minister.

Chohan said that the Punjab police had ""intentionally cooled down things"" over the things and observed that Malhi had also relaxed over the past 10-12 days which ultimately led him to become less careful.

The minister said that to hide details of the investigation from the public at large, he used to ""play down questions asked to me"" about the motorway gang-rape case during press conferences.

The information minister stressed that if the prosecution, police, and the judicial system play their role in the right manner, then such people would not escape the law again.

Prime suspect in motorway rape case raped woman and her daughter in 2013

According to reports, Shafqat and Abid were at the Lahore-Sialkot motorway on Sept 9 with an intention to rob any motorist when they saw a stationary white-coloured car on the roadside. The two approached the vehicle, threatened and robbed its occupants, and then gang-raped the woman in front of her children after dragging them to a nearby field.

Police had earlier disclosed that apart from Shafqat's statement, his DNA had to match as well, which is why the samples had been sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA). The arrest was made with use of footprint-tracking as well as DNA samples.

The PFSA had Abid's prior DNA records from 2013, when he had raped a woman and her daughter and was booked alongside four others under Sections 376 and 395. While he had been bailed out at the time, his DNA and fingerprint records were saved in the lab's data bank.

The lab's system identified him as the same rapist from more than seven years ago.

PEMRA directs to stop coverage of motorway rape case

On October 2, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) had barred all satellite TV channels from covering the motorway rape case.

A notification from the regulatory authority had stated that the airing of content related to the investigation of the case will diminish the ""evidentiary worth of the material collected by the prosecution"".

PEMRA stated in its notification that since the offence is related to a sex crime, hence media coverage concerning the victim and her family will also be a cause of discomfort and disgrace for her.

The authority told news channels to refrain from airing any content with regard to the case on electronic, print, and social media, in the future, and warned that in case of non-compliance, strict legal action will be taken as per PEMRA's ordinance.

What is the motorway rape case about?

Malhi has been on the run since September 9, when it was reported that two robbers had allegedly gang-raped a mother of three on the Lahore-Sialkot motorway in an area falling within Gujjarpura police's jurisdiction.

The woman, along with her children, was driving to Gujranwala when she was forced to stop at the Gujjarpura section of the motorway after running out of fuel, at around 1:30am.

She immediately called a relative and sent him her location. He asked her to also dial the Motorway Police helpline 130 from which she reportedly received no response.

In the meantime, two robbers reportedly approached the car, broke the window, and took the woman and her children to nearby bushes where they allegedly raped her in front of the children.

They also allegedly snatched her purse carrying Rs100,000 in cash, one bracelet, car registration papers, and three ATM cards.",[],"The prime suspect in the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway gang-rape case, Abid Malhi, was arrested on Monday after a period of over one month, Geo News reported.

The deputy director of the FIA’s Cyber Crime Wing, Mohammad Iqbal, said several pornographic and sexually explicit videos were recovered from the suspect during the raid. A first information report (FIR) has been registered against him as well, he added.

The man befriended children through PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, an online battle royale game popularly known as PUBG, and multiplayer video game 8 Ball Pool, Iqbal explained.

The FIA official said the suspect also used to solicit sexually explicit videos from children by luring them in with offers of giving them PUBG’s in-game currency, G-Coins.

“In the past, the culprit had forced some children into sending him videos of their families, after which he would blackmail them,” he added. The parents of one of the kids had earlier submitted a request to investigate the matter and register a case against the suspect, Iqbal explained. The alleged paedophile has cyber-abused and threatened children from Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Punjab along with their families, the FIA official said. The criminal investigation and cybercrime agency was investigating the sale of pornographic videos by the suspect as well, Iqbal stated. Earlier this week, another Pakistani man from Punjab was arrested for allegedly sharing and owning sexually-explicit videos of kids after Brazil — through the help of the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) — shared documents and other evidence linking him to an international child pornography ring. The man, identified as Riaz, a resident of Narowal, was in possession of more than 600 sexually-explicit videos of children, according to the FIA’s Cyber Crime Wing in Gujranwala.",['News Report'],"GUJRANWALA: A man who used online games such as PUBG and 8 Ball Pool to blackmail children into sending sexually explicit videos has been arrested, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) confirmed on Sunday, adding that he was detained following an operation in Jamshoro.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/563536-journey-ravita-gulnaz,,The journey from Ravita to Gulnaz,"The recent alleged case of abduction, forcible religious conversion and marriage of a minor Hindu girl to a Muslim man twice her age in Tharparkar district has created uproar among the minority community living in Sindh province.

The Pakistan People’s Party provincial government is being criticised for withdrawing a bill against forced conversion passed unanimously in November last year, bowing down to the pressure of religious parties.

On June 6, Ravita Meghwar, a 16-year-old Hindu girl, was abducted from a village of Nangarparkar, Tharkarpar district, and reportedly converted to Islam from Hinduism at a khanqah of spiritual leader Pir Muhammad Ayub Jan Sirhindi in Umerkot district’s Samaro Taluka. Thirty six-year-old Ali Nawaz Shah, a member of influential Syed family, has married Ravita after converting her to Islam and changing her name to Gulnaz.

Satram Das Meghwar, Ravita’s father, registered a case in local police station against Shah, claiming that her daughter had been illegally married off to Shah after having been abducted from her village. Terming marriage below the age of 18 a punishable offence under the Sindh Child Marriage Act, 2014, her father asked, ""At the age of 16, she does not even understand her own religion, how can she (willingly) convert to Islam?""

Seeking protection, Shah and Ravita have also filed an application in Sindh High Court. They have accused the girl’s parents of issuing death threats. Talking to local journalists, Ravita says that she has willingly decided to convert to Islam and marry Shah.

The incident has again sent shock waves among the Hindu community, forcing them to organise protest rallies across the province, slamming the PPP Sindh government for shying away from the bill criminalising forced religious conversions and subsequent forced marriages.

""Political parties such as the PPP cannot endure pressure from religious parties. Now the Hindu community is demanding that the military intervene to save their daughters,"" Birma tells TNS.

On November 24, 2016, members of Sindh Assembly, setting aside their political differences and speaking in one voice, unanimously passed The Sindh Criminal Law (Protection of Minorities) Bill, making forced conversions punishable with a life sentence and forbidding minors from changing their religion, in a bid to protect minorities.

Nand Kumar Goklani, a legislator of the Pakistan Muslim League-Functional, who belongs to the Hindu community, proposed the bill in the assembly a year ago. The bill was passed on the basis of a report of the Standing Committee on Minority Affairs, which had reviewed the bill. The bill recommends five year punishment for perpetrators and three year sentence for facilitators of forceful religious conversions.

However, then Governor Sindh Justice (retd) Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui refused to ratify the bill on January 6. In his observation to the Sindh Assembly secretariat, Siddiqui (who passed away on January 11) asked to reconsider the legislation and make changes.

Sindh Assembly members, who were instrumental in passing the bill, said that the PPP’s leadership bowed to pressure from religious parties, who started protesting against the legislation after it was passed unanimously.

The religious parties from different schools of thoughts, which organised several protests and all-parties conferences, opposed the bill because it says no one under the age of 18 can convert to Islam even out of their free will. Simultaneously, several lawmakers who were involved in drafting and presenting the bill, received life threats from militant groups. An alert issued by the Special Branch advised to ensure security of lawmakers, especially Kumar, who proposed the bill, and Nisar Ahmed Khuhro, Sindh’s senior minister.

""The bill contradicts Islamic principles and violates the Pakistani Constitution,"" says Mufti Muhammad Naeem, principal of Jamia Binori Al-Alamia seminary in Karachi, one of the places where people convert to Islam. ""Islam does not allow forced conversions, but there should be no restriction on people converting to Islam of their own free will"".

In the past five years, around 600 people, including 52 foreigners, have converted to Islam at the seminary.

A number of civil society and Hindu rights activists gathered outside the Karachi Press Club on June 20 to condemn the ‘forced conversion’ of Ravita. Jesrani Birma, a Hindu rights activist, one among the protestors, says that the PPP has withdrawn the forced conversion bill in order to appease religious parties which do not have representation in the Sindh Assembly. ""Political parties such as the PPP cannot endure pressure from religious parties. Now the Hindu community is demanding that the military intervene to save their daughters,"" Birma tells TNS.

However, PPP leaders, who are privy to the development, opine that Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, PPP Chairman, supported the bill and asked the provincial lawmakers not to bow to the pressure of religious parties. Bilawal’s acts, such as attending the Holi festival in Umerkot last year, and supporting the passing of progressive legislations, including Hindu Marriage Act, Women’s Protection Act and Child Marriage Act, were much-admired by the civil society, non-Muslim communities and progressive circles. But return of Asif Ali Zardari changed the game.

Ghazal Asif, a scholar doing research on Hindu communities in Sindh, believes that forced conversions, kidnappings and marriages has instilled a sense of insecurity among non-Muslims in the country. ""There is a very clear sense of being abandoned by the state. I also think it shows very clearly that for the government, religious minorities remain second-class citizens. They are not treated the same as Muslims or given the same system of justice.""

Terming PPP’s backtracking from the bill a shocking precedent, she says, ""the bill was not perfect but its retraction is totally undemocratic. The provincial and national governments are not serious about protecting the millions of Hindus, Christians and other religious minorities. Perhaps, then, people are right to wonder if they are being abandoned by a partisan state held hostage by the religious right.""",[],"Thirty six-year-old Ali Nawaz Shah, a member of influential Syed family, has married Ravita after converting her to Islam and changing her name to Gulnaz.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/485720-inefficiency-and-corruption-blotch-police,,Inefficiency and corruption blotch police,"Islamabad : By and large performance of police has touched the most minuscule ebb with hardly any interest being shown by the government or by the department itself to first to arrest the rot and then take steps to revive the actual spirit of policing, a police officer holding a key office in the Punjab, observed on the condition of anonymity.

It may sound harsh and sort of a sweeping statement but unfortunately this is an undeniable fact that the priorities of a vast majority of our ‘Police Service of Pakistan’ (PSP) officers have completely changed from policing to self-projection and money collection by using their office. But majority of the PSP officers are intend to concentrate on professional policing with dignity and honour, the pragmatic officer kept up.

Gone are the days when the corrupt or dishonest police officers used to get immediately spotted and marked and would be described as the ‘black sheep’ of the department by their own brethren in uniform, the officer maintained.

Now are the days that if we find an honest and upright officer, we immediately start eulogizing him with good intention because of their dedication and aim to perform their duties with a noticeable level of honesty and commitment, he said and added “good repute is actually respect from God.”

“Any police command doesn’t carry a ‘magic wand’ that he will wave with a flourish and the things will change. We don’t expect him to turn the Islamabad Police into a model police force in the country over a short period of time,” the officer upheld. “But what pains us to note is that he has yet to take the right steps in the right direction to achieve what he has promised and what he is actually supposed to do as the commander of the police force,” he added.

A few directions he gave to the force only encouraged the corrupt and unscrupulous elements in the force to start abuse their powers with impunity. We have all the reasons to believe that he had issued those directions with all the good will behind those. But unfortunately the result is that the old culture of harassing poor public and extortion by patrolling police officials on the roads and in the streets is creeping back, the officer said.

There are still high hopes pinned on him concerning change in the prevailing police culture, which has crept in the federal territory from Punjab and has become so rotten that to change it has become a slogan for the political parties.

Amidst the prevailing environments, made murkier by the political confusion in the country, the inefficiency and corruption throughout the country, particularly, in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Police Department is going un-noticed.

Simply, because the evils of corruption, nepotism, dishonesty and abuse of power have dug their claws too deep in our society.

With obvious political influence on the department the ‘check and balance system’ for monitoring the performance of officials and officers, have tailed off badly, ultimately, reflecting adversely on the crime control and maintenance of law and order situation in the twin-cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad.

However, at the same time we have seen individuals in the same police department who had refused to budge to the pressure mounted by the politicians and had left highly appreciable impressions by improving the performance, thus winning the hearts and minds of public.

It has been observed that some Station House Officers (SHOs), the Sub-Divisional Police Officers (SDPOs), the Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASPs) and the Superintendent of Police (SPs) are not coming up to the set standards of efficiency in the performances of their duties.

The situation has created a discontented element in the force as they feel that they are not being awarded and rewarded for their good work while looking helplessly at their colleagues with shady and questionable service records being patronized because of political influence and clout they have mustered up.

This is observed that some upright and professional police officers have been side-lined without concrete reasons but the rationale was that they performed their duties in earlier period according to law during the previous long ‘sit-in’. Some victim police officers have posted out of Islamabad while some have joined UN Mission to avoid rage of the rulers.

This is an established fact that the upright, honest and professional officers feel themselves misfit in the police organism for the reason that they remain intolerable for the political robust who are running the faulty system of the law enforcing agency. Because of the political deeds, the government could not introduce the police reforms that were their first main concern and prime intention.

But at the same time it should be realised that any police command doesn’t carry a ‘magic wand’ that he will wave with a flourish and the things will change. We don’t expect him to turn the Islamabad Police into a model police force in the country over a short period of time.

We do realise that such a change cannot be induced overnight or even over a considerable period of time, counting in years. But what we expect is for the police bosses to see the reality and realize how compellingly essential it has become to take the right steps in the right direction, first to arrest the deterioration and then to eventually reach the goal.

But what pains us to note is that he has yet to take the right steps in the right direction to achieve what he has promised and what he is actually supposed to do as the leader of the Islamabad Police force.

At this stage we are in dire need of officers like Zulfiqar Cheema and Nasir Khan Durrani, who never compromised on the principles, astutely confronted the political pressure and brought about a change in the force under their direct control, creating small islands of honesty and integrity wherever they went to serve. But the best contribution they made towards Pakistan Police was that they nurtured and groomed a team of honest, dedicated and upright police officers, some of which are still working somewhere in the country challenging and confronting the prevalent dishonest system.

Now is the time that we need more and more of such officer who wrote history of policing and honesty in the department.

Former Inspector General of Police KP, Nasir Khan Durrani, when contacted by the correspondent for his comments, accepting overall deteriorating situation of the society including the police department, said training and motivation is basic requirement for the young officer. He expressed his sanguinity, saying that the youth of this country is upright, honest and cultured and has capability to put the country on right direction.

Afzal Ali Shigri, author of the police reform, when contacted by this scribe to know, how the police culture could be modified, said, “Yes, a notable number of PSP officers are involved in financial and moral corruption and getting away from professionalism. It is due to deteriorating situation of the society but lack of training is prime reason of the opting wrong track.” He said that weak command was not fulfilling his responsibilities and most important responsibility is to give motivation to the officers of young lot. Peer pressure from the close relative, friends and politicians put them on wrong track.

He admitted that the political intervention is not confined to the Police department all over the country but almost every department has been manipulated by the politicians for their own gains instead of serving the public and the state.",['Shakeel Anjum'],"But majority of the PSP officers are intend to concentrate on professional policing with dignity and honour, the pragmatic officer kept up.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/514368-rajnath-s-statement-a-nuclear-blackmail,,‘Rajnath’s statement a nuclear blackmail’,"LAHORE: Noted defence Analyst Dr Maria Sultan on Sunday termed the Indian Defence Minister Rajnath’s statement of rethinking no first use as nuclear blackmail which reflected the “Hindutva Ideology” of radical Indian Premier Narendra Modi.

Talking to APP, defence analyst and Chairperson South Asian Strategic Stability Institute (Sassi) University, Dr Maria Sultan, said the irresponsible statement of Rajnath Singh had put the region in dangerous stage. She termed the situation as unfortunate as Indian leadership was not recognising the gravity of threat associated with nuclear brinkmanship.

“Indian actions have showed that Kashmir was potentially the most dangerous zone on earth and a nuclear-flash point,” she added.

To a question, Dr Maria Sultan said that it was unfortunate that Indian radical PM Narendra Modi had a direct control over nukes, adding Indian national security adviser (NSA) was also another extremist with an intelligence background.

Expressing concern over the statement, she said that Narendra Modi with Saffron ideology, may decide on nukes endangering the peace of the whole world. In the prevailing situation, if Kashmir on lifting the curfew, erupts or reacts, the radical Indian PM and NSA chief could exercise nuclear option as India had failed badly to activate its military might against Pakistan, she said.

Dr Maria lamented that India’s National Command structure did not have checks and balances of International Security Standards, adding the Indian military chiefs were not a part of command and control structure which clearly indicates that Indian leadership does not have required clusters to deal with nuclear security. She said that international pressure and Kashmiri reaction could increase panic among Indian Army, which may trigger any irresponsible action by Indian radical chiefs.

To a query about the possible outbreak of war between the two neighboring countries, Maria Sultan said that world witnessed in February this year that Indian army, air force and navy were unable to move even a single inch soon after Pakistan shot down two Indian aircraft.

After downing of two aircraft, India went to activate its missiles, but this option was also countered by Pakistan. “So, we are in a different South Asia today (Monday),” she said.

To another question regarding US president’s mediation offer on Kashmir, she said that every inhabitant, country or organisation that worries about the threat of nuclear war has the right to intervene and do everything in its power to prevent it.

She said that racist actions and “Hindutua” ideology of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was rapidly pushing the entire region towards a grave looming threat, which is subjected to peace and security of the entire region.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/726337-opp-s-blackmail-not-to-pressurise-govt-says-shibli,,"Opp’s blackmail not to pressurise govt, says Shibli","KARACHI: Federal Minister Senator Shibli Faraz said that the government had no role at all in filing of the FIRs of sedition against leaders of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) including former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.

Speaking at a press conference here at the Karachi Press Club on Wednesday Shibli said the opposition parties had formed the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) to protect the wealth accumulated through corruption and not for any political cause. They were trying to divert the attention of masses from their corruption and seek an NRO (National Reconciliation Ordinance) from the government. He said that government would not come under any pressure of opposition’s blackmailing. The minister said the opposition parties had made politics a business. “They cannot pressurise the government for any kind of NRO.

The government under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan will continue its struggle to recover the looted national wealth, he added.

Senator Shibli Faraz has said that the federal government has taken no unconstitutional or illegal step by promulgating the ordinance to establish the Pakistan Islands Development Authority (PIDA).

Speaking at a press conference here at the Karachi Press Club on Wednesday, the federal minister said that the Constitution has the provision for promulgating the ordinances and the government has adopted a legal method to establish the PIDA.

He said that the government was developing a mechanism to link the provision of advertisements to media houses with the payment of salaries to their employees. The government had paid over Rs1 billion to the media outlets to clear their outstanding dues and tried to ensure that the employees’ salaries were paid from that amount, he said.

Earlier, talking to media persons at the Mazar-e-Quaid, the federal information minister said that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was given the mandate by the people to bring those who had plundered the national wealth to justice.

The incumbent government, which had completed two years in office, was making all-out efforts to steer the country out of crises and put it on the path to development. Everyone would have to work for the country’s development. He said Karachi was the country’s economic hub and despite limited resources, the federal government had initiated K-IV, Karachi circular railway and sewerage system. Replying to a question regarding the problems faced by the Karachiites due to the recent rains, Shibli Faraz said Prime Minister Imran Khan had directed for taking immediate steps to resolve them.

Like the mega city, he said, the PTI government also accorded importance to the development of other areas of Sindh to bring them at par with the rest of the country. Unfortunately, the Sindh government was not playing its due role in this regard, he regretted. Senator Shibli Faraz said that this was on record that first time the government had given advertisements to the newspapers, through transparent mechanism.

He expressed these views while talking to the office bearers of All Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS) here. Speaking on the occasion, President APNS Hameed Haroon briefed the minister in detail about the problems of print media, especially, the problems which were being confronted by the Sindhi newspapers. Secretary General APNS Sarmad Ali and other office bearers also spoke on the occasion.

Meanwhile, Shibli Faraz highlighted the need for a coordinated mechanism to help address genuine grievances of electronic media in the country. During a meeting with office-bearers of Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA), he said regular contact and mutual cooperation could help in efficient handling of issues, ultimately paving the way for their proper solutions. had paid over Rs1 billion to the media outlets to clear their outstanding dues and tried to ensure that the employees’ salaries were paid from that amount, he said.

Pakistan will raise objections to the construction of two water reservoirs on Chenab River, with a stance that it is a violation of the Indus Waters Treaty at a time when Pakistan is reeling under severe water shortage.

According to sources, a nine-member Indian delegation headed by Indian Water Commissioner PK Saxena will respond to these objections during the meetings.

Officials have confirmed that India wanted to place spillway of 1 000 megawatts of Pakal Dul Dam on Chenab River in the Indian-held Kashmir about 15 meters down against the permissible limit which will give the country undue leverage of holding 11,000 acres of feet water in addition to allowed volume of water storage.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/629450-teenage-girl-raped-on-promise-of-marriage-in-haripur,,Teenage girl raped on promise of marriage in Haripur,"HARIPUR: A teenage girl was raped repeatedly and her six-month pregnancy was allegedly aborted with the help of two health professionals in the limits of Saddar Police Station here on Saturday.

The police quoted (I), 15, a resident of village Guraki, as saying that Rafaqat Ali from the same village developed friendship with her a few months back.

She alleged that the man had raped her several times during the last six months and forced her to remain silent. She said that the man had promised to marry her.

However, when her pregnancy became visible she informed her parents three days back who contacted the alleged rapist who persuaded her parents to take her to a doctor for medical examination before the marriage.

The accused, according to the police, fraudulently took the victim to the private clinic of a lady health worker in Haripur City, who referred the pregnant girl for abortion to a local birth attendant.

According to the police, the two health workers aborted the six- month pregnancy for Rs45,000 but during the abortion procedure the condition of the victim became serious due to excessive bleeding. The two health professionals shifted her to the District Headquarters Hospital after her condition deteriorated, said the police official.

Minister for Women Julie Anne Genter, a Green MP and keen cyclist, chose pedal power for Sunday´s one kilometre (0.6 mile) journey from her home to Auckland City Hospital for the delivery.

Her action, dubbed ""the most onbrand thing ever"" by colleagues, was featured in media outlets across the world and drew an enthusiastic online response.

""WHAT A BABE,"" tweeted Hollywood star Kristin Bell, while others described her as ""one tough lady"".

Genter, who was 42 weeks pregnant, said the car was too small to accommodate her ""support crew"" and the bike ride ""put me in the best possible mood"".

After being induced, she gave birth late Tuesday.

""We´re overjoyed to announce the safe arrival of our son at 18.03 this evening, weighing almost 4.3kg (9 lb 8oz),"" she posted on social media.

""We waited a very long time for labour to start, but when it did it was short and sharp.""

Genter plans to take three months´ maternity leave.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who returned from six weeks´ maternity leave this month after the birth of daughter Neve, congratulated her colleague.

""So pleased to hear of the safe arrival of the newest addition to the parliamentary play group. Hope you enjoy those very special first few days,"" she tweeted.

The court has directed police to present the accused again on May 24.

Three police officials, Constable Muhammad Naseer, Constable Rashid Minhas, Constable Muhammad Azeem, and a civilian young man Amir Sikandar allegedly involved in the gang rape were produced in a court of duty magistrate, Rawalpindi. Station House Officer (SHO) Rawat brought all accused to the court.

Rawat Police has registered a case under Sections of 376B, 367A and 382 PPC against four accused for allegedly abducting 22-year-old girl Rafia Azeem and gang raping her.

City Police Officer (CPO) Muhammad Faisal Rana told The News that the accused will never be spared at any cost.

“I have suspended three police officials from service immediately,” he said. The CPO said police is a ‘Muhafiz’ of public, not a ‘looter’.

“I am strictly monitoring this case. The victim girl and her family are in police security,” he said.

The CPO said police have also taken all samples of marks which were on the victim’s body, and all samples have been sent for further investigation. “I have given special instructions to SP (Saddar) to make foolproof security arrangements around the victim’s house,” he assured.

Three police constables (Muhafaz Force) of Rawalpindi Police abducted the girl at around 2:00am on May 16, and allegedly gang raped her for the next two hours in the rear seat of official police vehicle before dropping her off near her hostel located in Commercial Centre, Satellite Town at around 4:00am. The three Rawalpindi Police constables were accompanied by a young civilian. All four have been arrested and their medical tests have been conducted already.

According to statement of the young girl in the FIR, she along with a friend, Umair Azam Kiyani had gone for outing and to have Sehri for keeping fast.

“We were stopped by a white Toyota Corolla car, bearing registration no: ADB-332, in which four persons were riding. They pulled both of us out of our vehicle and forced me to sit in their car on gun point while they threatened and told my friend Umair Azam Kiyani to go away. They drove off some distance and then parked the vehicle on the road side and put dark blinds on the windows of the vehicle and raped me one by one in the back seat of the car.

Later, they dropped me off near my hostel. Before freeing me, they snatched Rs30,000 as well as a gold ring valued at Rs12,000,” the girl said in the FIR.

The girl said the accused also asked her to stay in contact in future and threatened of dire consequences if she did otherwise. She said that she was too ashamed of what had happened to her and terrified as well and it took her a whole day to pick up courage and compose herself to approach the police to file the FIR.",['Khalid Iqbal'],"RAWALPINDI: Duty Magistrate Rawalpindi Kiran Ilyas on Sunday handed over four accused, including three policemen, allegedly involved in gang rape of a 22-year old girl, to police on a five-day physical remand.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/750241-rape-laws,,Rape laws,"According to reports that have been reaching the press and the public, the federal cabinet has decided to introduce new laws on rape, gang-rape, and sodomy, which will now also be counted as an offence equivalent to rape through an ordinance. In the first place, it is unclear why laws as sensitive as these with some provisions that are debatable, should be dealt with through an ordinance, which under the law stays in place only 120 days and is not debated by members of parliament. The role of parliament is after all to debate measures proposed to discuss the pros and cons and therefore make it easier to decide what would be most beneficial for the country and its people.

Pakistan already has a series of laws which deal with rape, gang-rape, and also child marriage or forcible remarriage. There are also issues such as the age of consent, with religious scholars also contesting what the age of marriage should be in terms of Islamic provisions and the law of Pakistan. While there is no doubt that some of the provisions introduced are well-thought-out, we also need to consider why new laws are needed in the first place. Surely the most important thing would be to introduce measures to ensure we have a higher rate of conviction for rape offenders. Currently, only four percent of those accused of rape are convicted and of these 97 percent later have their sentences reduced or acquitted. This figure means that the current laws do not act as they should. In this situation, it is doubtful whether new measures such as chemical castration, or any such harsher penalties, will in any way be beneficial.

We need to also consider the dichotomy between the laws which exist and the differences between them, with one contradicting the other. These need to be sorted out. And only parliament can achieve this, so that there is a standard acceptable law that reaches across Pakistan and also deals with issues such as child pornography and related matters. The issue of special courts or special investigators is also something that needs to be discussed. In the past, special courts or tribunals have not proved to be very successful. What we need is special police officials who are trained to investigate rape cases using DNA evidence, which is now the standard across the world.

Fortunately, the cabinet has suggested and put in writing an end to the two-finger examination for determining rape, which is humiliating and traumatic for the rape survivor/victim. It is also vital that the new law protect the victim and not hurt her or him further through the processes that are used. Many survivors/victims back away from cases after facing the kind of crude onslaught they come under, and in some cases because of threats made by culprits who may be influential. We also need to think about reform, or restorative justice. And all this must be done keeping in mind that this is a crime of power rather than one of lust.",[],"According to reports that have been reaching the press and the public, the federal cabinet has decided to introduce new laws on rape, gang-rape, and sodomy, which will now also be counted as an offence equivalent to rape through an ordinance.

Fortunately, the cabinet has suggested and put in writing an end to the two-finger examination for determining rape, which is humiliating and traumatic for the rape survivor/victim.","['parliament', 'need', 'provisions', 'cases', 'special', 'rape', 'laws', 'place', 'measures', 'law']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/700X390_thenews.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg,1,FALSE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'Rape laws | Editorial | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'According to reports that have been reaching the press and the public, the federal cabinet has decided to introduce new laws on rape, gang-rape, and sodomy, which will now also be counted as an...', 'keywords': 'rape,laws', 'fb': {'app_id': 650123461797330}, 'og': {'title': 'Rape laws', 'image': {'identifier': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'secure_url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'width': 390}, 'description': 'According to reports that have been reaching the press and the public, the federal cabinet has decided to introduce new laws on rape, gang-rape, and sodomy, which will now also be counted as an...', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/750241-rape-laws', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@thenews_intl', 'creator': '@', 'title': 'Rape laws', 'description': 'According to reports that have been reaching the press and the public, the federal cabinet has decided to introduce new laws on rape, gang-rape, and sodomy, which will now also be counted as an...', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg?t=015759'}, 'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style': 'black-translucent', 'apple-mobile-web-app-title': 'The News International', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#333333', 'theme-color': '#000000'})",[],news
https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/155575-Punishment-despite-compromise-in-honour-killing-cases,,Punishment despite compromise in honour killing cases,"Parliament approves two bills

ISLAMABAD: The joint sitting of both the houses of parliament on Thursday gave approval to women protection bills aimed at increased punishment for people involved in honour killings and making DNA tests mandatory in the rape cases.

Both the bills — the Anti-Honour Killings Laws (Criminal Laws Amendment) Bill, 2016 and Anti-Rape Laws (Criminal Laws Amendment) Bill, 2016 — were moved by Senator Farhatullah Babar in the joint sitting of both the houses of parliament.

One bill relates to amending the honour killing law seeking to curb murders in the name of honour and the other relates to anti-rape laws aimed at punishing rapists by use of modern technology of DNA testing in investigating rape cases.

Both the bills, initially moved by former PPP senator Sughra Imam, were passed unanimously by the Senate sometime back and subsequently moved in the joint sitting of parliament by Farhatullah Babar on the expiry of Sughra Imam’s term in the Senate.

These bills were approved by the parliamentary special committee on bills headed by Law Minister Zahid Hamid that comprised members from both the houses of parliament in July this year.

Under the anti-honour killing bill, the clause giving pardon by family members to the person who kills in the name of honour is to be removed.

Under the Anti-Rape Laws (Criminal Laws Amendment) Bill, 2014, whoever prints or publishes the name or any matter which may make known the identity of any person against whom an offence under Section 376 is alleged or found to have been committed (hereafter in this section referred to as the victim) shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine. The anti-rape bill seeks to make a DNA test compulsory as part of the procedure and investigation in all rape cases.

Similarly, for the first time, anyone hampering the investigation into a rape case will be sentenced to three years imprisonment. Besides, rape of minors, as well as mentally and physically challenged, would become punishable by death. The trial of rape cases would be binding to be completed in three months while the time for appeal in such cases would be four months.

The legislation on honour killings has introduced strict punishment for the convicts making it tougher than the ordinary murder cases. Under the new law, the convict in honour killing cases will have to face life imprisonment even if the relatives of the victims reach an agreement with the convict and pardon him or her. Under the existing law, a murderer can be released after the legal heirs pardon him and on honour killings recommends 25 years imprisonment even if the heirs of the victim pardon the convict.

Moving the bill in the House, Farhatullah Babar said the bill is aimed at preventing killing of women in the name of honour. The religious parties had objected to the bill with an argument to do away with the compoundable clause. But, Farhatullah Babar had argued that Islam never allows killing of anyone with ulterior motives. He said issue of compoundability was not an issue of ideology rather it was a political issue. “The proposed law would be a step forward to stop honour killings as there were shortcomings in the present law,” he added.

Babar said the Anti-Honour Killing Bill was passed by the Senate Committee in 2014 when it was headed by the JUI-F senator. “Subsequently it was passed by the 104-member Senate by consensus including the religious parties,” he added.

He said that under the anti-terror laws, murder was not compoundable and Qisas and Diyat did not apply. Similarly, he said Women Protection Act of 2004 was also excluded from compoundability murders. He said that opposition to exclude from Qisas and Diyat law and to make non-compoundable murders in the name of honour was motivated by politics and not religion. He said it is being opposed simply because it is viewed as women related bill and some of us do not have empathy towards women in the country. “This is not only women related but it also relates to men,” he said.","['Asim Yasin', 'Muhammad Anis']","Under the anti-honour killing bill, the clause giving pardon by family members to the person who kills in the name of honour is to be removed.

The NED University Employees Association staged a sit-in outside the vice chancellor’s office here on Monday, demanding the establishment of a departmental promotion committee and issuance of leave encashment and payment of other allowances.

Employees carrying placards and banners raised slogans against the former administration, declaring them responsible for bringing the university to the brink of bankruptcy.

The protest led by association's senior vice president, Abdul Qadir Gabol, called for the government to address their genuine demands as per the rule and policy of the university and the Higher Education Commission.

Gabol said the university administration had also turned a blind eye to their pleas as despite the press conference they held last month, the employees had not yet received any leave encashment, overtime payment, departmental promotions and house ceiling benefits.

Registrar Gazanfar Hussain issued a letter to all the respective departments of the university where he warned the employees to not associate with the association, otherwise departmental action would follow. The NED administration called Rangers to avoid any untoward situation on the campus. Gabol called it an act of intimidation to harrass the protesters.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/712189-police-stations-in-kp-yet-to-get-financial-autonomy,,Police stations in KP yet to get financial autonomy,"PESHAWAR: Though the provincial government issued a notification in March that declared the station house officers (SHOs) as Drawing and Disbursing Officers (DDOs), no police station has yet been given financial autonomy.

Many junior officers believe that financial autonomy to the SHOs would help improve policing. “Following a notification by the provincial government in March, a number of SHOs applied to be given the DDO powers. Some of them have prepared their own budget. However, the process of giving them financial autonomy is yet to start,” a source told The News.

The source said the post of junior clerks were also advertised to maintain record at the police stations in KP. The federal government last year proposed reforms in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab Police, seeking input from the officials concerned in the two provinces.

Under the proposed reforms, the SHOs were supposed to be given financial autonomy. Presently, the police stations get funds from the police lines. Many junior policemen said the SHOs used to contribute from ‘own resources’ for running the affairs of the police station due to lack of enough funds. The officers believed that a district police head should post an upright and competent cop as SHO and give him financial autonomy to improve law and order in his area.

“When given financial powers and due respect as a responsible officer, seniors can hold the SHO accountable if he doesn’t perform well or if he is found involved in any irregularity or wrongdoing,” said a junior police officer, who has also submitted an application to be given the DDO powers.

The official admitted that some SHOs may face problems in preparing the budget and dealing with other account related issues but the bosses should post the right man for the right job. The provincial police authorities recently asked for an increased budget for fuel for the police stations that get only 10 litre fuel per official vehicle per day for patrolling. Many police stations don’t have enough patrolling cars to cover the entire area.",['Javed Aziz Khan'],"PESHAWAR: Though the provincial government issued a notification in March that declared the station house officers (SHOs) as Drawing and Disbursing Officers (DDOs), no police station has yet been given financial autonomy.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/713367-punjab-law-minister-says-motorway-gang-rape-blind-incident-with-no-evidence,,Motorway gang rape 'blind incident with no evidence': Punjab law minister,"Punjab law minister Raja Basharat addressing the media after surveying the crime scene, on September 11, 2020. — Geo News

Punjab law minister Raja Basharat on Friday said that the motorway gang rape reported earlier this week is a ""blind incident with no evidence"".

The law minister was addressing the media after having surveyed the crime scene on Lahore's Ring Road highway.

Late Wednesday night, a woman was allegedly assaulted, raped and robbed by multiple men in front of her children when her car ran out of fuel outside Lahore, near Gujjarpura.

""This is a blind incident. There is no overt evidence to take the matter forward. We will have to develop the evidence through an investigation and have it corroborated and only then will we be able to get to a point where we can have a concrete picture,"" the law minister said.

He said he ""accepts"" that it is a challenge for the Lahore police, and therefore, is a challenge for the Punjab government.

""Our monitoring committee is reviewing all administrative aspects and we are looking at how we can take the investigation forward,"" Basharat said.

""There is a special committee formed by the IGP which is probing the incident under which about 28 teams are working. They are looking at the case from various angles

""Whatever evidence we could collect from the crime scene we did and the forensic team will present a report soon. The lady's medical tests have also been carried out,"" he added.

At this time the Punjab government and Chief Minister Usman Buzdar's ""total emphasis"" is on apprehending the culprits.

The law minister said that the people's sentiments were high at the moment and so is the government sorrowful over the incident.

""The provincial government is responsible for the safety of our women [...] we will put forward recommendations to the chief minister so that such incidents do not occur in the future.""

He said the Punjab Highway Patrolling Authority was made dysfunctional but now the chief minister has approved the purchase of new cars for the unit and for better patrolling, 500 new cars are being purchased for the police force in general.

Basharat said the people's confidence will be restored when the culprits are brought to justice and ""no one responsible will be able to escape punishment"".

To a question regarding why — even though the motorway has been functional for eight months — motorway police say it hasn't been handed over to them, and how he thinks crime can be controlled when the police station that has jurisdiction is a whole 10 kilometres away, Basharat said the matter is between the National Highway Authority and Frontier Works Organisation.

""We are also examining this aspect of the matter — why there was an ineffective patrolling system. NHA says some work is remaining [...] but this is a separate matter,"" the law minister said.

'Eyewitness' surfaces

Meanwhile, a man claiming to be an eyewitness to the incident, told Geo News via telephone that he ""saw one of the robbers dragging the woman out to the fields"".

""The man was also slapping the woman,"" he claimed, adding that one other man was standing behind her car.

The man said he called the 15 police helpline to inform them of the incident.",[],"Punjab law minister Raja Basharat addressing the media after surveying the crime scene, on September 11, 2020.

—- the pathetic state of Karachi after the heavy rains and how it speaks volumes of the state of the poor governance by the provincial government. People say instead of pointing fingers at the federal government and indulging in petty politics of the blame game, the provincial government should get its act together and solve the problems of the poor citizens who have to live in appalling conditions, surrounded by sewage water and filth while their elected representatives live in comfort.

—- the repeated directives of those in authority that cattle markets will operate under strict SOPs and how this sounds good in the media but is not doable in practice as the general public is not willing to follow guidelines and the governments writ is zero. People say besides the cattle markets, which operate during the day, small herds of cows, goats and even camels are seen at night in remote spots as there are no security personnel to control their influx.

—- how the word ‘demand’ is used by protesters from all sections of society and even the media, instead of using words that have a more appealing sound that does not raise the hackles of the authorities they are protesting against. People say the difference between ‘demand’ and, for instance, ‘request’ or ‘appeal’ makes a world of difference and could lead the authorities to consider the problems of protesters and find a solution, rather than have a standoff or strike.

—- media reports that the NA committee held a meeting to probe into the sale or joint venture option (JVO) of PIA’s Hotel Roosevelt and the confrontation it caused between the government and the opposition. People say it is important that the government of Pakistan wait for the market to stabilise before finalising the JVO, while ensuring that the individual appointed by them to head PIA Investments Limited (PIAIL) is a person of integrity and does not hold any dual nationality to evade accountability.—-

People say the statue was discovered while digging for construction was taking place and the locals took sledgehammers and destroyed a valuable artifact that could have been an additional tourist attraction of Buddhist culture and heritage if it had been preserved.

—- the plan to extend Rawalpindi city and how it does not appeal to old timers who feel the city is already overextended since it first came into being, gobbling up all the arable and scenic land near its precincts and making a concrete jungle of one of the prettiest cities in Pakistan. People say if development of this type was necessary, planning a completely new town in an area where the ground was not useful for growing food would have been a better option. — I.H.",[],"—- the practice of ‘Karo Kari’ - a formal term used for honor killing mainly in Sindh.

Gigi Hadid has unleashed a wave of elation over her fans around the globe after welcoming much-awaited baby girl with Zayn Malik.

The news was confirmed by Zayn Malik on Wednesday.

Taking to Twitter, the singer announced that he and Gigi are parents now!



""Our baby girl is here, healthy & beautiful,"" Malik wrote on Twitter.

""To try put into words how i am feeling right now would be an impossible task,"" the new dad continued. ""The love i feel for this tiny human is beyond my understanding. Grateful to know her, proud to call her mine, & thankful for the life we will have together x""

Gigi also confirmed the same news in an adorable photo she posted on Instagram about her precious baby girl.

Gigi had earlier confirmed she was expecting a baby with Zayn Malik in May. According to sources, the couple was thrilled about their first child.



""They've been through their ups and downs, but neither stopped caring about the other,"" an insider said. ""They've jumped on the timing of having a baby and are preparing for their new lives.""

The on-and-off couple decided to reunite in December last year following a brief split.

Since then, they had been planning to start a family together.

Debuting her baby bump during her pregnancy, Gigi earlier revealed, ""I have been taking a lot of pictures of my bump and sending it to friends and family and it's been really cute and exciting, and I'm trying to document it well because I've heard a lot of people say obviously, 'Make sure you don't miss it,'"" she said.",[],"Gigi Hadid, Zayn Malik blessed with a baby girlGigi Hadid has unleashed a wave of elation over her fans around the globe after welcoming much-awaited baby girl with Zayn Malik.

Political Assistant Jamil Ahmed expressed suspicion that the women had been murdered in what seemed to be a case of honour killing.","['taaro', 'dgk', 'dera', 'zahida', 'officials', 'dead', 'pills', 'ghazi', 'jungle', 'khan', 'women', 'honour', 'killing', 'political', 'poisonous']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/700X390_thenews.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-11/ss_756866_073204_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-11/ss_756867_073745_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'DGK honour killing: Two women found dead in DGK jungle | Pakistan | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'DERA GHAZI KHAN: Two women of a family died after consuming poisonous pills in Dera Ghazi Khan, their in-laws claimed on Sunday, in what local officials suspect to be a case of honour killing....', 'keywords': 'honour,killing,women,dead,jungle', 'fb': {'app_id': 650123461797330}, 'og': {'title': 'DGK honour killing: Two women found dead in DGK jungle', 'image': {'identifier': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'secure_url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'width': 390}, 'description': 'DERA GHAZI KHAN: Two women of a family died after consuming poisonous pills in Dera Ghazi Khan, their in-laws claimed on Sunday, in what local officials suspect to be a case of honour killing....', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/277117-dgk-honour-killing-two-women-found-dead-in-dgk-jungle', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@thenews_intl', 'creator': '@MDMonitoring Desk', 'title': 'DGK honour killing: Two women found dead in DGK jungle', 'description': 'DERA GHAZI KHAN: Two women of a family died after consuming poisonous pills in Dera Ghazi Khan, their in-laws claimed on Sunday, in what local officials suspect to be a case of honour killing....', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg?t=015422'}, 'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style': 'black-translucent', 'apple-mobile-web-app-title': 'The News International', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#333333', 'theme-color': '#000000'})",[],news
https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/199600-Discussion-highlights-need-to-understand-gravity-of-gender-based-violence,,Discussion highlights need to understand gravity of gender-based violence,"While the Provincial Commission on the Status of Women is functioning in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh is yet to establish one; the relevant laws, however, have already been passed.

Addressing the responses to gender-based violence (GBV) in four districts of Sindh, the Strengthening Participatory Organisation (SPO) held a discussion on Wednesday, involving civil society members, government representatives, police officials and others to work together to help women respond to violence.

Being qualitative, the research still has a long way to go because it only recorded the responses of the stakeholders in four districts, namely Karachi, Hyderabad, Jamshoro and Matiari.

SPO’s Atif Sandhu said data collection in districts other than Karachi and Hyderabad was not an easy task because no functional departments catered to women’s issues there. The Women Development Department (WDD) and Darul Aman are yet to make their way to Jamshoro and Matiari.

Talking to officials of the functioning departments revealed that many failed to understand the gravity of GBV and often treated it like any other violent behaviour.

The first responders need to know how to handle such cases, and it should be understood that the absence of a female medico-legal officer can add insult to injury.

Moreover, in some instances, police officials are unaware of relevant laws and file FIRs under other clauses of the Pakistan Penal Code instead of pro-women laws.

WDD respondents, however, identified all forms of GBV and also understood the reasons for such occurrences, owing to tribal cultures and deep-rooted patriarchy.

The condition of Darul Aman is not any better either, as compared to shelter homes under Panah and HANDS, but women do feel safe once they reach the institution. However, Darul Aman representatives did not provide standard operating procedures that would have helped improve the centres.

Panah’s Uzma Noorani said that while it was indeed important to know about the whereabouts of women who leave shelter homes, it was not an easy task because many women tended to cut off all ties with the institution.

Other attendees said that such programmes should be held in places where women have no access to resources, because in cities many have a fair idea about response services.

Aurat Foundation’s Mahnaz Rahman urged that instead of government institutions competing against NGOs or vice versa, they should all work together or else the achievements hitherto made would be futile.

MPA Heer Soho felt that the establishment of three bodies – the Social Welfare Department, the WDD and the Human Rights Department (HRD) – had caused confusion for those who wanted to report cases. “These departments keep referring cases among themselves, which in turn creates hurdles for those who actually want to help the victims.”

She added that while government officials tried to make a difference as individuals, the departments mostly comprising men did not always cooperate with their respective heads.

In response, Chief Minister’s Social Welfare Adviser Shamim Mumtaz said the men working in her department were quite helpful and she had no complaints whatsoever.

Meanwhile, she did not only blame mobile phones for women taking refuge at Darul Aman, but said such institutions should not have been set up at all.

She felt that women fell prey to schemes and stepped out of their houses because of “false promises over the phone”. “Women should be sent home instead of Darul Aman, where their dignity is upheld.”

Detailing the work done in the past nine months, she said the feeding budget for Darul Aman was increased from Rs200,000 to Rs1.7 million. She lamented that the courts needed to expedite the judicial process for women who sought refuge at Darul Aman because those who were sent there on court orders could not go anywhere else without the court’s say-so.

“Many women want to go back home, but they can’t because instead of getting done with such cases in 90 days, the courts extend them up to three years.” Criticising the police, she said it was disappointing that she was unable to file an FIR on behalf of a victim because the SSP refused to do so without an application and proof. She also lashed out at NGOs for not doing their jobs, which should have been done by the government in the first place.

However, Naheed Begum, chairperson of Sindh Assembly’s Standing Committee on Women Development, said there was still a need for shelter homes because women braved violence on a daily basis.

She also pointed out discrepancies in budgeting, saying that Rs202 million were allocated for schemes, of which Rs43 million were released, yet there was no record for the expenditure.

She reiterated that the system could not function if all bodies were not on the same page, because if a harassment case was lodged against a health director, the case could not proceed if the health committee did not present the required reports.

Representing the HRD, Tanveer Ahmed Qureshi said it was high time that all the departments devised victim-centric policies. “It is also important to notice that men make laws concerning women, which itself is problematic because men can’t put themselves in the same position as women.”",['Zoya Anwer'],"The Women Development Department (WDD) and Darul Aman are yet to make their way to Jamshoro and Matiari.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/711783-property-dispute-how-a-faisalabad-lawyer-kidnapped-killed-by-sukkur-police,,"Property dispute: How a Faisalabad lawyer kidnapped, killed by Sukkur Police","KARACHI: In an incident showing police penchant for barbarity, high-handedness and willful disregard for law, the Sukkur police kidnapped a senior lawyer from Faisalabad and tortured him to death in a private torture cell to oblige some influential persons.

According to official documentary evidences of correspondence between the Punjab and Sindh Police, available with this reporter, the murder of Mian Aijaz took place over a property dispute with his stepmother Shamim Bano.

Local police sources said Shamim Bano had migrated to Sukkur after the death of her husband, where she married Mian Asad Indhar, a local, and allegedly set up an ‘illegal business’ in partnership with Indhar, who is stated to be an influential person in Sukkur, having good ties with the local police, politicians, journalists and other notables.

Using his influence, Indhar allegedly got a fake case registered against Mian Aijaz, his wife Aqsa Rasheed and brother-in-law with the connivance of a main police officer of Sukkur in order to arrest and force him to surrender property in favor of his mother Shamim.

According to documentary evidences, the Sukkur Police got all the necessary approvals from the Punjab Home Department through the Sindh Home Department and constituted a special team to materialize the plan. The special team picked up Mian Aijaz from his Faisalabad home on August 17 and shifted him to a private torture cell in the Pano Aqil area of Sukkur. During his illegal detention, Mian Ijaz died from torture after which the Sukkur police allegedly dumped his body in the Bhong area of Sadiqabad – the bordering city of Punjab.

Inspector General of Police (IGP) Sindh Mushtaq Mahar took notice of the incident and directed SSP Sukkur Irfan Samon for an independent investigation. Additional Inspector General Sukkur Kamran Fazal wrote a letter, a copy of which is available with this reporter, to Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sukkur Fida Hussain Mastoi, expressing displeasure over the lawyer’s killing during custody at a private torture cell and dumping of his body at an unknown place to cover up the crime. The DIG was directed to transfer the case investigation to another district.

After the tragic death of Mian Aijaz, Police Station Cantonment, Pano Aqil, registered an FIR on August 23 against Assistant Sub-Inspectors (ASIs) Gul Hassan Seelro and Ghulam Mustafa Mirani and constables Yaqoob, Naseer and Dargah Dino for kidnapping Mian Aijaz from Faisalabad and then keeping him at a private place and torturing him to death. The case was registered on the complaint of SHO Allah Wadayo Pitafi.

The police arrested all the accused, including SHO Bashir Bhayo, and took their remand from a local court; however, Shamim and her two daughters are yet to be arrested.

On the second day of the incident (August 18), Mian Ijaz’s wife Aqsa Rasheed got an FIR registered with Police Station Madina Town, Faisalabad, and nominated Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Masood Rasool Mahar (presently posted as DSP City Sukkur), a few Sindh Police officials and some unknown persons, including two stepsisters, Sobia, Adila, and stepmother Shamim, of the deceased lawyer.

Talking to The News, Aqsa Rasheed said her husband had a property dispute with his stepmother and stepsisters and a court was trying the case. She alleged that by using their influence in the Sukkur police, Shamim and her two daughters, who are now residing in Sukkur, managed the kidnapping-cum-murder of her husband.

Local sources informed this reporter that there was a property dispute between Mian Aijaz and his stepmother and sisters. Shamim’s second husband Mian Asad Indhar allegedly used his influence and got a fake case of theft of jewelry registered with the Police Station Cantonment Pano Aqil against Mian Ijaz on the complaint of his driver. A special police team was constituted to arrest the lawyer and bring him to Sukkur.

The sources said to save the skin of senior officers involved in the incident, the Sukkur police registered a case against some junior officials, who were assured of release after reduction in pressure.

It is pertinent to mention that despite the orders of IGP Sindh and Additional IG Sukkur, the police took no step to arrest the three women despite the fact that they have been nominated in the FIRs lodged in Faisalabad and Sukkur. DSP Masood Mahar told this reporter that Ms Aqsa nominated him in the FIR due to some misunderstanding. Claiming an alibi, Mahar said on the day of incident, he was in the Sindh High Court, Sukkur bench, and in the evening, he attended an official meeting headed by SSP Sukkur.

SSP Irfan Samon told this reporter that the Sukkur police team committed an illegal act by picking up a person in an unauthorized manner and then keeping him at a private place where he died unfortunately. SSP Samon said a case had been registered against the responsible police officials and there would be an impartial investigation against all the involved persons. He said Sukkur police were doing their best to arrest the remaining accused, including the stepmother and stepsisters of the deceased lawyer.

This reporter tried to reach Mian Asad Indhar and Madam Shamim through their cell phone numbers to get their comments but got no response. On the other hand, CPO Faisalabad Muhammad Sohail has written a letter to the RPO informing him about availability of CCTV footages showing a Sindh Police mobile and a private car used in kidnapping of the lawyer.

He recommended that the RPO should contact the Sindh Home department through the Punjab home department to bring the accused for joining a fair investigation by Faisalabad police. On the recommendation of CPO Faisalabad, the Punjab Home Department has approached home secretary Sindh for the handover of the accused to the Punjab Police. In an official letter sent to the home secretary Sindh, a copy of which is available with The News, the IGP Punjab has requested for assistance in the handover of over 10 persons reportedly involved in the kidnapping cum murder of Mian Aijaz.

Sukkur police have arrested all the police officials, excluding DSP Mahar, and sent them to jail on judicial remand. However, to date no effort has been made to arrest Shamim Bano, her two daughters and Mian Asad Indhar.",['Imdad Soomro'],"The special team picked up Mian Aijaz from his Faisalabad home on August 17 and shifted him to a private torture cell in the Pano Aqil area of Sukkur.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/575271-formation-of-parliamentary-committee-against-forced-conversions-lauded,,Formation of parliamentary committee against forced conversions lauded,"While the Pakistan Peoples Party had once again turned down a bill against forced conversions in the Sindh Assembly last month, the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker took an initiative this week to form a parliamentary committee for protection from forced conversions – a move that is being greatly appreciated by civil society and rights groups belonging to minorities.

According to a notification issued by the Senate Secretariat on November 21, the Parliamentary Committee to Protect Minorities from Forced Conversions was formed after consultations with National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser, Leader of the House in the Senate Shibli Faraz and Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Raja Zafarul Haq.

Several civil society and minority rights bodies have welcomed the move and termed it an “encouraging development”. Peter Jacob, executive director of the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ), a civil society organisation, said on Wednesday minority girls in their adolescence had been facing harassment and violence, kidnap and rape under the pretext of conversion.

“We hope that the committee will come up with meaningful recommendations, including the proposals for impending legislation to curb coercive, forced and unethical faith conversions, coinciding with equally detestable marriage of minority women against their will,” Jacob said. “Minority girls in their adolescence have been facing harassment and violence, kidnap and rape under the pretext of conversion to Islam.”

The Peoples Commission for Minorities’ Rights and the CSJ compiled the data of 159 incidents of forced conversions which took place during 2013-2019. The data can be helpful in analyzing the issue. Additionally, 16 girls have approached the Sindh High Court, seeking relief from forced marriages, which are yet another source to look at for solutions.

Jacob said that in Pakistan in general and in Sindh in particular, women and girls belonging to minority groups, particularly Hindu and Christian communities, have faced gender and faith-based criminal manipulation. “The names of perpetrators running the enterprise of forced conversions have been reported by the media. Therefore the law must immediately take its course.”

Krishan Sharma, a minority rights leader associated with Reat Network, also welcomed the formation of the committee and said the parliament was the only and right forum where the issue of forced conversions would be taken up to resolve it through legal means and proper legislation.

“The good thing in the committee is that representation of every political party, province and faith has been ensured,” Sharma told The News. He also criticised the Pakistan Peoples Party for sidelining the bill criminalising forced religious conversions and subsequent forced marriages under the pressure of religious parties.

In November 2016, the Sindh Assembly had unanimously passed the Sindh Criminal Law (Protection of Minorities) Bill 2015 in a bid to prevent and criminalise forced religious conversions and subsequent forced marriages. The bill was moved by Pakistan Muslim League-Functional MPA Nand Kumar Goklani.

Soon after, the PPP leadership succumbed to threats from religious parties, which pressured it to withdraw the bill before it could be ratified by the governor.

Golkani, whose party is now part of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), an alliance comprising opposition parties, tabled the bill again in the Sindh Assembly in October this year. However, the PPP, which enjoyed the majority in the provincial assembly, had given a lukewarm response to a bill condemning forced conversions.

“Golkani has made an amendment in forced conversion bill, but the PPP did not support the bill,” said Sharma, who had led several protests against incidents of forced conversions and for pressuring the Sindh government to resurrect and pass the bill again.

“The party which claims to be the champion of minorities’ rights should stop staging dramas, such as celebrating Hindu festivals, when it is not able to protect minorities from being kidnapped and converted to Islam,” he said.

Pakistan Sikh Council chief Sardar Ramesh Singh also appreciated the joint move of the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker to take the issue of forced conversions seriously and constitute a parliamentary committee in this regard.

“It shows the government’s seriousness towards resolving minorities’ issues and minority groups are ready to provide their assistance to the committee,” Singh said.",['Zia Ur Rehman'],"Several civil society and minority rights bodies have welcomed the move and termed it an “encouraging development”.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/621154-marrying-young,,Marrying young: Impact of early marriages on girls physical and mental growth,"It was heartbreaking to hear Shazia remember the 11 years she was not allowed to meet her mother. When she was finally allowed, the mother did not have long to live. It was because at age 13 or perhaps 14, Shazia was married to a man who was 60 years old at that time and had paid her family Rs60,000 for the transaction with an explicit undertaking that she would not meet her family for 10 years. She remembers the excitement on seeing her sister’s mother-in-law in the city she had moved to and, her subsequent meeting with her brother in a secret meeting. Shazia’s father was not an evil tyrant but he had to give away Shazia to pay for the dowry of his elder daughter, who was being pressured for items beyond their capacity. She says her extremely poor eyesight is a consequence of her constantly crying for her family. The first physical contact with her husband nearly bled her to death, prompting the doctor (who the husband was kind enough to call for a home visit) to prohibit her husband from any further interaction till she healed (two to three months). Shazia’s husband did not force her but, how many child brides are that fortunate?

Child marriage according to global standards is marriage below the age of 18 years. All child marriages are not only illegal because of violation of the minimum age of marriage, but are also forced and hence attract legislative penalties under Section 310-A of the Pakistan Penal Code. 310-A enforces a minimum punishment of 3 years imprisonment and a fine of Rs 500,000 for forcing a female into marriage and there are also penalties for breach of the minimum marriage age of 16 and 18, respectively for boys and girls in the Punjab, the KPK and Balochistan. Sindh has legislated a uniform age of 18 for both girls and boys. An attempt was also made in 2019, led by Senator Sherry Rehman to increase the minimum age of marriage for girls to 18 in ICT but certain political parties blocked the bill.

When poverty-stricken parents receive a generous stipend for their girl’s education, their incentive to marry them off is significantly reduced.

While the law gives the minimum age of 16, there is no real mechanism to confirm the age of the bride due to poor documentation of vital registrations for girls. Their births are not registered in many areas of Pakistan and the abysmal 50 percent literacy rate means that nearly half the women will not even have school certificates to ascertain their age. The law requires the nikah registrar (marriage registration officials) to confirm the age of marriage but lack of documents and social norms prevent the male nikah registrars from checking the bride’s documents or even make a visual guess. Raising the minimum age of marriage for girls to 18 will plug a big hole in this poor implementation of the law, by making CNIC the basis for age verification. Along with legislation raising the age of marriage, we also need to ensure nikah registrars understand the law and their responsibilities. A recent effort by the Punjab government to provide training to nearly 39,000 male nikah registrars demonstrated that 50 percent were not aware of the legislative amendments in 2012 and 2015 and, nearly 70 percent had not received any training/orientation to the law.

Marriage is considered to be a mithaq, a solemn covenant or agreement between husband and wife, and enjoined by The Quran [4:21]. Since no agreement can be reached between parties unless they are able to give free consent, how can minors (those under the age of 18) have the capacity to enter a contract. Unfortunately, despite national laws and international commitments, child/forced marriage remains a real threat for many in Pakistan. According to the Pakistan Demographic and Household Survey (PDHS 2017-18), 8 percent of women age 15-19 are pregnant with the first child or are already mothers. Accurate figures for child marriages are not available due to the practice of verbal marriage solemnization, non-registration and misrepresentation of age at marriage.

Child brides are often expected to bear children soon after marriage, which makes them vulnerable to pregnancy and childbirth related complications. It is recognised that girls who are married between the ages of 10-14 are five times more likely to die in childbirth than women aged 15-19. Child marriage is also the major cause of high maternal mortality ratio of 140 per 100,000 live births (Index mundi). The World Health Organization reports that pregnancy complications remain the leading cause of death among girls aged 15 to 19 in countries with low- and middle-income countries accounting for 99 percent of global maternal deaths of women aged 15–49 years. Babies born to young mothers are also at greater risk: each year about 1 million babies born to adolescent girls die before their first birthday. In developing countries, if a mother is under 18, her baby’s chance of dying during the first year of life is 60 percent higher than a baby born to a mother older than 19. Another very serious consequence associated with early childbirth is obstetric fistula, a condition that causes chronic incontinence and occurs commonly in young girls who give birth before their bodies have matured. It causes constant, uncontrollable leaking of urine or feces, relegating the suffering women to a leper’s life.

Welcome measures of the governments and of the civil society organizations since the past decade to invest in girl’s education and to raise awareness of the harmful consequences of early marriages have led to reduction in the incidence of marriages below the ages of 16. When poverty-stricken parents receive a generous stipend for their girl’s education, their incentive to marry them off is significantly reduced. According to PDHS women with high school education marry 6.2 years later than women with no education

A uniform minimum age of 18 years for marriage of girls and boys will be a step towards promoting girl’s education, physical health and mental wellbeing. Older females are better prepared to take on the responsibilities of wifehood and motherhood. The Quran enjoins to “Do not dogmatically follow the status-quo and tradition; be open to new ideas” (22:1; 26:5; 38:7).

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/752882-shc-orders-simplifying-sops-for-investigating-rape-assault-cases,,"SHC orders simplifying SOPs for investigating rape, assault cases","The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Tuesday directed the prosecution and the police department to simplify the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for dealing with rape and assault cases so that they could be circulated to all the police stations and investigating officers of the province.

The order was issued during the hearing of a petition filed by Kainat Soomro and others seeking the reforming of the investigation process of rape and assault cases.

In the previous hearing, the court had directed the provincial law officer to place the proposed changes in the SOPs before the DIG investigation and then submit the final document in court.

The SHC was informed that the petitioners and the law officer had read the draft of the SOPs, and after making some changes, the final document was submitted in court.

An SHC division bench headed by Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar said that after the perusal of the detailed document, it was found that some of the mentioned aspects were beyond the scope of the SOPs.

The court directed the prosecution and the police department to go through the SOPs and simplify them so that they could be circulated to all the police stations and investigating officers of the province in English, Urdu and Sindhi.

The bench said that copies of the SOPs should be sent to the advocate general and the prosecutor general for their input so that they could be finalised on the next date of hearing.

The bench also issued a notice to the additional secretary of the home department to appear before the SHC on December 17 and apprise it about the government’s efforts for implementing the court’s directives.

According to the petitioners, the Supreme Court had directed the provincial government and other authorities to reform the investigation process of rape cases, but the orders of the top court were not being

complied with.

They said that rape survivors were unable to get justice due to the faulty process of investigation. They asked the court to order the respondents to take immediate steps to improve the investigation system.

A contempt application had been filed against the non-compliance with the court’s directives, following which the court ordered the home department, district & sessions courts and anti-terrorism courts to ensure arrangements for DNA tests, the recording of victims’ statements through teleconference and in-camera trial proceedings in rape and assault cases.

The applicants’ counsel said that on January 31 last year the high court had directed Sindh’s police chief and prosecutor general to ensure proper arrangements for conducting DNA tests and in-camera trials in rape and related cases.

He said the alleged contemnors were deliberately violating the court’s directives, adding that the preservation and testing of DNA evidence was sporadic, unregulated and delayed, while the facilities available for DNA tests continued to be severely limited and dysfunctional.

Citing the example of the Jamna rape case in Sujawal, the counsel said the survivor continued to await her DNA test result despite the passage of four months.

Besides, he added, there had been no progress towards conducting rape trials in camera or after court hours, and even child survivors continued to be forced to face their alleged perpetrators in open courtrooms and had to repeatedly suffer until the evidences were recorded.

He said that the victims and survivors of rape and assault cases continued to suffer through prejudiced investigations and trials and denial of justice, as the orders for making those trials effective and sensitised to the nature of the offence remained unheeded.

The counsel pointed out that so many DNA test reports were awaited due to non-payment of bills of the laboratories concerned. The court was requested to take action against the alleged contemnors for violating the court’s directives.",['Jamal Khurshid'],"The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Tuesday directed the prosecution and the police department to simplify the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for dealing with rape and assault cases so that they could be circulated to all the police stations and investigating officers of the province.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/568581-lessons-safety,,What your children need to know about preventing sexual abuse,"Recent incidents of child abuse have once again triggered the debate on safety and protection of children across the country. While laws and institutional protection need to ensure safety of children at the government level, there are many fronts on which the society needs to come forward. Generating awareness, especially among children, is a matter that often comes up every time an incident of child sexual abuse is reported. Recently, there has been much talk about including components on child safety in school books.

In an interview with The News on Sunday, experts at the Idara e Taleem o Aagahi (ITA), an organisation working to promote education across the country, called on the need for formalising structures and formal educational components on child safety. Experts including Naila Irum, the life skills based education (LSBE) coordinator at ITA; Fatima Jaffar, the project coordinator for Life Skills for Kids (LSK); and Qazi Ehsan, the ITA’s focal person on the technical advisory body made by the School Education Department, Punjab to introduce reforms in curriculum for awareness and prevention of child abuse through LSBE, spoke to us on the subject.

The News on Sunday: There is a lot of talk about the need to generate awareness about child abuse. Are people still reluctant to talk about child sexual abuse?

Naila Irum: Child sexual abuse is still a taboo topic in most of Pakistan. People living in marginalised areas are not even aware about child sexual abuse and its types, mainly because of issues related to ‘honour’. They think their children will be stigmatised for life if they openly talk about it. This is where we need to increase awareness about this pressing issue.

TNS: When we talk about life skills based education (LSBE), there appears to be only a superficial understanding of what it is. So how does LSBE benefit children, especially in terms of generating awareness about sexual abuse?

NI: LSBE is not very difficult to understand. The concept is fairly nascent with no commonly accepted definition. The literature is growing in this area and with increasing incidents of child sexual abuse, people are more and more eager to know about it and how it can help protect their children.

As such LSBE has become an important tool to increase awareness about child sexual abuse. Our LSBE manual has a chapter on child protection for this purpose. The children registered in our LSBE courses are already sensitised about self-protection. They are taught how to deal with such situations, denial (how to say no) and assertiveness. This makes them empowered to take decisions in a vulnerable situation.

TNS: What kind of social pressures and challenges are there in ensuring wider implementation of LSBE given your experience with it?

""The major challenge is the reluctance on part of communities and policy makers to include Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights unit in LSBE manual,"" says Naila Irum.

NI: Idara e Taleem o Aagahi (ITA) has been working on various programs involving LSBE strands like Siyani Sahelian and Life Skills for Kids (LSK) apart from other related trainings and campaigns. Based on our experience with the implementation of such programs, the major challenge comes with the reluctance on part of communities and policy makers to include Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights (SRHR) unit in an LSBE manual. It is difficult to talk about safer child practices with unmarried people. Communities show concern about children getting pre-marital awareness about sexual and reproductive rights. This way we can’t caution them about child marriages and related legislation as this is widely practiced in most backward areas of the country. The LSBE manual is carefully reviewed by the government before they allow us to teach it in schools, and that too implicitly.

TNS: How receptive are parents in the process and how do you engage with those who are reluctant?

NI: Parents mostly show reluctance where they are concerned about security of children because of distant schooling and co-education. With our organisation providing transportation and ensuring free and gender segregated education, parents are quite relieved on these counts. Moreover, since girls’ education is a bigger challenge, we ensure that they will be taught by female staff only. Trust has to be built through social mobilisation.

TNS: Have you gauged the behavioural impact of LSBE on children? How do children benefit from it?

Fatima Jaffar: Life skills include various skills that help a person lead a meaningful life - they teach about group behaviour, anger management, conflict management, negotiation, decision making, problem solving techniques, life protection, health and hygiene and much more. We conduct various counselling and therapeutic sessions for this purpose which help children make life goals. Especially for victims of abuse, it helps them restore their trust and confidence.

There are scales to measure the impact of these sessions which include questions about child behavioural responses over a particular issue they are facing. Their behaviour is assessed through observation and direct flooding. This enables us to see the impact of LSBE and improvement in their behaviours.

TNS: Is there a genuine seriousness towards inclusion of LSBE components in curriculum that could educate children about their own protection? And has there been any progress on that front?

Qazi Ehsan: The inclusion of LSBE in curriculum is important to increase awareness on these issues. In this regard, the School Education Department, Punjab has made a technical advisory committee, including the Punjab Curriculum and Textbook Board (PCTB) and civil society organisations, to introduce reforms in curriculum for the awareness and prevention of child abuse through LSBE.

TNS: Beyond conceptual awareness, what other structures are needed to facilitate programs such as the LSBE on ground?

QE: Unfortunately, despite the massive significance that it carries, LSBE is taken as an extra-curricular subject. Making it a compulsory subject in formal education will be useful as only inclusiveness can help this program become a part of students’ learning, which is going to stay with them for their lives and not just for a certain academic qualification.",[],"Generating awareness, especially among children, is a matter that often comes up every time an incident of child sexual abuse is reported.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/270174-axact-offered-fake-degree-to-bbc-reporter,,Axact offered fake degree to BBC reporter,"LONDON: The BBC journalist who led the investigations into the fake degree mill, Axact, has revealed that he was offered a fake degree in business administration within 10 minutes of his call to the Axact office in Karachi despite the fact that he knew nothing about business.

BBC investigative journalists, Simon Cox, Helen Clifton and Matthew Chapman exposed that Axact from its Karachi office had sold thousands of fake degrees to customers in Britain, including doctors, nurses and engineers.

The report was published on BBC websites (English and Urdu). The report aired on BBC World Service and BBC Radio 4 did a 40-minute programme on the scandal that had affected thousands of Britons.

Simon Cox told The News in an interview that as part of the investigation, Axact offered him a degree from fake online “Nixon University” costing $3,600 within 10 minutes after the BBC reporter called Axact.

“They showed me what it (degree) would look like. They showed me a course I was supposed to have taken. All they wanted to know was my credit card details and then I could get the degree delivered at my doorstep. They kept calling me and they were very persistent. They were concerned about getting money out of me.”

The BBC reporter then got back in touch with the Axact weeks later to tell them that they are not a real university. “They tried to maintain this fiction that they did really exist and that they were in southern California. I kept asking them about the university’s address but they asked me about my address. They wouldn’t own up to the fact they didn’t exist. The first person I spoke to said they were in Washington, DC. The second person said they were in southern California. And when I countered them that they were lying, they said we have branches all over America. So they had an answer for everything.""

The reporter said that the victims included those whose first language was English as well as those with English as second language. Simon Cox said that the BBC reporters spoke to a large number of victims who were duped into buying worthless fake Axact degrees. “We talked to a victim from Israel who paid over $100,000 to Axact. This lawyer figured out that he was being fooled when Axact rang him pretending to be the American Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson. He realised that it couldn’t be true but by now he had paid over $100,000 and they wanted more. They wanted $200,000 from him.”

Simon Cox said that the BBC investigation established that the USA remained the biggest market for Axact, followed by the Gulf Arab countries and Europe.

“We have obtained evidence that Axact sold over 200,000 degrees worldwide. It’s obviously going to be more than that now. We worked on this for a long time, for many months. In fact one of our teams had first worked on a fake degree story ten years ago. What’s interesting about the New York Times and Canadian TV’s expose is that Axact should have been shut down years ago but it's back in business.”

He said that the BBC investigation found that over 3,000 fake degrees were sold in the UK “to various professionals such as doctors, nurses, psychologists and lawyers, people in responsible situations”. He said that most of these professionals had mainly original degrees and they needed “additional degrees” in order to get a promotion. “What was surprising was the scale and the number of the degrees they were selling here, and to the people they were selling to and the amount of money they were making.”

He said it’s easy to dupe the ordinary people who seek help online. “When we told UK’s educational bodies about Axact’s activities in the UK, they were simply not aware Axact was operating again. They are using these loopholes where the UK can’t do anything. Because they will say it’s up to Pakistani authorities or American authorities because they are pretending to be an American university. When someone on phone tells you that you can buy a degree for $3,500 and you don’t have to do any kind of work, you know it’s not a genuine degree.”

The BBC investigative reporter revealed that information about Axact continuing fake degree business came through various documents and sources who told the BBC that the company sold fake degrees through around 500 websites on full time basis.

“We were told that employees pretended to be Saudi ministers and American officials, they pretend to be from American universities. They would pretend anything to sell degrees. We know Axact employee played the part of American Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Another guy said they did fraud regularly and pretended to be politicians trying to fool people.

“We spoke to some people who worked for Axact and told us about how it works and talked about making money. He said a few years ago, Axact realised if you look on those website you see that these are fake universities. So they planned to make money from the people who already bought degrees. And they can keep going back to them again and again. And we have spoken to one victim from the UK who paid $600,000. Another UK victim paid $400,000. There are people in the UK we spoke to who have paid between $40,000 to $50,000 and this is from the initial purchase of fake degrees from maybe $5,000 or $10,000. Axact kept coming back and kept putting pressure on them with threats of shame exposes, deportation or arrests and prosecutions unless more money was paid. The customers paid more.”

Simon Cox said that the BBC based its investigations on a combination of things including looking at the investigation done by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and “looking at a lot of documents, who had bought these degrees, how much they paid, where they were from and insiders who had worked there and knew how it worked, and we saw how they go back again and again and again until these customers had no money left and unless they get as much as they could”.

He said the BBC found that the Axact continued to run fake university sites such as Brooklyn Park University, Neil Wilson University, Nixon University which exist only “online and don’t exist on the ground”.

Simon Cox said that the BBC did a thorough investigation to establish the involvement of Axact in the fraud business. When contacted, Axact told BBC its lawyers would contact the BBC but then no version was given.

The victims told BBC how they were fooled. One victim Cecil Horner, a Briton who worked in Saudi Arabia, paid around $600,000 to Axact and was threatened and blackmailed repeatedly. “He initially paid $1,000, then made 80 more payments in four years and paid $600,000 in total. He was told he would lose his job if he didn’t pay, he would be exposed and he would be shamed that he was holding fake degrees. He was told he could go to jail and deported. It went on and on.

“In this case, they (Axact) drained Cecil Horner, he lost his pension, all his savings, everything. He died two years ago of cancer. Even when he was on his deathbed, they (Axact) were ringing him for more money and they knew he was a sick man and on his deathbed. He worked in Saudi Arabia for 20 years. He kept a secret of what was happening. After he died, his son found emails and fake degrees from Axact. On his deathbed, he was asked to pay more and he paid $50,000. Just before he died.”

He said there had been a case against Axact in Pakistan but the prosecutor had resigned and there had been allegations a judge had been bribed which he denied. “It became very messy and it would be interesting to see if Pakistan investigated Axact again. The FBI in America will be successful but Axact is now weary of American market where it fears FBI agents."" The Axact employee whom this correspondent spoke to said that they would offer him a degree with a seal from the American government and that’s what would get Axact in trouble in America again for selling fake degrees as official American degrees. Action has to happen in Pakistan where Axact is based.

Simon Cox said that there were various counts of how much the Axact could have made in the last 20 years. “The FBI estimates that the Axact has made around $130 million over 10 years but there are bigger estimates, sometime Axact made up to $50 million a year and that means that over a period of 20 years it could have made an estimated $1 billion.”","['Saeed Niazi', 'Wadood Mushtaq']","LONDON: The BBC journalist who led the investigations into the fake degree mill, Axact, has revealed that he was offered a fake degree in business administration within 10 minutes of his call to the Axact office in Karachi despite the fact that he knew nothing about business.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/711043-family-blocks-university-road-for-hours-after-girl-found-raped-and-murdered,,Family blocks University Road for hours after girl found raped and murdered,"Angered residents of the Essa Nagri area in Gulshan-e-Iqbal held an hours-long protest on Sunday on the main University Road, following the recovery of the body of an abducted minor girl who had been killed after being raped.

The culprits had even torched her body so that it could not be identified and dumped it into a vacant plot in the area. Meanwhile, police claimed to have taken one of the neighbours of the victim into custody for his alleged involvement in the abduction, rape and murder of the girl.

The family ended the protest after giving a three-day ultimatum to the government and police and warned of holding another major protest if the real culprits were not traced and arrested within three days.

The minor girl was kidnapped a couple of days ago and her body bearing torture marks was found in the early hours of Sunday near her residence in the Essa Nagri area that falls within the jurisdiction of the PIB Colony police station.

The body was shifted to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre where the initial post-mortem report suggested that the girl had been sexually assaulted and that she had died due to head injuries.

Following the incident, the parents and family members of the victim gathered near Hassan Square at around 12 noon and held a protest on University Road. Later, a large number of their relatives and neighbours also joined the protest. The protesters blocked the flow of traffic for hours from Hassan Square to New Town.

Videos of the protest shared on social media also showed some protesters carrying sticks and asking the commuters to take alternative routes. Police officials tried to persuade the protesters multiple times to end the protest but they did not listen.

The funeral prayers for the victim were also offered during the protest after Zuhr prayers. She was then laid to rest at a graveyard in Baldia Town. The protest, however, continued after the funeral prayers and burial.

The victim’s paternal uncle told the media that the girl’s father was a rickshaw driver. He added that his five-year-old niece was kidnapped near her residence on Friday at around 7am when she had left her home to buy biscuits from a nearby shop and since then her whereabouts had been unknown until her body was found in a garbage dump in a plot.

The uncle explained that unidentified persons had first kidnapped her and then murdered her after subjecting her to rape. Later, they set her body on fire so that she could not be identified.

A heavy contingent of the law enforcers, including police and the Rangers, reached the protest site to pacify the protesters. They held negotiations with the girl’s family and assured them of their full cooperation.

Police also told the protesters that they had arrested a suspect, Nawaz, for his alleged involvement in the incident. According to PIB Colony SHO Shakir Hsusain, the suspect’s DNA samples had been sent to a laboratory in the University of Karachi to ascertain his involvement in the crime.

The officer said police were recording the statements of the girl’s family members, relatives and neighbours and they were also trying to obtain CCTV footage. The protesters dispersed at 6pm in the evening after the law enforcers held successful negotiations with them. They, however, gave a three-day deadline to the government and police to arrest the real culprits. A case has been registered and further investigations are under way.",['Faraz Khan'],"Angered residents of the Essa Nagri area in Gulshan-e-Iqbal held an hours-long protest on Sunday on the main University Road, following the recovery of the body of an abducted minor girl who had been killed after being raped.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/476775-government-urged-to-establish-special-police-unit-to-tackle-child-abuse-cases,,Government urged to establish special police unit to tackle child abuse cases,"Islamabad : In order to tackle the increasing number of child abuse and gender based violence cases in the country, the government shall establish a special unit in the police department.

The suggestion was shared by the Chairperson National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) Khawar Mumtaz in an interview with ‘The News’. She also suggested better connection, coordination and monitoring of the mechanisms created by the government and private organizations to provide relief to the victims of gender based violence and child abuse.

Khawar also called for a consolidated helpline instead of different helplines created by departments responsible for providing relief to the survivors of victim’s families and highlighted the need for training and sensitization of police force to deal with such cases.

“We have comprehensive laws and people are reporting these cases in the police. Now the problem is the implementation of these laws and the behaviour and approach of the departments responsible for providing justice to the victims,” she said.

Citing the example of Farishtay’s case, Khawar said that the family came to police station for justice but the FIR was registered with the delay of four days and the father of the girl was asked to clean the police station. “This shows the insensitivity of the law enforcers towards such cases. If this is the approach in the capital, what can we expect in other parts of the country?”

She said that it is the responsibility of the law enforcing agencies to register the case under right clauses, behave with victims with right sensitivity, perform basic procedures such as medico legal and provide efficient legal aid to the victims. “This is where the system fails those who dare to stand for their rights and register the cases.”

Talking about the role of parents, she agreed that parents need to inform children about the likely dangers but said that they could not hide children at homes. “In most cases, the perpetrators of child sexual abuse are relatives or family friends. Ultimately, it the state that is responsible of providing the safe environment for everyone by enforcing the law and creating fear of punishment for the criminals,” said the Chairperson while also stressing for basic skills training in schools so that children identify the abusers and can protect themselves from that person.

Khawar Mumtaz also called for collection of data on child sexual abuse and gender based violence so that targeted strategies can be developed matching the need of a specific area. She termed social mindset the biggest barrier in way of providing justice to the victims of child sexual abuse and gender based violence.

“Unfortunately, the same social mindset considers abuse and violence against the weaker segments of the society as a less important issue as compared to security and politics. But for the family that passes through this torture, it is the end of the world and they look towards the state for justice.”",['Myra Imran'],"Islamabad : In order to tackle the increasing number of child abuse and gender based violence cases in the country, the government shall establish a special unit in the police department.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/683583-trump-s-war,,Trump’s war,"President Donald Trump chose a national holiday traditionally intended for joy and unity to deliver dark, combative harangues against a “radical ideology” that is no more than “violent mayhem” designed to overthrow law and order.

In speeches at Mount Rushmore on Friday evening and on the South Lawn of the White House Saturday to commemorate America’s 244th birthday, Trump minced no words and stayed true to form in appealing to his conservative and white supremacist base by making clear he was taking sides in a burgeoning culture war between honoring a past scarred with racism and civil war and a “new far-left fascism” that seeks a future of social justice free of inequality. He couldn’t have been more divisive.

“Their goal is not a better America. Their goal is the end of America,” he said of demonstrators demanding social justice reforms of police departments nationwide, among them the Black Lives Matter movement.

Trump appealed to his few thousand admirers Friday in an amphitheater beneath the carved busts of four presidents in the Black Hills of South Dakota to honor the monuments and statues saluting America’s past, shunning the fervor of the present in which millions of Americans have marched for their country to bring alive the ideals invoked in sacred documents that have guided American jurisprudence and for which Americans have died from the green fields of Lexington and Concord to the bloodied sands of Iraq and Afghanistan.

“The radical ideology attacking our country advances under the banner of social justice,” Trump said. “But in truth, it would abolish both justice and society. It would transform justice into an instrument of division and vengeance and turn our free society into a place of repression, domination and exclusion. They want to silence us, but we will not be silenced.”

That’s most of what Trump has been doing for 3.5 years.

He is seeking reelection against a growing tide of what Trump branded a “left-wing cultural revolution” that has toppled statues of Confederate generals, slave owners and even of Columbus in a quest for recognition of the need for racial justice. He condemned a social movement that since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis May 25 has pushed for an end to police brutality against Blacks and other minorities.

Most of the demonstrations have been peaceful but Trump inflated their impact, making it sound as if protesters were rampaging through cities on a wave of destruction that he characterized as “violent mayhem.”

“Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values and indoctrinate our children,” he told the crowd in which few wore masks or practiced social distancing. “Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders, deface our most sacred memorials and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities.”

Trump recently signed an executive order to punish people who destroy monuments on federal property.

His racism is well known by now, from his saying there are “very fine people on both sides” at the white supremacist demonstration in Charlottesville in 2017 in which one woman was killed to his condemnation of

Black football players for kneeling during the national anthem that cost one his career.

But the protests for change may be inspiring Americans more than Trump and his fellow Republicans may realize, creating more of a backlash to the president’s policies, including his refusal to take charge of the pandemic, leaving it to governors and mayors, and calling on the military to suppress demonstrations in Washington, DC, and elsewhere.

Civics Analytics, a data company whose clients include Democratic campaigns, released four recent polls that indicate between 15 million to 26 million Americans have participated in demonstrations over Floyd’s killing, The New York Times reported Saturday. Further, 500,000 people staged protests in nearly 550 locations countrywide on June 6.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/293278-four-men-involved-in-gang-rapes-blackmail-sent-on-judicial-remand,,"Four men involved in gang rapes, blackmail sent on judicial remand","A gang of four men involved in the gang rapes and blackmail of multiple women were sent to prison on judicial remand on Friday after they were produced in court by the police.

The four suspects – Daniyal Ahmed Solangi, Afaq Ahmed, Asad Khan Niazi and Ghufran Mirza – were arrested from Samanabad on Thursday night in an intelligence-based raid conducted in a public park.

The investigation officer produced them in the court of the judicial magistrate (Central) on Friday and said that illegal weapons including a sub-machine gun and two pistols were seized from them, while illicit videos were also found on their phones, which disclosed that they had been involved in the gang rapes and blackmail of several women.

According to the IO, during interrogation, Ghufran Mirza, one of the accused, confessed in a video statement that they have been involved in rape and other criminal activities. Mirza claimed that one of them is the maternal grandson of a politician, another is a doctor and one was the son of a bus conductor, the IO said.

He added that Mirza had confessed to raping a girl. He prayed to the court to grant physical remand of the four accused to police for further interrogation. The judge, however, declined the plea and ordered the suspects to be sent on judicial remand to a prison till March 28.

At the moment, the suspects have been charged with illegal weapons possession since the rape victims and their families have been hesitant to lodge a complaint.

Police action

Speaking to The News, District Central SSP Dr Rizwan Ahmed said that they came to know about the gang when the father of one of the rape victims approached them almost a week ago.

According to the SSP, the father did not want to put his or his daughter’s name in a formal complaint, but told them that a man had befriended his daughter on social media and later asked her to come meet him.

But when she went to see him, he and his friends gang-raped her and made a video of the crime. Since then, they had been blackmailing her. Ahmed said police launched an inquiry to find the man who had been identified by the victim’s father. Through his social media account, police was able to trace him and then arrested him. Once in custody, he gave the names of his three friends who had been involved in the crimes with him.

“Since the complainant wanted his and his daughter’s identity to be kept undisclosed, police have registered a case against the arrested suspects on behalf of the state,” the SSP added. Amir Azam, the SHO of Samanabad police station, told The News that two of the suspects were residents of Azizabad and two others lived in DHA.

Speaking about the modus operandi of the gang, the SHO said one of them would befriend a girl on social media and ask her to meet him. When she arrived at the set location, he and his friends would then rape her and film it. They did this to several women and would use the videos to blackmail them for more sexual assaults.

The policeman added that the suspects used farmhouses and a rented apartment in Nazimabad for their illicit activities. Several videos were found in their mobile phones, emails and on social media accounts.",[],"A gang of four men involved in the gang rapes and blackmail of multiple women were sent to prison on judicial remand on Friday after they were produced in court by the police.
