By our correspondent

SUKKUR: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Vice President and leader of the parliamentary party in Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh on Friday demanded justice for a victim of gang-rape in Jati, district Sujawal.

The victim, Aisha Thaimor, was kidnapped and kept in illegal detention in Jati, district Sujawal, for 10 days and she was subjected to gang-rape. The police allegedly only lodged a case against three of the five suspects after extracting Rs140,000 from the victim’s father.

PTI MPA Haleem Adil visited the victim’s house in Jati and assured her family of full medical and legal assistance. Demanding justice, he asked the police to quickly round up all the five suspects. He strongly criticized the law enforcement agency for extorting Rs140,000 from the victim’s father to file the FIR and that too by ignoring the names of two suspects. He pledged to arrange proper medical treatment and cash assistance of Rs25,000 from the Pakistan Baitul Mal.",[],"The victim, Aisha Thaimor, was kidnapped and kept in illegal detention in Jati, district Sujawal, for 10 days and she was subjected to gang-rape.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/576109-small-steps-towards-women-rights,,Pakistan and violence against women: Small steps towards rights,"Even a brief flashback to some of the atrocities and violence women in Pakistan have been subjected to presents a shameful montage: lashed in public over suspicion of zina (Swat in 2009), gang raped on a jirga’s orders (Mukhtaran Mai), killed for dancing at a wedding (Kohistan), private parts burned by husband (Zainab in the early 90s), burnt alive on suspicion of blasphemy (pregnant Shama along with her husband), rape and murder of girl children — from Zainab Ansari to the recent cases of a 7-year old in Rawalpindi and a 4-year old in Mansehra.

Each year November 25 marks the UN-designated International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. The commemoration and related activities continue with their culmination on International Human Rights Day on December 10. It is heartening to note the increasing participation of men in many parts of the world, signifying both greater awareness and a growing commitment to putting a stop to violence against women. Yet, worldwide, the statistics on domestic physical and sexual abuse, trafficking of women, as well as denial of bodily rights continue to be alarming.

The sixteen days of activism largely go unnoticed in Pakistan apart from scant media coverage of token events and some suitable statements. So, what does the report card on Pakistan look like?

If it were to be given a grade, it would doubtless be an ‘F’. An opinion poll by Thomas Reuters Foundation in 2018 ranked Pakistan sixth (as compared to third in 2011) in its list of the world’s ten most dangerous countries for women. This is not because the status and safety of Pakistan’s women have improved but because they have deteriorated elsewhere for women, particularly in countries suffering from civil war. In 2018, India was ranked as number one on account of violence against women which has seen a sharp rise after the coming into power of the right-wing BJP government.

In Pakistan, apart from a weak response from those in power to each incident of violence against women, a sheer negligent attitude is visible towards institutions that stand as protectors of women’s rights as well as human rights. The position of chairperson of the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) remains vacant after the end of term of the last chairperson, Khawar Mumtaz.



An opinion poll by Thomas Reuters Foundation in 2018 ranked Pakistan sixth (as compared to third in 2011) in its list of the world’s ten most dangerous countries for women. This is not because the status and safety of Pakistan’s women have improved but because they have deteriorated elsewhere for women, particularly in countries suffering from civil wa r

Even more disturbing is the apathetic attitude towards the National Human Rights Commission, which has been without a chairperson and other office-bearers since May this year. Both institutions, though headed by those selected by the government in power, have done commendable work in protecting the rights of the vulnerable and have acted independently— sometimes to the government’s discomfiture. Surprisingly, all political governments have, so far, allowed both these commissions to work without much interference; however, funding and general support have been minimal. Of course, the stature of those heading or representing these commissions has also contributed to their autonomy.



In terms of legislation, Pakistan’s parliament has done fairly well over the past decade or so. Several significant laws were enacted by the PPP-led government that came into power in 2008 to ensure greater protection for women’s rights. These include laws covering sexual harassment at workplace acid attacks as well as ending customary and harmful practices affecting women.

The PML-N government that succeeded made a crucial amendment in laws regarding honour killings, making the state a party and ruling out settlements based on ‘forgiveness’. This was one positive outcome that came of the much-publicised and gruesome case of the killing of social media star, Qandeel Baloch. Moreover, all the provincial assemblies, with the exception of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, have passed laws against domestic violence.

The last KP Assembly, inexplicably, sent the draft law to the Council of Islamic Ideology for review and the matter rests there. Currently, certain bills covering issues from child abuse to forced conversions are pending in the parliament. In another positive development, the Sindh Assembly raised the minimum age of marriage to eighteen, which should lead to an end to child marriage.

However, laws are just the first step in the process of meaningful change. They are certainly an expression of intention. But the true test lies in enforcement of these laws. Often rules are not framed for implementation and obstacles soon emerge. The yawning gap between lawmakers and the administration on the ground, tasked with enforcement of laws, becomes clearly discernible. Legislators appear to be under the impression that their job is done with the passing of laws. However, that is just the beginning of ownership and responsibility for the government of the day as well as members of parliament who can certainly contribute to creating awareness about pro-women laws in their own constituencies. There is also an urgent need for gender sensitization of those responsible for enforcement and interpretation at the local level – including law enforcers and the lower judiciary.

Crimes against women have not decreased with the introduction of laws. While cases of honour killings have come down from over a 1000 each year to about 400, incidents of rape show a disturbing rise annually (going by official statistics). Rape and killing of girl children are becoming common and the fear is that after a while these crimes will fail to shock.

The status of women in Pakistan — and their vulnerability — are deeply rooted in patriarchy. It will take social change over decades, perhaps, to improve the situation. However, long-term commitment to women’s rights by our rulers and the political will are useful starting points.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/293278-four-men-involved-in-gang-rapes-blackmail-sent-on-judicial-remand,,"Four men involved in gang rapes, blackmail sent on judicial remand","A gang of four men involved in the gang rapes and blackmail of multiple women were sent to prison on judicial remand on Friday after they were produced in court by the police.

The four suspects – Daniyal Ahmed Solangi, Afaq Ahmed, Asad Khan Niazi and Ghufran Mirza – were arrested from Samanabad on Thursday night in an intelligence-based raid conducted in a public park.

The investigation officer produced them in the court of the judicial magistrate (Central) on Friday and said that illegal weapons including a sub-machine gun and two pistols were seized from them, while illicit videos were also found on their phones, which disclosed that they had been involved in the gang rapes and blackmail of several women.

According to the IO, during interrogation, Ghufran Mirza, one of the accused, confessed in a video statement that they have been involved in rape and other criminal activities. Mirza claimed that one of them is the maternal grandson of a politician, another is a doctor and one was the son of a bus conductor, the IO said.

He added that Mirza had confessed to raping a girl. He prayed to the court to grant physical remand of the four accused to police for further interrogation. The judge, however, declined the plea and ordered the suspects to be sent on judicial remand to a prison till March 28.

At the moment, the suspects have been charged with illegal weapons possession since the rape victims and their families have been hesitant to lodge a complaint.

Police action

Speaking to The News, District Central SSP Dr Rizwan Ahmed said that they came to know about the gang when the father of one of the rape victims approached them almost a week ago.

According to the SSP, the father did not want to put his or his daughter’s name in a formal complaint, but told them that a man had befriended his daughter on social media and later asked her to come meet him.

But when she went to see him, he and his friends gang-raped her and made a video of the crime. Since then, they had been blackmailing her. Ahmed said police launched an inquiry to find the man who had been identified by the victim’s father. Through his social media account, police was able to trace him and then arrested him. Once in custody, he gave the names of his three friends who had been involved in the crimes with him.

“Since the complainant wanted his and his daughter’s identity to be kept undisclosed, police have registered a case against the arrested suspects on behalf of the state,” the SSP added. Amir Azam, the SHO of Samanabad police station, told The News that two of the suspects were residents of Azizabad and two others lived in DHA.

Speaking about the modus operandi of the gang, the SHO said one of them would befriend a girl on social media and ask her to meet him. When she arrived at the set location, he and his friends would then rape her and film it. They did this to several women and would use the videos to blackmail them for more sexual assaults.

The policeman added that the suspects used farmhouses and a rented apartment in Nazimabad for their illicit activities. Several videos were found in their mobile phones, emails and on social media accounts.",[],"A gang of four men involved in the gang rapes and blackmail of multiple women were sent to prison on judicial remand on Friday after they were produced in court by the police.

ISLAMABAD: A draft position paper on police reforms has been prepared by Pakistan's Sustainable Social Development Organization (SSDO), in collaboration with the United States Institute for Peace (USIP), aimed at more effective legislation and capacity building of the law enforcement department.

Prepared in consultation with police officers as the pilot project of ""Police Awam Saath Saath (PASS),"" the draft position paper would be presented to senators and members of the assemblies. A news release issued Sunday said it contained recommendations of parliamentary groups.

Four parliamentary groups, comprising members from National Assembly and Senate, as well as the provincial assemblies of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, and Punjab, were formed to bring reforms in the police department by introducing modern research mechanisms and necessary legislation.

Mobilising lawmakers for the institutional reforms were vital for a more vibrant judicial system, which had a key role in ensuring the rule of law in Pakistan.

The paper suggested urgent ""strategic initiatives"" to further improve law and order besides the prevention of incidents of violence at different levels.

Moreover, it underlined the difference between 'police reforms' and 'policing reforms,' noting that the former were linked to the department's organisational aspects, while the latter related to functions or service delivery aspects, such as case registration, investigation methods, bail and remand laws, trial procedures, and handling of offenders and juveniles.

The service delivery issues discussed in the paper focused on the topics of women in police, investigation, community policing, and information technology in police.

Parliamentarians' recommendations about the 'women in police' section were mostly about categorising women officials in the police department and crimes against women. They asked to ensure that women working at police stations were functional units of law enforcement agencies, with increased induction of staff, as well as retention and training of women officials in the department.

Women parliamentarians strongly recommended that crimes against women should be professionally measured through investigation by women police officers as it would help minimise communication gap and increase empathy.

They also asked for increased coordination for evidence collection to carve out strategies in order to deal with criminals through reliable databases.

The draft paper also stressed on functional specialisation, renewal of investigation resources and methods alongside accountability for defective investigation, standardisation, evidence-based arrests, police prosecution, and forensic cooperation.

The parliamentarians stressed for the recorded, rule-based management of cases, only to be conducted and supervised by investigators rigorously trained in police investigation, forensic, human rights compliance, and legal matters.

They asked to develop a separate and specialised investigation wing of police stations to ensure more focused investigative measures to provide relief to the victims.

The parliamentarians called for increasing the investigation budget, decentralisation, as well as a professional audit to make disbursements easy and transparent.

They said police should be bound only to make evidence-based arrests with few exceptions, which would result in lessening the judiciary’s burden and improve investigation quality with better conviction rate in cases sent for prosecution.

Community policing, the recommendations said, must be institutionalised through a clear and rule-based mandate and a system for selection and removal, tenure to ward off any political, and personal considerations, besides compatibility through integrating initiatives into the larger criminal justice system.

The paper recommended moving from digitisation to digitalisation, declaring the primacy of electronic evidence relevant and admissible under the law of evidence, as well as ensuring cyber security and data privacy for citizens’ dignity and integrity of police organisation.

""The development of this document has been a great learning for us from its conception to completion,” SSDO Executive Director Syed Kausar Abbas said, expressing gratitude to legislators, police officers, and the District Management Group (DMG) personnel for timely and relevant recommendations.

""With this brief situation analysis, the overall state of the public sector with regards to peace and security requires much to be done.""",[],"APP/Syed Abbas Mehdi/FilesISLAMABAD: A draft position paper on police reforms has been prepared by Pakistan's Sustainable Social Development Organization (SSDO), in collaboration with the United States Institute for Peace (USIP), aimed at more effective legislation and capacity building of the law enforcement department.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/281907-bajwa-doctrine-working-well-against-american-blackmail,,‘Bajwa Doctrine’ working well against American blackmail,"LONDON: Leading British security think-tank Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) has said in an analysis that Pakistan army under “Bajwa Doctrine” is biting back hard against threats issued by the American administration and far more confident than it was when the Americans threatened its then President, General Musharraf, to bomb Pakistan into the stone age if it didn’t comply with American demands.



The RUSI said in the report published yesterday that the USA is making the same threats that it did from George W Bush till now but “gone are the days of timidity and scurrying to please the Americans” and this is being called the “Bajwa Doctrine” which suggests that the Pakistan Army should not do more, but rather the world must do more.

It said that Pakistan army is now “battle-hardened after 17 years of war on its western frontier and regular skirmishes on its eastern border” and the world, in the shape of China, Russia, Turkey and Iran, have all come to Pakistan’s defence as America loses influence in Islamabad. “Pakistan is now adamant that the time for American threats and directives is over.”

Written by Kamal Alam, RUSI’s expert on Pakistan and Middle East, the report said that Milt Bearden, a former station chief in Islamabad who along with Congressman Charlie Wilson ran the covert war from Pakistan to fight the Soviets in the 1980s, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have said that its wrong to blame Pakistan alone for Afghanistan problems and while in Donald Trump’s administration there’s no tolerance for Pakistan, General Bajwa has clearly stated even before Trump’s tweet that the time for Pakistan to do more has come to an end.

The report noted that the US administration has made a mistake by confusing General Bajwa with Pervez Musharraf who buckled under pressure and responded to all of the American requests and threats. The report quoted several former officers, who were in service at the time of ‘war on terror’, as saying that Pakistan delivered everything it promised on Afghanistan but the US President’s policy tweet on Pakistan and the follow-up by the US government appeared to be a departure from reality. It said that the Turkish President, Chinese and Japanese Foreign Ministers had all made their support for Pakistan’s counterterrorism effort well known.

Said the report: “The Pakistani military is fully prepared to face any cuts in US military aid and potential threats of cross border incursions by American forces and feels its global recognition and reputation of its counter terror efforts and the military’s role is very different to what it was in 2001. Days after Trump announced the freezing of aid, Pakistan announced it would trade in the Chinese Yuan, amidst reports that China was getting ready to open a naval base in Pakistan, its second overseas military base after Djibouti. The Pakistani military has made it clear that will do no more than it has already done. According to the COAS, Pakistan must defend its borders and has already played its hand in regional peace. As 2018 begins, it is the Americans that need Pakistan and not the other way around. US Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis has already said that he is in touch with the Pakistani military, as without them the US forces cannot move their equipment or survive in landlocked Afghanistan. If anything, Trump’s tweet has made Pakistan realize it has been wrong to trust American for seven decades. The Pakistanis have given full combat and logistical support to a war for which America has no answers.”

The RUSI report said that while there has been a downward trajectory of US aid to Pakistan, the Trump factor coupled with the threat of aid cuts seems to be a flash in the pan.

“The message from the military is quite clear – US equipment is no longer the only option for Pakistan. In fact, Pakistan is actively buying hardware and producing more with China. As far as US military aid goes, the words of the Pakistani Army’s spokesperson Major-General Asif Ghafoors sums up Pakistan’s perspective, ‘Pakistan never fought for money but for peace’. The Pakistani military leadership’s message is clear, that the Army has restored Pakistan’s stability. Afghanistan’s stability is the responsibility of the Afghan government and US forces. In fact, the US still completely relies on Pakistani assistance for logistics and complete usage of airspace for its forces. The report quoted leading American generals and officers who said that without Pakistan the war on terror would not have been won after 9/11. It was Pakistan that helped militarily more than any other NATO country. The future, as far as the Pakistan Army is concerned, belongs to them,” concluded the report.",[],"The Pakistani military has made it clear that will do no more than it has already done.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/504637-research-centre-to-be-established-to-help-judges-cjp,,Research centre to be established to help judges: CJP,"LAHORE: The Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP), Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, has said the Constitution of the country provides equal rights to all citizens.

The CJP said this while addressing the closing session of the second workshop on gender-based violence laws held in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank at the Punjab Judicial Academy here on Saturday. He said steps were taken to protect the rights of citizens and establishment of the gender-based violence courts was one of those steps. ""Our first step is against fake evidence and witnesses and cases against such elements were being proceeded in various courts"", he added.

The CJP said the second step is to enhance the capacity building of judges and “we are thankful to the Punjab Judicial Academy which is standing with us in achieving this goal”.

He said police reforms are the third step aimed at welfare of masses and effective steps are being taken in this regard. The top judge said a committee of nine judges has been formed to introduce reforms in police system. He said the committee would work for the better image of police in the eyes of public. He said the next step is setting up of police assessment committees comprising retired sessions judges and lawyers. The CJP said with these initiatives, there was an 11 per cent reduction in filing of new cases in district courts besides 20 per cent reduction in the higher courts.

Each court is being linked with research centre to enhance the capacity building of the courts, he maintained. Justice Khosa said artificial intelligence would bring revolution in “our judiciary and the decision of cases would be made in lesser time”. He said a modern research centre would be established to help judges in provision of speedy justice. He said the facility of voice typing would also be provided to judges.

He said most of eyewitnesses gave wrong testimonies in murder cases, adding that an example should be set while punishing those who gave wrong testimony. He said cases are in progress in different courts against those who gave false testimony. He said: “We are providing standard education to young lawyers and investigators.”

The CJP said 10,600 cases of murder and narcotics were completed in criminal model courts established across the country. The CJP said there is a need of passion to work for people’s welfare and added that Article 10 of the Constitution gave a right of fair trial to all the citizens.

The Supreme Court Justice, Syed Mansoor Ali Shah. said: “Gender-based violence is a very horrible aspect of our society. We have studied this aspect in detail with the collaboration of the Asian Development Bank.” He said the journey which was started from a district and a court now has spread across all the districts of the country.

The Lahore High Court (LHC) Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Shamim Khan said it was need of the hour to make collective efforts to check gender-based violence. He said Islamic basic rights and laws have special position in all laws and rights of the world. He lauded the services of the Punjab Judicial Academy for holding such a good workshop and thanked the Asian Development Bank for their collaboration.",[],"He said steps were taken to protect the rights of citizens and establishment of the gender-based violence courts was one of those steps.

GUJRANWALA: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) said Sunday they have arrested a man who allegedly blackmailed children into sending sexually explicit videos by befriending them through online games, such as PUBG and 8 Ball Pool.

Following an operation in Jamshoro, the deputy director of the FIA's Cyber Crime Wing, Mohammad Iqbal, said several pornographic and sexually explicit videos were recovered from the suspect during the raid.

A first information report (FIR) has been registered against him as well, he added, noting that the suspect used to befriend children through PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, an online battle royale game popularly known as PUBG, and multiplayer video game 8 Ball Pool.

The FIA official said the suspect also used to solicit sexually explicit videos from children by luring them in with offers of giving them PUBG's in-game currency, G-Coins.

""In the past, the culprit had forced some children into sending him videos of their families, after which he would blackmail them,"" he added.

According to Iqbal, the parents of one of the children had earlier submitted a request to investigate the matter and register a case against the suspect. He added that the alleged paedophile has cyber-abused and threatened children from Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Punjab along with their families.

The criminal investigation and cybercrime agency was investigating the sale of pornographic videos by the suspect as well, Iqbal stated.

Earlier this week, another Pakistani man from Punjab was arrested for allegedly sharing and owning sexually-explicit videos of children after Brazil — through the help of the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) — shared documents and other evidence linking him to an international child pornography ring.

The man, identified as Riaz, a resident of Narowal, was in possession of more than 600 sexually-explicit videos of children, according to the FIA's Cyber Crime Wing in Gujranwala. He was working for a global child sex abuse ring, it added.

The man's laptop and other devices were sent for forensic testing and a case filed against him.",[],"Unsplash/Mark Cruz/via The NewsGUJRANWALA: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) said Sunday they have arrested a man who allegedly blackmailed children into sending sexually explicit videos by befriending them through online games, such as PUBG and 8 Ball Pool.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/714258-lahore-motorway-gang-rape-one-of-two-suspects-surrenders-other-still-at-large,,"Lahore motorway gang-rape: One of two suspects surrenders, other still at large","LAHORE: One of the two suspects in the motorway gang rape case on Sunday surrendered before the police, denying involvement in a highway incident that has angered the entire nation and sparked protests across Pakistan.

Geo News reported citing sources that Waqarul Hassan surrendered to the Lahore police today at the Model Town police station under pressure from his relatives and told the investigators that he was not involved in the motorway case.

However, the key suspect the government of Punjab had identified on Saturday, Abid Ali, is still at large and police teams were conducting raids at different locations to apprehend him.



Waqar claimed that his brother-in-law, Abbas, was using his mobile phone.



""Abbas refused to surrender himself with me but he may do soon. He was involved in some criminal activities with Abid Ali and is still in contact with him,"" Waqar reportedly told police.

Claiming innocence in the gang rape, he asked the officials to get his DNA test done.

Parents' appeal to authorities

Meanwhile, speaking to Geo News, Waqar's mother said that her son is ""innocent"" and that he decided to surrender himself after he got to know of the incident.

""If my son had done something wrong, he wouldn't have surrended himself,"" she said.

The suspect's mother appealed to Chief Minister Usman Buzdar to ensure justice is served in Waqar's case.

""My son is a pious and religious person, his life should be spared,"" she said, adding: ""He runs a motorcycle repairing shop in Qilla Sattar Shah.""

""If my son was a culprit, why would he present himself [to the law enforcement agencies],"" she asked.

The mother said that she has four daughters and two sons and one of her sons was ill.

Meanwhile, Waqar's father said that his son is not a ""thief"" and ""works at a shop"".

He said Waqar is ""innocent"" and appealed to the authorities to release him.

Rs2.5 million reward

On Saturday, Chief Minister Punjab Usman Buzdar had announced a reward of Rs2.5 million for each of the suspects if information leading to their arrest is shared. He said that the identity of those bringing forward any information will be kept confidential.

""We worked day and night and launched a probe using scientific techniques. I personally monitored the progress and directed the completion of the probe expediently,"" Buzdar had said.

According to the chief minister, seven cases — including two gang-rape cases — were registered against Abid, while two robbery cases were filed against Waqar who was released 14 days earlier on bail.

Buzdar said that the culprits will be given exemplary punishment for the heinous crime.

While briefing the media about how the police identified the suspects, Inspector General of Police Inam Ghani had said, ""Geo-fencing of the entire area was carried out, data was taken from the Election Commission of Pakistan, fingerprints were taken from the site, and DNA tests were conducted"".

IGP Ghani said that after the police went through the records they had gathered they got to know that Abid Ali had four sims registered in his name that he used on several occasions. All of the sims, however, were currently non-functional.

""Ultimately, we tracked down another number — that was not registered to his name — and it proved our suspicions right. Through this number, we were able to reach his partner as well,"" he said.

The Punjab police chief added: ""We are 95% sure that [the person we have tracked down] is his partner as his phone signals were traced to the location of the crime [at the time of the incident].""

The incident

On Wednesday night, it was reported that two robbers had allegedly gang-raped a mother of two on the Lahore-Sialkot motorway in an area falling within Gujjarpura police's jurisdiction.

The woman, along with her two children, was driving to Gujranwala when she was forced to stop at the Gujjarpura section of the motorway after running out of fuel, at around 1:30am.

She immediately called a relative and sent him her location. He asked her to also dial the Motorway Police helpline 130 from which she reportedly received no response.

In the meantime, two robbers reportedly approached the car, broke the window, and took the woman and her children to nearby bushes where they allegedly raped her in front of the children.

They also allegedly snatched her purse carrying Rs100,000 in cash, one bracelet, car registration papers, and three ATM cards.",[],"LAHORE: One of the two suspects in the motorway gang rape case on Sunday surrendered before the police, denying involvement in a highway incident that has angered the entire nation and sparked protests across Pakistan.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/661345-four-accused-held-in-waziristan-honour-killing-case,,Four accused held in Waziristan honour killing case,"MIRANSHAH: The police on Tuesday claimed to have arrested four accused in connection with the recent murder of two teenage girls in the name of honour in North Waziristan.

Speaking at a press conference, District Police Officer Shafiullah Khan Gandapur said that raids were being conducted to arrest the main accused identified as Mahmood Aslam who is stated to be paternal cousin of the girls. The two girls aged 16 and 18 were shot dead in Garyum in North Waziristan on May 14.

He said that the family of the slain girls, who were sisters, and the local people did not want the police to investigate the crime. However, he added that the police had registered the case at the Razmak Police Station on behalf of the state and an investigation team had been formed to probe the matter.

It is stated to be the first incident of its kind in North Waziristan, a former tribal agency that became a district when erstwhile Fata was merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

The short, 52-second video was made on mobile phone. The two teenaged girls and the man, who recorded the video outdoors, are seen in the footage along with a third woman, who was stated to be the wife of the killer and had been spared.

The DPO said that the family of the girls originally belonged to South Waziristan and had shifted to North Waziristan when the military operation was carried out in their areas. The bodies of the girls were secretly shifted to their native Shaktoi area in South Waziristan for burial.

He said that the father of the two girls was also among the four arrested persons. He added that one of the accused, Umar Ayaz, who allegedly leaked the video, belonged to Torikhel in North Waziristan. The DPO said that the video showing the two girls had been made a year ago and had been recently leaked to social media.

Shafiullah Khan said that the police had formed an investigation team on the instructions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General of Police Sanaullah Abbasi. He vowed that all the accused would soon be brought to justice.

He urged the local people to seek help from the police without any fear or hesitation and the cops would extend all-out support to them keeping in view the local customs and traditions. He added that it was the upmost responsibility of the police to protect the life and property of the local people.",['Our Correspondent'],"MIRANSHAH: The police on Tuesday claimed to have arrested four accused in connection with the recent murder of two teenage girls in the name of honour in North Waziristan.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/674504-what-hampered-implementation-of-police-order-2002,,What hampered implementation of Police Order 2002,"Islamabad : For the first time in the history of Pakistan a serious effort was made back in 2001 to get rid of the colonial Police Act introduced by the British back in 1861, which was basically to suppress the local people and enslave them.

The same 1861 Police Act was adopted by Pakistan after independence in 1947. So, effectively, despite getting independence after a long political and legal struggle, people of Pakistan were still being controlled through the cruel Colonial Police Act 1861.

In 2001 a serious effort was initiated to change the situation and bring about a more conducive and effective policing system for which a four-member think tank, headed by former Inspector-General of Police Afzal Ali Shigri, along with former Inspector-General Dr Shuaib Suddle, former Inspector-General (Punjab) Qazi Zulfiqar and a London-based expert, Z.U. Khan was established under National Reconstruction Bureau (NRB), which started deliberations and finalized the Police Order 2002.

The idea was to establish ‘Police Commissionerate’ with greater administrative powers to impose the law in an effective manner. Basically, it was to be more independent in its operations and work beyond the cover of the ‘Pakistan Administrative Service’ or the ‘District Management Group’ comprising assistant commissioners, the deputy commissioners and the commissioners.

The government of the time tried to implement this ‘Police Order 2002’, but for one reason or the other it could never be implemented in full. The question still remain unanswered as to which were the circumstances, or who were the prime and powerful hurdles in the implementation of Police Order 2002 for the last 18 year, even during the military regime as well as during the civil democracy?

Afzal Ali Shigri, a respectable name in the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) and author of the Police Order 2002, when questioned by this correspondent, said, mainly politicians were not in favour of implementing the Police Reforms.

“Not only politicians and Pakistan Administration Service (PAS) group showed resentment against the Police Order 2002, but some top police officers were also against the police reforms,” former IGP Afzal Ali Shigri said, adding that one of the IGP Punjab openly expressed his bitterness against the Police Order before the High Court.

It was mentioned in the ‘Police Order 2002’ that Police, being the lead agency in maintenance of internal security is yet to be reformed, despite transient of four regimes – Musharraf, PPP, PML-N and now PTI – but the previous governments have botched implementing Police Order 2002 in Islamabad Capital Territory.

There has always been conflict between police and Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) which used to gobble-up energy and resources of both the institutions.

It was believed that the PAS remained the main resistance in the implementation of the ‘Police Order 2002’, the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) officers orate, the PAS officers occupy prime positions in the government set up to govern the system.

Under the PAS administrative system, the initiatives of police officers were controlled and institutional growth of police was hindered. The system was also abusive of age old principle of responsibility with authority as a deputy commissioner enjoys supervision over the police force but when something goes wrong, only the police officers would bear the brunt.

Almost 18 years have lapsed but the ‘Police Order 2002’ has yet to come of age in Islamabad and is still awaiting its proper implementation by the provinces and the federal government. The piece of law was promulgated in order to repeal the draconian Police Act of 1861. However, as mentioned in the Crisis Group report, police reforms were sacrificed for political expediency.

Unfortunately, Pakistan lagged behind because of resistance from vested interest groups to preserve their colonial powers.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/600300-women-rights-issue-echoes-in-senate,,Women rights issue echoes in Senate,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate Friday stood totally divided on how much rights should be ensured to women in Pakistan but shared consensus on how they lagged behind as compared to men, as senators discussed the National Commission on Status of Women report.

Those took part in the discussion on the annual report of the commission of the year 2017, which was laid in the Senate by Minister for Human Rights Dr Shireen Mazari on January 22 last year, included Senators Mohsin Aziz, Mushtaq Ahmad, Walid Iqbal, Nuzhat Sadiq and Sherry Rehman.

The widely-discussed issue of a Faisal Vawda, showing a long shoe, also echoed in the House after the question Hour, when PML-N Senator Kulsoom Parveen raised the matter, wondering should the lawmakers stop appearing in TV talk shows, the way a sitting member of this House was ‘insulted’.

She clarified that they had voted not for the boots but for the country’s key security institution, which was so dear to them. “Is this punishment of stopping the minister for a few days from appearing in talks shows is enough,” she asked.

Senators Mohsin Aziz and Mushtaq emphasised during the discussion on the commission report that the women rights should not be seen through the Western lenses and cultural invasion. They insisted that awareness about women rights could not be promoted and drives pushed for their rights while sitting in five-star hotels; instead such events be held in rural areas to read and asses the ground realities.

They said events in the name of culture in academic schools could not be allowed, which ran contrary to social and cultural values, enshrined in the shariah.

They supported women emancipation and lifting their status in the society, freeing them from the clutches of exploitation but not at the cost of values and honour. They also objected to certain slogans raised and inscribed on posters during drives for women rights last year.

Senator Walid Iqbal wondered how the goal of progress and prosperity could be achieved by leaving behind women, which are 50 percent of Pakistan’s population.

Citing a global survey, he said Pakistan was 151st out of 153 countries in terms of gender equality just ahead of Iraq and Yemen.

Senator Sherry Rehman while responding, particularly to Senator Mohsin Aziz’s speech, where she said he cited culture as a reason for oppressing women she said, ""When it comes to women’s rights I expect all parties to adopt a bipartisan approach in Parliament. You cannot justify honour crimes or any other oppression, let alone condemn entire rights movements, in the name of culture. I would urge everyone not to play the religion and culture card because our religion guaranteed women better rights, which should have grown with the demands of social change”.

“It is our fault that we have not given freedom, equality and power that we should have given to women by now. It is the state’s responsibility to nurture those values and carry those rights into the modern world. We [women] are neither a second gender nor will we condone honour crimes in this House.

“Women’s rights are violated regularly in our society but for a progressive party like the PPP, they form a major component of our manifesto and value system. I can proudly say that most of the progressive legislation in the country today has been brought by the PPP or other women legislators and among the provinces by Sindh,” she said.

She thanked those who played a pivotal part in women’s rights movements over the decades and said, “Those women spearheaded the women’s movement with an unprecedented bravery, offering invaluable sacrifices as they faced a dictator like Ziaul Haq. The PPP’s name was attached to this movement as well, as it too was led from the front by a woman and Pakistan’s twice-elected Prime Minister Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto”.

“The civil society at the time, of which I was a member, was facing police lock-ups and stern resistance. But we were not doing it for our own rights. We don’t fight for ourselves. We fight for those who are without privilege or power as honour crimes are mostly faced for those living in deeply vulnerable situations, in rural or tribal areas or situations where they don’t know their rights or are unable to exercise them, with no access to lawyers or justice,"" she noted.

On a lighter note, she said, ""The new women’s movement too must be supported and if Senator Mohsin did not like slogans like heat up your own dinner from the last women’s demonstrations, he should be careful as we will make sure he has to heat up his own dinner too”. The House will now resume Monday afternoon.",['Our Correspondent'],"Senators Mohsin Aziz and Mushtaq emphasised during the discussion on the commission report that the women rights should not be seen through the Western lenses and cultural invasion.

She thanked those who played a pivotal part in women’s rights movements over the decades and said, “Those women spearheaded the women’s movement with an unprecedented bravery, offering invaluable sacrifices as they faced a dictator like Ziaul Haq.","['movement', 'values', 'mohsin', 'senate', 'echoes', 'society', 'culture', 'womens', 'senator', 'issue', 'rights', 'women', 'honour']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/700X390_thenews.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-11/ss_756866_073204_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-11/ss_756867_073745_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'Women rights issue echoes in Senate | Pakistan | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'ISLAMABAD: The Senate Friday stood totally divided on how much rights should be ensured to women in Pakistan but shared consensus on how they lagged behind as compared to men, as senators discussed...', 'keywords': 'women,rights,issue,echoes,senate', 'fb': {'app_id': 650123461797330}, 'og': {'title': 'Women rights issue echoes in Senate', 'image': {'identifier': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'secure_url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'width': 390}, 'description': 'ISLAMABAD: The Senate Friday stood totally divided on how much rights should be ensured to women in Pakistan but shared consensus on how they lagged behind as compared to men, as senators discussed...', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/600300-women-rights-issue-echoes-in-senate', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@thenews_intl', 'creator': '@OCOur Correspondent', 'title': 'Women rights issue echoes in Senate', 'description': 'ISLAMABAD: The Senate Friday stood totally divided on how much rights should be ensured to women in Pakistan but shared consensus on how they lagged behind as compared to men, as senators discussed...', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg?t=015252'}, 'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style': 'black-translucent', 'apple-mobile-web-app-title': 'The News International', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#333333', 'theme-color': '#000000'})",[],news
https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/561400-killed,,What killed her?,"For many, it is the question of who killed her. I believe the question is what killed her? For many, she deserved the fate of being murdered. For others, she did not. It is in these two competing worldviews that the question of what killed Qandeel Baloch lies. Qandeel’s wilful murder is just a high profile case of otherwise occasional happenings of killing in the name of so-called honour across Pakistan.

For her brother, it was for the sake of Baloch honour that he murdered Qandeel. Nevertheless, killing in the name of restoring honour goes far beyond the confines of ethnicity and is equally shared by other ethnic groups from all across Pakistan. In fact, there is no monolithic culture, characteristic of a particular ethnicity. Every ethnicity has a culture, which has crosscurrents to its mainstream. Thus, if a particular person acts in the name of a particular ethnicity, it should not suggest that all members of a given ethnic group will act in a similar fashion.

Culture is not static. Some cultures are more dynamic than others, however. A culture is not uniform either. We have diverse sub-cultures within an overarching dominant culture. In the context of present article, dominant culture is the one which majority of people ascribe to. This culture justifies the killing of Qandeel in the name of honour. Within the same culture, a myriad set of sub-variant cultures either acquiesces to honour killing or at least condones it. For the majority, which subscribes to the overarching culture, Qandeel’s ‘provocative’ videos warranted her murder.

Unfortunately, in a deadly conservative society like ours, you normally do not have the privilege to decide your own choice. You have to give in to the overarching culture more often than not!

If we put the vast majority of subscribers to the dominant culture into the shoes of Qandeel’s brother, they will probably act in a strikingly similar fashion the way Qandeel’s murderer did. Here is the rub: the society we live in is the main hurdle to our individualistic self. An individual is seen through the prism of his or her family, clan and tribe and ethnicity. Especially a female is considered to be the honour of a family. When her reputation is at stake, the honour of whole family is at risk. The surrounding society taunts the families when a girl elopes with a boy or something else of the sort happens. People use profane language, engage in slander and as a result, it becomes too unbearable for the families to withstand the shame.

When violators of the so-called established norms are caught, they are killed. Only then honour is considered to be restored honourably. No different was Qandeel’s case. Her actions were an affront to family’s honour, at least her brother believed so.

What is noteworthy to mention is that every adherent of the dominant culture does not believe in killing in the name of honour. In Pakistan, from February 2014 to February 2016, a total of 1276 people were killed in the name of honour killing.

In opposition to the ascendant culture is its peripheral counterpart, which challenges Qandeel’s so-called honour killing. From this perspective, we might have disagreed with what Qandeel used to do or what she stood for. That was our choice. Did her disagreement with our choice warrant her murder? Of course not for the subscribers of the nonconformist rival culture who believe that each one of us lives a life of his/her own. They have typical laissez-faire attitude towards fellow human beings and believe that no one should dictate others. Identifying where the militant overarching culture takes its roots is important, in order to effect a positive change in the culture.

Religion is a very important ingredient of culture. In our case, it appears to be the most important component on various occasions. Honour killing is not an exception. Nevertheless, it is not Islam per se that enshrines honour killing but men’s interpretation, deeply rooted in patriarchy, of the religion that either espouses killing in the name of honour or at least condones it. Seen this way, the cultural rules are unambiguously made by men.

In fact, Islam has varied cultural streams. No single, uniform interpretation of Islam informs the Muslim world. The religion is congenial to reinterpretation through Ijtihad, which implies solutions to ever-coming human problems within the light of the Holy Quran and Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH). The fact that Islam allows for reinterpretation of religion makes it conducive to accepting modernity. However, the problem is that the dominant clergy of Sunni-Deobandi persuasion is averse to ijtihad. Secondly, no two clergymen are open to each other’s interpretation. What are our options then?

There is an ever-increasing need to slowly and gradually separate politics from religion with state having absolute monopoly on the legitimate use of coercive means. In this context, state as a complainant in Qandeel Baloch’s murder case is a welcome step. This has barred the Baloch family to pardon her killer. The same should be the state attitude in every wilful murder case.",[],"For many, it is the question of who killed her.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/258455-research-launched-for-better-response-to-gender-based-violence-services,,Research launched for better response to gender-based violence services,"PESHAWAR: A fact-finding research to strengthen implementation of pro-women laws and gender-based violence response services in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was launched here on Tuesday.

The aim of the consolation was to share the findings of the research focusing on identification of the gaps in existing response to gender-based violence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Qamar Naseem, programme coordinator, Blue Veins, told the participants the research was conducted to identify the perceptions and positions of the stakeholders working against gender-based violence and gaps among service providers to GBV survivors in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The research vitally contributed in identifying key actors providing services for GBV victims/survivors and identified key existing entry points for GBV response.

It examined the gaps in the coordination among main service providers along examining existing policies and procedures that regulate the GBV response at all levels.

Rukhshanda Naz, a known women rights activist, presented the findings of the research. She mentioned that ""the research strongly reflected that that GBV victims/survivors seeking assistance from the government and non-government service providers encountered economic, social, cultural and organisational barriers.""

""Women and gender minorities face cultural standards that discourage the disclosure of the GBV outside of family circle.

Sometimes the victims/survivors face deliberate negative attitude even from service providers while seeking assistance and protection from gender-based abuse. The GBV victims/survivors in most cases have no guidance resources, freedom to travel, time necessary for visiting several service providers and navigating bureaucratic system to find assistance and protection from abusive behavior,"" she said while reading from the study.

Additional Secretary Law KP government Shakeel Asghar said: ""All survivors despite their sex and gender identity must be entitled to access care without any prejudice and bias. They must be treated with dignity and respect and free from intimidation and blame. It is not only the responsibility of the government but all stakeholders must also play their role to make it happen, he added.

Tariq Iqbal, Director, Police School of Training and Investigation, said, ""The response system available in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for the GBV victims/survivors has fragmented structure of available services. As a result the GBV survivors do not have equal access to services, exposure to re-traumatization and even to fear for personal safety. Therefore, all government and non-government GBV response programs must take into account the needs and cultural challenges in reintegration of GBV survivors.""

The official said all the responses must be designed to achieve meaningful change in the GBV survivors' health, safety, education, economic wellbeing and ability to influence the decisions that affect their lives, he added.

Akhtar Amin, a journalist who regularly covers the GBV, said, ""Survivors of gender-based violence have little hopes with the justice system and they fear immediate and long-term threats to their physical and mental health and social well-being.

""They believe these risks will increase if they do not receive competent, confidential and compassionate care, which is critical to reducing the risk of ongoing injury and suffering,"" he added.

Mohammad Shoaib, Deputy Director Social Welfare Department, said, ""The GBV response mechanism must ensure that these policies are implemented. This policy should be directed to policy makers and legislators, but should also emphasis on the role of community leaders and opinion makers.""

Yahya Ahmad, a member of the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR), said: ""The advocacy roadmap to improve the GBV response in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa must aim at creating or changing policies, laws, regulations, distribution of resources or other decisions that affects the lives and decisions of the GBV victims/survivors"".",[],"PESHAWAR: A fact-finding research to strengthen implementation of pro-women laws and gender-based violence response services in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was launched here on Tuesday.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/721994-police-response-to-motorway-rape-senate-panel-slams-lahore-ccpo-for-conflicting-remarks,,Police response to motorway rape: Senate panel slams Lahore CCPO for conflicting remarks,"LAHORE: The city’s top cop has once again landed himself in hot waters during a hearing of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights to talk about the motorway rape case, on Monday, Geo News reported

Lahore’s Capital City Police Officer (CCPO), Mohammad Umar Sheikh, spoke about the authorities’ response time to a distress call made by a woman when her car broke down on the M-11 Motorway on September 9, saying at one point that it was approximately 28 minutes whereas the officers who reached the site had said they did so under six minutes.

The hearing was held to discuss a gang-rape incident earlier this month when two armed men raped a woman in front of her children when she was stranded on the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway. The horrific case has led to country-wide protests and calls for reforms in laws pertaining to the perpetrators of sexual assault. In the hearing, CCPO Sheikh also said the motorway rape survivor was travelling without her husband's permission.

To which, PPP Senator Krishna Kumari Kohli — a member of the Senate committee — reprimanded him over his comment, telling him not to make any such assumptions in the future. ""Did this lady tell you?"" she asked. ""Do not make assumptions like that,"" Kishoo Bai told him when he said he had made a ""guess"". Not only that but Lahore's top cop also forgot the name of Abid Malhi, the prime suspect who has been in the wind for 20 days and whom the eight special teams — comprising personnel from all of the Punjab Police's departments — have failed to apprehend despite spotting him at least thrice across the province.

Addressing the committee members, Sheikh said: ""If [police helpline] 15 had received the call, we could have reached that place in 25 minutes. The first call to 15 was at 2:47am made by a passerby and the 15 officials reached at 3:15am."" To which, Marri said either the CCPO had no information or the committee had been misinformed.

""The call came at 2:47am and the first [Dolphin Force] officer arrived at 2:53am. I'm telling you the 100% truth,"" the CCPO responded. ""Then your cops are lying,"" Marri shot back at him.

""My job is to stop the crime and catch the culprits,"" Sheikh replied. ""Neither is there a CCTV [camera] at the toll plaza nor is an actual toll tax receipt given.

""Five technologies were used in the motorway rape case; geo-fencing, DNA filing, and fingerprint technology. Even the American police do not respond [to a crime] in six minutes"".

The committee members expressed anger over the contradiction in the police officer's statement. ""You say the police arrived at the scene in 28 minutes but the police said they had reached in six minutes,"" the committee said. ""The police tried to misguide the committee"".

When the CCPO apologised once more, Marri said: ""You don't have to apologise again and again.""

PMAP Senator Usman Kakar, also part of the committee, opined that the policeman should have been punished considering the words he had used. ""The CCPO only apologised out of fear of the court,"" Kakar said.

Sheikh told the committee that Abid's data had successfully been found from the Punjab Forensic Science Agency's (PFSA) 2013 records. ""The first case of Daniel Pearl in Pakistan was solved with [the use of] DNA,"" he said. ""If Abid was involved in 2013, why was he released,"" asked Khokhar.

The cop once again joined his hands in front of the committee in a bid to seek forgiveness. ""Babar Malhi's blood and DNA have also matched,"" he said. At which, the committee members paused, in shock, and asked: ""Babar Malhi or Abid Malhi?""

The cop responded: ""Forgive me my sister, I have joined my hands in front of you, I beg you. I am 56 years old and my memory, too, is according to my age. ""I have sought forgiveness from the committee and apologised. Let me just once stand in front of the joint meeting and I will apologise in front of everyone there.""

Upon further probing, he said: ""What if there is an outrage if I say something? I have told the chief justice who is responsible. I will introduce court-martial law in the Punjab Police.

""There are 500 people and something or the other gets leaked,"" he said of his police force. ""If it was in my power, I wouldn't spare anyone. This is what will happen to anyone who wishes to bring reforms,"" he added, referring to himself.

Speaking further on the incident, he said the inquiry number was of the motorway but the rescue vehicles come under the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO). ""In this case, too, an FWO officer was taken on the woman's conference call. He told her he would send a car. ""That car was on the M2 [motorway] and it took a long time to reach the site,"" Sheikh said. ""The crux of the matter is that this alert should have been to 15.""",['News Report'],"In the hearing, CCPO Sheikh also said the motorway rape survivor was travelling without her husband's permission.

SARGODHA: Police arrested a 22-year-old man for allegedly shooting his sister for 'honour' after she married for the sixth time.

Police had launched an investigation into the alleged murder of 30-year-old Nighat Parveen after her sixth husband, Waseem Amjad, filed a complaint on August 17 with police that his wife had been kidnapped.

Employing technological methods in the investigation, police were able to trace the last call made from Parveen’s mobile phone to her parents' house. When police grilled the victim's parents, they were told that she had gone to Islamabad with her friends.

Later, police started questioning Parveen’s 22-year-old brother Abdullah Hashim who allegedly confessed to murdering his sister during the investigation.

Abdullah allegedly told police that his sister had become “a source of disgrace” for his family for the past eight years. He added that people in the village had also started questioning the family's honour due to Parveen's ""character"".

Police say Hashim confessed that when Parveen returned to her parents' home after tying the knot for the sixth time, he shut her inside a room and shot her to death.

According to police, the victim's brother has been arrested and the weapon used to commit the crime has also been recovered. Police added that a case will be registered against the suspect and he will be presented in court soon.",[],"Police say victim's 22-year-old brother Abdullah Hashim allegedly confessed to murdering his sister during probe.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/554646-slaves-inaction,,Slaves to inaction,"While other countries in the region with limited resource base are focusing on the development of their people, Pakistan continues to fumble on the fronts of development and human rights, which are necessary for economic development, democratisation and rule of law. One example of Pakistan’s fumbling is prevalence of what is termed modern slavery. Pakistan has been ranked number three in the world with high level of forced and child labour and human trafficking.

According to the Global Slavery Index report 2013 published by the Walk Free Organization of Australia, out of 29.8 million people in the world more than two million people are engaged in modern slavery-like conditions in Pakistan which include debt bondage, forced marriage, and sale or exploitation of children, human trafficking and forced labour.

The reasons cited by the report for existence of, what it terms, modern slavery in the world include weak economy, rising poverty, illiteracy, deteriorating security situation and rule of law and a growing population. All these factors make the poor vulnerable to different forms of servitude.

It further says that modern slavery is found in sectors like primary industries, manufacturing, commercial sexual exploitation, forced begging and domestic servitude. Two provinces -- Sindh and Punjab -- have the highest prevalence of bonded labour in agriculture and brick kiln industry.

The government must ensure implementation of national laws which render modern slavery a crime. Besides addressing the problems of poverty, illiteracy and underemployment, the government should also ratify all the conventions/protocols of the United Nations on trafficking.

Macro-economic policies, low level of social protection allocation and insufficient development budgets continue to haunt the country. One of the major reasons is informalisation of economy which has systematically continued over the past several years which has left deep imprints on the overall development and shaped the structure of society that continues to grow dangerous. More than 70 per cent labour force is associated with informal sector in Pakistan and of around 57 million labour force, a very small number of labour (nearly five per cent) is organised.

State of Pakistan has shown indifference to these very grave problems of modern times. For example, the state is responsible, under the Constitution of Pakistan, for extending social protection to the citizens. However, only 0.2 per cent of the GDP is allocated to social protection spending.

The country is also performing poorly on the human development front. The UNDP also released its 2013 Human Development Index (HDI) along with the report, which ranks countries in terms of economic and human development indicators. The Multidimensional Poverty Index, an alternative to income-based poverty estimates, shows the proportion of the population living in poverty is high throughout South Asia. In Pakistan, multidimensional poverty is 49 per cent.

The results revealed in the National Nutrition Survey of Pakistan 2011 also substantiate these reports and indicate a worrisome scenario. At national level, about 42 per cent of the households are food secure while the remaining 58 per cent are food insecure.

Literacy level in Pakistan continues to remain a serious concern despite the commitments Pakistan has made to increase it. According to the United Nations Development Programme, ""Pakistan’s literacy rate, though having improved marginally over the years, remains considerably short of the MDG target of 88 per cent by 2015 at 58 per cent, and closer inspection reveals large gender and rural/urban disparities."" Progress on MDG 4, in all but one target, is also off-track. In such conditions, people have to compromise with exploitative conditions to earn their bread and butter.

Pakistan is signatory to many international conventions on modern slavery including Slavery Convention, Supplementary Slavery Convention, Forced Labour Convention, Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, CRC Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, but hasn’t ratified UN Trafficking Protocol.

Another major challenge is that the budget allocated by the government to respond to modern slavery is not known. The responsibility of labour inspections rests with provincial governments since devolution of power. Also, the mandate of labour inspectorates differs from province to province under different procedures.

Green Rural Development Organization (GRDO) Executive Director, Dr Ghulam Hyder, says that these problems have emanated from the unequal and unjust distribution of resources. ""Pakistan’s ruling elite and landed aristocracy have got hold over resources while the majority weaker sections of society have no or very little resources."" He laments the lack of interest by successive governments in implementing the laws and international conventions.

Implementation of Bonded Labour System Abolition Act 1992 and its corresponding Rules 1995 is an example. So far, not a single case has been registered under this act. After the 18th Amendment, these rules fall under the domain of provinces. Punjab has enacted some laws on bonded labour.

The report also mentions domestic violence against women, forced marriages and traditions of Vani as other problems that plague the society. Though the Prevention of Anti-Women Practices Bill was passed in 2011, its enforcement is yet another stumbling block.

The government must ensure implementation of national laws which render modern slavery a crime. Besides addressing the problems of poverty, illiteracy and underemployment, the government should also ratify all the conventions/protocols of the United Nations on trafficking.",[],"One example of Pakistan’s fumbling is prevalence of what is termed modern slavery.
The government must ensure implementation of national laws which render modern slavery a crime.
The UNDP also released its 2013 Human Development Index (HDI) along with the report, which ranks countries in terms of economic and human development indicators.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/713116-three-suspected-criminals-shot-dead-in-encounters-with-police,,Three suspected criminals shot dead in encounters with police,"Three different encounters between police and alleged criminals left three suspects dead and a suspect and a policeman wounded on Thursday. A citizen was also allegedly injured by a robber.

The Sachal police said that two criminals were killed during an encounter with law enforcers near Sher Goth on the Super Highway. They said a citizen was also wounded by the firing of those robbers, adding that the deceased and the injured were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre.

SHO Haroon Korai said the robbers were trying to escape after injuring the citizen, namely Shah Muhammad, over offering resistance to a mugging bid, when a crowd of people gathered on the spot and surrounded the suspects.

The officer said the police also arrived on the scene after a local informed them on the 15 helpline, adding that the robbers opened fire on the police and tried to escape. Korai said the law enforcers shot back and during an exchange of fire both the robbers were gunned down, adding that the suspects were identified as Amir and Subhan, who hailed from the Sadiqabad area of Faisalabad.

The officer said the police also impounded a motorbike and seized weapons and a mobile phone, the latter of which, he added, the suspects had snatched from the injured citizen.

Another shoot-out

The New Karachi Industrial Area police said that a suspect was killed and a policeman wounded during a shoot-out, adding that the deceased and the injured were taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital.

Police said law enforcers were on routine patrol when they tried to intercept two suspects on a motorbike, adding that the suspects tried to escape by opening fire on the police, injuring 25-year-old Israr Gulzar. Officials said the police shot back and killed one of the suspects, adding that the law enforcers seized weapons found from the person of the deceased.

‘Fake case’

Sohrab Goth police said that two suspects, including an injured one, were arrested after an exchange of fire. They identified the injured as Humayun Murtaza and his accomplice as Shoaib. Officials also claimed to have seized weapons from them.

Following the incident, however, a group of men calling themselves Murtaza’s friends arrived at the Sohrab Goth police station, where they shot a video and circulated it on social media. In the video clip they claimed that their group of six friends had stopped at a paan shop on their way home in the wee hours after having dinner at a restaurant on the Super Highway.

They said that after getting paan, Murtaza was speeding away on his motorbike when the police intercepted him near the Dua Hotel, adding that before the man could stop his two-wheeler, the law enforcers followed him and opened fire on him. The alleged friends said Murtaza suffered a bullet injury and the police then arrested him and Shoaib, adding that the law enforcers later claimed that they had arrested criminals. They claimed in the video that they had a receipt from the restaurant where they had their dinner, and that the police were trying to implicate the arrested men in a fake case.",['Our Correspondent'],"Three different encounters between police and alleged criminals left three suspects dead and a suspect and a policeman wounded on Thursday.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/740798-uae-relaxes-laws-on-alcohol-cohabitation,,"UAE relaxes laws on alcohol, cohabitation","ABY DHABI: The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has moved to revise its personal laws, loosening restrictions on alcohol and cohabitation of unmarried couples as well as scrapping lenient penalties for “honor killings,” the state media said. The changes, which were announced on Saturday by the government-run WAM news agency, are intended to “consolidate the UAE’s principles of tolerance” and improve the Gulf nation’s economic and social profile. However, the agency didn’t specify when the new relaxed rules will go into force.

Penalties for alcohol consumption, possession and sales for those 21 and over will be eliminated in the Muslim country, which positions itself as a more Westernized tourist hotspot than other areas in the region. UAE citizens previously required a special license to drink beer and other liquors at bars or at home.

The reform will also allow “cohabitation of unmarried couples.” Such behavior has been considered criminal in UAE for a long time.

The legal clause which allowed the judges to issue merciful sentences to men who commit a so-called “honor killing” has also been removed. Those crimes will from now be treated as a regular murder.

The reform comes amid the US-brokered normalisation of ties between longtime regional foes UAE and Israel, which is expected to bring investment and numerous Israeli tourists to the Gulf country.

Dubai is also hosting the World Expo in 2021-22. It’s planned that some 25 million people will visit the country for the major international event, greatly boosting economic activity in the UAE.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/385497-after-kasur-another-child-abuse-scandal-emerges,,"Exclusive: After Kasur, another child abuse scandal emerges","ISLAMABAD: On September 1, Mubarak Ali returned to his village to spend weekend with the family.

His son, a 9th class student, was sitting silent in a corner with a dejected face. On seeing his father, he broke into tears.“I have experienced the worst of my life,” the son said and started crying. He was molested by a local influential the same day and his abuse was filmed. This was the second time in three days that his son had gone through the ordeal. The cost of speaking up was fraught with danger, as the accused was son of a local influential and a serial abuser with more than dozen victims in two villages alone: Chak 6/1L and Chak 18/1L situated near Renala Khurd, tehsil headquarters of Okara district.

Challenging the accused was a gigantic task for Mubarak. He is a driver in a Manga Mandi factory near Lahore. Providing good education to his children so that they have a life better than him remains his only dream. He was outraged at this despicable incident. More so, because this was not the first incident. The pattern is reminiscent of Kasur child abuse scandal that had shaken the nation. Incidentally, the ring leaders at Kasur and Okara not only share the caste, their families have migrated from the same place in India (Ferozepur). Unconfirmed reports also suggest linkage between both the gangs.

In majority of the cases, the parents of victims have been submitted into silence. Others who decided to proceed against the accused were failed by the system or circumstances. Another child was molested by the same accused and his video was made viral. Only then, his parents came to know. The video haunted him wherever he would go. Friends and foes would point the finger at him. A complaint registered with the FIA’s Cybercrime Wing went unnoticed. The situation culminated at his quitting the school. He was studying in 10th class in the same school his father teaches. For months to come, he remained confined to home. His passion for sports died as he couldn’t face people. His parents consoled him but in vain. It took him a year to recover a bit. Now, he sits at the shop that his elder brother runs but no more studies or sports.

His father told The News about his plan of shifting to a nearby city to pull his child out of trauma. Right now, he is trying to sell his house. The playgrounds and school canteens are the favorite hunting spot of the accused, Asadullah, who is an employee of Wapda where he is a meter reader. His father is the chairman of union council thus well-connected with MPAs and MNAs of the area. The elder brother of the accused, a policeman, also faces sodomy allegations. A few years ago, he molested a student. His family’s efforts to seek police help didn’t yield result. He was the son of a mason. The victim had to quit studies; his family shifted him to relatives before he was sent to the UAE for labor. In majority of cases, the matter was hushed up by exerting pressure on the families of victims facing stigma and trauma alike. Others who decided to take the legal course were checkmated as medical examination of the victims were manipulated through influencing the hospital administration. That victims informed parents days after the incident when it was too late to undergo medical checkup turned out yet another reason for not pursuing the matter.

In the case of Mubarak’s son, the incident had occurred the day he came to know. He approached the Renala Khurd Police for registering the FIR. They were reluctant in the beginning. Mubarak threatened that he would set himself on fire before the police station if the complaint was not registered. A lawyer also pressured the police and finally the FIR was registered and the accused was arrested. The medical report also testified molestation. As the matter went to the local court, the accused party engaged an influential lawyer. The proceedings started and Mubarak had to appear almost every second day. He would travel from his workplace (Manga Mandi) to Renala Khurd to ensure his presence. Meanwhile, the evidence was sent to the forensic laboratory in Lahore.

Mubarak has only guarded optimism in the system but he is determined to fight. In addition to pursuing courts and police, he has to ward off local pressure demanding withdrawal of the case. In return, he is being offered financial compensation which he refused to accept. “I will fight till death,” he resolved. Somebody will have to stand up to save the children,” he said. Asked how his victim son is, he said: “He remains silent as if a lost soul; sometimes starts crying. He doesn’t go to playground anymore.”",['Umar Cheema'],"On seeing his father, he broke into tears.“I have experienced the worst of my life,” the son said and started crying.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/703584-dr-maha-laid-to-rest-as-police-yet-to-solve-mystery-behind-her-death,,Dr Maha laid to rest as police yet to solve mystery behind her death,"The investigators probing the death of doctor Syeda Maha, whose body was found in a washroom of her house, remains clueless given the mystery behind the apparent suicide case in Karachi’s posh locality is yet to be resolved.

The post-mortem report has found that a bullet was fired at her from a close range and police have written a letter to the authorities concerned for verification of the pistol used in the incident on Thursday.

Police say the investigations are at a preliminary level. “Nothing could be said exactly. It is yet to be ascertained if it was a murder or a suicide,” says Gizri SHO Pervez Methani. According to the investigators, the post-mortem report found that a bullet was fired from a close range. The officer said a Brazil-made 9mm pistol was used and police had sent the bullet and the spent casing for forensic examination and ballistics cross-matching.

Police have also approached the South deputy commissioner for the verification of the pistol. Police said a case would be registered if it was confirmed that the woman was murdered.

Though the deceased’s family has refused to initiate any legal proceedings into the matter, police on Thursday went to the victim’s hometown Mirpurkhas, where the deceased was laid to rest, to record the statements of the family members and relatives. The victim was the daughter of the custodian of a saint’s shrine famous as Girhori Sharif in Mirpurkhas.

SHO Methani said police had examined the cell phone records of the deceased and were questioning her friends. “The main challenge for us is to find out from where the deceased got a weapon,” says the officer.

Late Tuesday night, Syeda Maha was found dead in the Defence Housing Authority after reportedly developing differences with her father. The family in their initial statement had told police Maha locked herself in the washroom and committed suicide by shooting. She was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre with critical injury to head. Doctors said her brain cells were damaged in the incident as the bullet pierced through her head.

According to police, the victim was unmarried and recently rented a house in the Defence area. She hailed from Mirpurkhas and was living with her parents and younger siblings – two sisters and a brother. She was said to have had a verbal fight with her father before her death.",['Faraz Khan'],"It is yet to be ascertained if it was a murder or a suicide,” says Gizri SHO Pervez Methani.

Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari was also present here in court in Judicial Complex, Rawalpindi on the occasion. Advocate Jaweria Rehman Faisal the lawyer of victim party has briefed her on the Zohra Shah case. Minister came in court to show solidarity with the parents of victim girl.

After court proceeding, Human Rights Minister during media talk said the problem was not in the law but its implementation in the rampant child abuse cases across the country.

Mazari said the government has already enacted laws on child labour and that kids under the age of 14 cannot be employed for domestic work. She said that according to Employment of Children Act 1991, we have banned employment of domestic and other labours in federal capital, Islamabad. “I wish to implement this act in the whole country,” she said.

""The Zohra Shah torture and murder case is a very important one for us. It's a test case,"" she said.

Noting that her goal was to support and ensure there was justice in the case, she said there punishment should be meted out according to the law.

Mazari added that complaints regarding missing kids and child abuse incidents can be lodged on the Zainab Alert app.

Zohra Shah, an eight-year-old domestic help also known as Zahra Shah in international media reports, was tortured to death in Rawalpindi by her employers back in May 2020 after she accidentally freed two expensive parrots.

A man, identified as Hassan Siddiqui and who worked in buying and selling exotic birds, had hired little Zohra to look after his children. According to police she was cleaning the cage when she inadvertently let the two parrots free.

Hassan and his wife got infuriated and brutally beat the maid,"" a police spokesperson said at the time, adding that Siddiqui confessed that he and his wife thrashed the girl in a fit of anger.

It was Siddiqui who had brought Zohra to the hospital but he vanished from the scene before he could be linked to her. The eight-year-old, however, succumbed to her injuries a day later. Both accused involved in this case are in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi, for over four months.

LAHORE: An accomplice of the main suspect in the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway gang-rape case confessed to the crime on Monday, Geo News reported citing sources.



However, the key suspect Abid Ali remains at large.

The sources added that Shafqat Ali, with whom key suspect Abid used to commit crimes, confessed to gang-raping a woman when her car had broken down on the Lahore-Sialkot motorway on Sept 9 even before his DNA test was carried out.

An official DNA test of Shafqat, a resident of Bahawalnagar who was arrested from Dipalpur, would still be conducted soon, the sources said, adding that the sample taken from him has already matched the one obtained from the rape survivor.

No official conclusive DNA report has been issued yet, the sources clarified.

Minutes after news broke about Shafqat's arrest, Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar confirmed that the man's DNA had matched with the sample obtained from the rape survivor and that he had confessed to the crime.

""Our entire team is constantly trying to arrest the accused Abid Ali, whose arrest is expected soon, God willing,"" Buzdar said on Twitter.

Shafqat is the second suspected rapist apart from Abid Ali, they added, and that Waqarul Hassan Shah and Abbas were not suspects anymore.

They said Waqar claimed that Abid had links to Shafqat and his brother-in-law, Abbas, the latter of whom has been detained. Shafqat was then arrested from Dipalpur after being traced through his phone SIM card.

The DNA samples obtained from Shafqat were sent to the laboratory for testing.

PFSA system identified Abid as 2013 rapist

According to the reports, Shafqat and Abid were at the Lahore-Sialkot motorway on Sept 9 with an intention to rob any motorist when they saw a stationary white-coloured car on the roadside. The two approached the vehicle, threatened and robbed its occupants, and then gang-raped the woman in front of her children after dragging them to a nearby field.

Police explained that apart from Shafqat's statement, his DNA had to match as well, which is why the samples had been sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA). The arrest was made with use of footprint-tracking as well as DNA samples.

The PFSA had Abid's prior DNA records from 2013, when he had raped a woman and her daughter. The lab's system identified him as the same rapist from more than seven years ago.

'Abid also used to use my phone'

Abbas, Waqar's brother-in-law who has been in police custody as well, said in his statement that he had no connection to Abid Ali.

""Abid came to us and asked for employment,"" he said. ""I employed him and our contact was only work-related.""

Like other labourers, ""Abid also used to use my phone"" and ""work with me at the steel factory"", he added, noting that he surrendered himself to police and hoped to get justice.

On the other hand, Abbas' father said his son used to work as a contractor in the steel factory and that Abid worked with him there. ""Abid used my son's phone,"" he explained.

Other detained suspect denies involvement

The Lahore motorway gang-rape case has sent shockwaves throughout the entire country and sparked major protests across Pakistan, with many demanding capital punishment for the perpetrators and a conversation on sexual abuse being taken up in mainstream debates.

On the other hand, the prime suspect, Abid Ali, remained at large, and police teams were conducting raids at different locations to search for and arrest him.

Waqarul Hassan, the other suspect the government of Punjab had identified in the case, had surrendered himself on Sunday at Lahore's Model Town police station. He had claimed that his brother-in-law was using the mobile phone that had wrongly implicated him in the crime, adding that he was not involved.

It was Waqar who told police that the prime suspect, Abid, used to commit crimes along with an individual named Shafqat.

Police had earlier dispatched teams to Bahawalnagar and Sheikhupura to arrest Shafqat. Abid's brother-in-law and other relatives had also been arrested, they had added.

Police shared on Monday that further investigations have suggested that Waqarul Hasan may indeed not have been involved, adding that a final decision on the matter will be taken after they receive the DNA report of the suspect.

Chohan compares motorway case with Zainab's

Punjab Information Minister Fayyaz ul Hasan Chohan, when asked about the delay in the arrest of Abid Ali, compared the case to the 2018 rape and murder of seven-year-old Zainab.

“Even three years ago, when the Zainab rape case happened, it took three months to get hold of the culprits although the province had used all of its powers to get hold of the culprits,” reminded Chohan while speaking to Geo Pakistan.

The minister said Abid Ali had committed rape for the first time in June 2013 and a first information report (FIR) was lodged against him but he was released after some time during Shahbaz Sharif’s government. He also shared that the forensic report had also been finalised months after his release.

He recalled that police have carried out geofencing of the area and have been working day and night with 28 teams on the case. He also shared that the law enforcement agency was able to identify Abid Ali “within 72 hours”.

“Yesterday, Waqarul Hassan surrendered after the police closely tracked him down. The police should be given credit where it is due,” said Chohan.

Talking about laws regarding protection of women and children, the minister said that there were a lot of laws for the safety of women and children ""but they are never implemented”.

“This is my personal opinion, not the government’s stance, but I think the rapists should be punished publicly after fulfilling all legal terms,” said the minister. He added if this does not happen then a speedy investigation and prosecution should be done.

Parents' appeal to authorities

Meanwhile, speaking to Geo News, Waqar's mother said that her son is innocent and that he decided to surrender himself after he got to know of the incident.

""If my son had done something wrong, he wouldn't have surrendered himself,"" she said. The suspect's mother appealed to Chief Minister Usman Buzdar to ensure justice is served in Waqar's case.

""My son is a pious and religious person, his life should be spared,"" she said, adding: ""He runs a motorcycle repairing shop in Qilla Sattar Shah.""

""If my son was a culprit, why would he present himself [to the law enforcement agencies],"" she asked.

The mother said that she has four daughters and two sons and one of her sons was ill.

Meanwhile, Waqar's father said that his son is not a ""thief"" and ""works at a shop"".

He said Waqar is ""innocent"" and appealed to the authorities to release him.

Rs2.5 million reward

On Saturday, Chief Minister Punjab Usman Buzdar had announced a reward of Rs2.5 million for each of the suspects if information leading to their arrest is shared. He said that the identity of those bringing forward any information will be kept confidential.

""We worked day and night and launched a probe using scientific techniques. I personally monitored the progress and directed the completion of the probe expediently,"" Buzdar had said.

According to the chief minister, seven cases — including two gang-rape cases — were registered against Abid, while two robbery cases were filed against Waqar who was reportedly released 14 days earlier on bail.

Buzdar said that the culprits will be given exemplary punishment for the heinous crime.

While briefing the media about how the police identified the suspects, Inspector General of Police Inam Ghani had said, ""Geo-fencing of the entire area was carried out, data was taken from the Election Commission of Pakistan, fingerprints were taken from the site, and DNA tests were conducted"".

IGP Ghani said that after the police went through the records they had gathered they got to know that Abid Ali had four SIMs registered in his name that he used on several occasions. All of the SIMs, however, were currently non-functional.

""Ultimately, we tracked down another number — that was not registered to his name — and it proved our suspicions right. Through this number, we were able to reach his partner as well,"" he said.

The Punjab police chief added: ""We are 95% sure that [the person we have tracked down] is his partner as his phone signals were traced to the location of the crime [at the time of the incident].""

The incident

On Wednesday night, it was reported that two robbers had allegedly gang-raped a mother of two on the Lahore-Sialkot motorway in an area falling within Gujjarpura police's jurisdiction.

The woman, along with her children, was driving to Gujranwala when she was forced to stop at the Gujjarpura section of the motorway after running out of fuel, at around 1:30am.

She immediately called a relative and sent him her location. He asked her to also dial the Motorway Police helpline 130 from which she reportedly received no response.

In the meantime, two robbers reportedly approached the car, broke the window, and took the woman and her children to nearby bushes where they allegedly raped her in front of the children.

They also allegedly snatched her purse carrying Rs100,000 in cash, one bracelet, car registration papers, and three ATM cards.",[],"— YouTubeLAHORE: An accomplice of the main suspect in the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway gang-rape case confessed to the crime on Monday, Geo News reported citing sources.

In today’s time, it has become easier than ever before to spread awareness on any given issue, considering the power of social media and various other mediums. Television is one of them. Recent times have seen a surge of socially relevant plays as well as commercials that aim to educate viewers on a lot of prevalent issues that are contaminating our society. A recent addition in the list is an initiative called ‘Choona Mana Hay’ that promotes raising voice against child abuse.

Actor Adnan Siddiqui recently took to social media and shared about this effort of a group of citizens, called ‘Kasur Hamara Hai’, who have come together to spread the word.

He posted: “Children are the last link to/of humanity. Child abuse is a menace that is unfortunately spreading rapidly and is a global problem that needs to be tackled. My heart shudders as I write this post. Child abuse is not only restricted to homes now but has found its way into the education system as well. It’s also not gender specific. There are small girls and boys who are being subjected to abuse of various kinds like physical, emotional and sexual abuse. The kids of today are the future of tomorrow. Imagine we’re walking towards a future where the children are not safe.”

He shared two TV commercials that have been made by the group. The videos highlight that we often witness situations where a child is being abused but we don’t realize it.

“There’s a pressing need to not only educate the kids regarding abuse but also educate adults. There’s a difference between a good touch and a bad touch – learn to differentiate!” Adnan concluded.",[],"A recent addition in the list is an initiative called ‘Choona Mana Hay’ that promotes raising voice against child abuse.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/567336-gully-boy-celebrated,,Why Gully Boy should be celebrated,"One of the first scenes in Gully Boy is a confusing, but exciting one. Murad (Ranveer Singh), the underdog poet/rapper of the movie, who lives in the slums of Dharavi, is standing by the entrance of his house, watching a man (his father?) walk in with a bride. As the people in the gully make room for the couple to pass, Murad stands fixed on his spot, and plugs in his earphones. The rap song he is listening to grows louder, drowning out the wedding music. We, the audience, slip into his feet, listening to the music with him, zoning out his surroundings. We do not completely understand what is going on -- Is his mother dead? But didn’t we see her two scenes ago? -- but we trust him. We trust that it will make sense; for the moment, we are present with him, moved by the distance he feels.

This is not a usual scene in Bollywood. It lingers without explanation. It does not effectively serve its plot-point, the father’s second marriage, which could have been relayed through quicker dialogue. It is too empathic, too realist, and realism is not a quality one associates with Bollywood.

Growing up on Bollywood, I have known it as the site of impossible truth-bending. A world where natural laws can be defied in the service of a masala script, where the wildest twists can be smoothed out to result in a happy ending. Dead people can come back to life, pills inserted inside paans can impregnate people. Bollywood is founded upon exaggeration and absurdity, on rules that are stripped of their fidelity to the real world. The same applies to its characters, who do not behave naturally, they are superficial at best, if not completely un-human and unreal. Growing up on Bollywood, I have known it as the site of impossible truth-bending. A world where natural laws can be defied in the service of a masala script, where the wildest twists can be smoothed out to result in a happy ending. Dead people can come back to life, pills inserted inside paans can impregnate people. Bollywood is founded upon exaggeration and absurdity, on rules that are stripped of their fidelity to the real world. The same applies to its characters, who do not behave naturally, they are superficial at best, if not completely un-human and unreal.

Watching Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham, for instance, there is the acute awareness that this is Shahrukh playing Rahul or Kareena playing Poo -- we are never really convinced that Rahul and Poo are real people who actually talk like this, because it is difficult to distill the character on-screen from the superstar celebrity playing at them, and because real people do not dramatise and over-explain. In K3G and most of Bollywood, characters are expository and one-dimensional. They voice their ulterior motives, they help make connections in the plot-line, they lack depth, and move only in service of the script. There is zero breathing room where the audience can actually, meaningfully connect with the character on-screen. In short, there is no room for a scene like Murad watching the street, standing by with his earphones.

Which is how Gully Boy raises the bar. It is full of quiet scenes that do not necessarily further the main plot, but allow us to linger in the characters’ lives. Murad and Safeena (Alia Bhatt) romancing in the bus; Safeena being scolded at home; Murad and his friends smoking up on the bench; MC Sher (Siddhant Chaturvedi) with his alcoholic father; Murad writing by himself at night. Zoya Akhtar takes us through the different spaces these characters inhabit, stitching the narrative through banal spaces of routine; she connects us to these characters by letting us experience their everyday moments of intimacy. Important revelations and plot-points are shot with the same matter-of-factness of a day moving ahead: Murad folding the towel before placing it back in his rich friend’s bathroom; Murad having dinner with his family in the new apartment; Safeena crying by herself. Gully Boy’s characters feel real and believable because we witness their lives through their everyday.

As we see these characters in different spaces and settings, we start to think of them as multi-dimensional. We see how different parts of them surface on different occasions, how nobody is attached to a single concern or plot-line. Their decisions and contradictions are convincing because they exist and behave like real people; moving in multiple places, juggling the different parts of their lives, channeling their frustration from one relationship into another, now warm, now inexplicable, now familiar, now unpredictable. We are moved even when they mess up, because just like real human beings, they do not exist on a single pitch. Murad is more than his rap, Safeena more than her relationship, and Moeen (Vijay Varma) more than his drug-dealing.

By humanising its characters in this way, the film also humanises their identities. They are not a caricature of the gender, religion or social class they represent, unlike typical Bollywood movies, where a woman is only concerned with her love life, where the Muslim character is obsessed with Islam, and the poor character only complains about her poverty.

It helps that the characters are not typecast, of course. Murad is not the macho Bollywood hero blindly following the family’s parampara, but a humbler, more tender individual, who uses his gender privilege only where he needs to take a stand. Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti have ushered in a new kind of hero, one who isn’t necessarily un-masculine, but whose masculinity is also grounded in his emotional power. Then there’s Safeena, a complicated, unforgiving heroine who is neither the bad girl, nor the virtuous Parvati. Her moral compass is sketchy and unreliable; she is caring, but also jealous and possessive, even violent. What is key here, is that she does not carry the burden of being the perfect, supportive, submissive girlfriend, nor the burden of representing all of womankind: she is her own person, and therefore, once again, a real person.

The main characters are all Muslim, but at no point is that all they are. It is impossible not to compare Gully Boy against the scores of movies which have always shown Muslim characters glued to the prayer mat, or speaking in a stream of Mashallahs and Inshallahs, or brandishing tasbeehs just in case we forget their Muslimness. Murad goes to the mosque in the same way he goes to rap circles; Safeena takes off her scarf when she like without making a big deal out of it; and not once does the Azaan blare in the background. For Muslims in Gully Boy, Islam is part and parcel of their days but it is not the only thing that defines them.

Similarly, class is present everywhere, but it is not constantly named. It is present visually and experientially, through the slums Murad and his friends live in, through the clothes they wear and the spaces they hang out in, through Murad’s job as a driver, in the toxicity of his family’s circumstances, in the weight of his responsibilities. It is present in his relationship with Sky (Kalki Koechlin), in his gesture of covering his face when a white tourist photographs him, in the nights he tries to record music without interruption. Class is a shadow that falls on Murad throughout the film; and while his life is not just about class, but also love, friendship, dreams, ambition, the film shows the nuances of how class intersects with each of these themes.

For once in Bollywood, class is not demonised, it is not evil or morally corrupt. Most interesting is the character of Moeen, who ‘uses’ young boys to peddle drugs. In a poignant scene, Murad is screaming at Moeen for making the boys do his dirty work, and Moeen replies: At least I give them a roof over their head. Would you rather they be abandoned? This is a moment where the audience checks their class privilege. I know I did: in judging Moeen and limiting him to a single context, I realised I had reduced his identity to the poor, fallen drug-dealer, permitting no room for the caring guardian. I had failed to empathise.

Which is constantly what Gully Boy is asking you to do, especially in terms of class, making the middle/upper class audiences aware of their gaze. The tourist scene, for sure, where they are teeming through Murad’s family’s house with exclamations of ‘How exotic!’ But also the character of Sky: the well-meaning but still-ignorant elite friend who helps Murad make a music video. Sky is a critique of the English speaking, study-abroad brand of social justice activists whose generosity aids their personal gain, and who are often blind to their own problematics. Many of us will be made uncomfortable by the character of Sky because we will see ourselves in her. In the graffiti scene, Sky spray paints radical-sounding slogans like ‘Brown + Beautiful’ but Murad paints ‘Roti Kapra Makan & Internet’ in Hindi. When they are recording the song, Sky tells Murad she is interested in him because she sees beyond his class, sees him as an artist. We don’t buy it. Through Sky, the movie suggests that even with all our good intentions, our idea of what is equalizing (art, maybe?) is grossly misleading. But perhaps we are made most aware of our class gaze in the song ‘Doori’ when Murad/Ranveer looks directly into the camera, breaking the fourth wall, reminding us of our own complicity.

Gully Boy has shown how to humanise the people we would never know, foster connection through banality and vulnerability, make us aware of our gaze, and open up room for empathy.

Despite these undercurrents, Gully Boy has still been critiqued for its class politics. Specifically, how it sells the individualistic, neoliberal dream of ‘making it’, that if you work hard enough, you will get there. While the movie does promote this trajectory, I think it offers a subdued version of the usual rags-to-riches story. It is only in the second half that the Nas concert presents itself as an opportunity, and globalization offers its fruits to Murad, his sweet escape out of poverty. To even get to the point where Murad has the confidence to audition, he is helped by very different powers: social media and community. Murad’s early journey into hip hop and rap is mediated through Facebook, a capitalist agent sure, but also a democratising tool for a poor kid in the slums; and Murad’s rise to prominence is fueled by the unwavering support of the hip hop community, by MC Sher and his tribe. It can be criticised as unrealistic, such unconditional, pure loyalty and support, or it could be seen as a hopeful, positive re-imagination of social norms in a cinematic milieu that thrives upon villains who are waiting to ruin the protagonist’s plans.

Still, not everyone is happy with Gully Boy. Yes, it reinforces the neoliberal myth, the false idea that passion alone can carry you through. It waters down anti-establishment politics, by co-opting the Azadi slogan and editing it to make it more digestible. And it erases the chant’s link to Kashmir or JNU. Meanwhile, Gully Boy’s superstars are certainly not helping matters. Alia Bhatt commented that Safeena’s identity as a Muslim has nothing to do with her character. Zoya Akhtar distanced herself from the Azadi critique, claiming that the erasure was irrelevant because the movie is about economic disparity. It would have been better for her to simply admit that the film had its limitations as a commercial product. It would have been more honest.

But it would have been too much to expect from Bollywood. Gully Boy, and mainstream Indian cinema, exists only because of the neoliberal capitalist machine, and is not going to critique it. I personally feel Bollywood is not the site where one can place their hopes for politically responsible art. Maybe I am giving the film too much credit. I know I am biased because of my positionality; it is impossible to watch Gully Boy without measuring it against the lifeblood of Bollywood, without thinking of all the films I have consumed in my childhood, their stifling moral codes and unconvincing worlds. In light of that, Gully Boy feels to me a huge step in an exciting new direction.

Because even when lacking in nuance otherwise, Gully Boy has pushed the possibilities of mainstream Indian cinema creatively: basic questions of what constitutes entertainment, what a narrative looks like, how a story behaves. In an industry which looks down on realist cinema, even a film as promising as That Girl in Yellow Boots fails the imagination by forcing the plot to fall into place. I am not suggesting that exaggeration and absurdity are unequivocally unimaginative, but in Bollywood they have become staple, and therefore lazy. Gully Boy rejects popular cinematic traditions in Bollywood for realism, opening up possibilities for better, more emphatic representation in art: its streets are populated with characters who behave like real people, in a world whose rules we can rely on, in a story that genuinely moves because the script serves its characters and not the other way round. The film does not condescend towards its audience. It allows us to care for Murad’s world, not by explanation but by empathy. What about the politics of empathy -- not just through representation, which Gully Boy has rightfully been critiqued for -- but through craft? By lingering on everyday scenes and dialogues and writing multi-dimensional characters, Gully Boy has shown how to humanise the people we would never know, foster connection through banality and vulnerability, make us aware of our gaze, and open up room for empathy. Empathy politicises art. And all other failures aside, advancing new ways of empathy in Bollywood fundamentally alters what we can expect from mainstream cinema.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/603489-a-thriving-thaana-culture,,The thriving thaana-kuchery culture of Pakistan police,"Haider Ali, a mobile phone technician, wanted to lodge a report with the police about his missing national identity card (CNIC). When he went to Karachi’s Gulistan-i-Jauhar police station, a police guard stopped him at the gate. When Ali described why he had come to the police station, the guard told him that he could not go inside until he loosened his pocket for ‘chai-paani’.

Gulab Shah, a daily-wage worker in Karachi’s Landhi, wanted to lodge a report after he had been mugged. But his family members and friends advised him not to lodge a report because interactions with the police can be frustrating, time-consuming and costly. “First, I will have to pay chai-paani to register the report, and then will have to visit police stations regularly…even though I am a complainant,” he explained.

Shahzeb Salman, a software engineer, wanted to lodge a report about missing leaves from his cheque book. He went to a police station in Karachi’s posh locality of Defence. Nobody stopped him from going inside and the duty officers greeted him well and without further ado lodged the report.

This stark difference in the attitudes of officers at police stations in the country’s major urban centre relates directly to the socio-economic status of the neighbourhoods in their vicinity, and at times, even to personal appearances.

For the past two decades, bringing a change in the thaana culture has become an essential part of political rhetoric. Successive governments have been promising the public a change in the policing culture. Prime Minister Imran Khan excessively uses the rhetoric of changing the thaana-kuchery culture in the country and vows to develop the police force on modern lines.

But on the ground, the situation is very different, where various public surveys and reports show that police are one of the most widely feared and least trusted government institutions in the country. Public fear of the police is one of the main reasons for the limited use of the grievance redress and accountability systems.

On a daily basis, the people are in close contact with the police. They receive and file complaints at police stations and perform duties on public spaces.

Zoha Waseem, a research fellow at University College London, says that police are the first point of contact between the citizens and the state. “It means that every time a citizen walks into a police station to register a complaint, and every time he or she is turned away and an FIR is not filed, or every time a citizen is mistreated and asked for chai paani on a traffic stop or during snap-checking, it becomes a personal issue for that citizen because it challenges his identity and his relationship with the state,” says Waseem, who has carried out extensive fieldwork in Karachi on policing.

In former colonies, such as Pakistan, she says public trust in the police has historically remained low because there is suspicion, scepticism, and violence inbuilt in the intitution’s culture.

“The Pakistani policing system was designed by British colonisers simply to control mobs and ensure that nobody can create any problem for the government in the subcontinent,” says Asad Iqbal Butt, vice chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. “We are still living with this centuries-old colonial police system where the police force has been used as a weapon to rule on the majority of the people.”

Policing is made up of two things: uncovering crime and prevention of crime. “But police cannot do its policing without community or public support in the detection and prevention of the crimes,” says Butt.

Police officers also agree that public fear the police because behaviours of police officers are bad, insulting and intimidating. “It is part of the thaana culture where most of the police personnel believe that if they do not instill fear, people will not accept their authority or respect them,” said a senior police officer in Karachi, requesting anonymity (the Sindh government has recently banned police officers from talking to the media).

Amidst growing concerns surrounding police accountability and lack of public trust in the institution, several initiatives such as the formation of internal police accountability branch in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the enforcement of Punjab Police Efficiency and Discipline Rules 1975 and the Punjab Civil Servants (E&D) Rules 1999 in Punjab, have been taken that are mainly aimed at ‘conducting inquiries against policemen over allegations of corruption, misuse of powers and other complaints in a transparent manner’.

Police officials claim that action against personnel over poor conduct towards people has gradually revived confidence of the people.

In the first six months of 2019, after Dr Kaleem Imam, the Sindh police chief, shared his personal WhatsApp number, asking people to lodge complaints against police officers if they refuse to lodge FIRs or if they demand undue money, hundreds of complaints against police were received. Action was taken against 40 officials – 23 were handed severe punishments while 17 others were given minor punishments. “It was a widely held belief that police can get away with anything and everything. But the police has been trying hard to remove this misconception,” said the police officer in Karachi.

Several initiatives such as setting up of model police stations and facilitation centres, registration of online FIRs, and appointment of SHOs based on their qualification, have been taken aiming at ending the chai-paani or bribery culture thriving at police stations.

Still, experts say that these measures have not helped entirely revive public confidence in the police nor are these sustainable. “Reforms are always personality-driven, which means that most initiatives crash and burn when a chief is replaced,” says Waseem.

Roots International Schools (RIS) organised declamation contest on the theme of ‘Be Bold for Change’ to commemorate ‘International Women’s Day’ here.

The Australian Government in partnership with Trocaire launched the national media advocacy campaign PurAzm last year to highlight the issues around gender-based violence in Pakistan. The PurAzm Campaign ‘Gender Equality-Our Commitment’ is a call to youth, men and women to reaffirm their commitment to promote Gender equality and challenge gender based violence.

The objective of this declamation contest was to create new linkages with diverse and new stakeholders such as corporate sector and educational institutes, to synergize the experience, expertise and platforms of new partners to further expand outreach and awareness for the PurAzm Media Advocacy awareness campaign, engage with youth and create a cadre of young people who can become ‘Ambassadors of the PurAzm Media Campaign’ in educational institutes.

These young people plant the seeds of change by committing themselves to promote the cause of gender equality and challenging gender based violence by participating in various initiatives e.g youth engagement , social media interactions etc.

This thought provoking and interactive ceremony was graced by Mr. John O’ Brien-Country Director Trocaire in Pakistan, Mrs Isharat Jabeen-Programme Manager, Gender Trocaire and Ms. Dilshad Pari, Advocacy Coordinator.

Students articulated their thoughts on this year’s International Women’s day theme “ Be Bold for Change”, followed by a robust interactive discussion endorsing the importance of defining, understanding and promoting gender equality in our society. This interactive session linked the importance of Gender equality to Human rights and motivated their fellow students to get involved and raise awareness on this crucial issue. Ceremony concluded with the distribution of certificates and awards amongst the participants and a commemorative group photograph.

Mr. John O’ Brien-Country Director Trocaire in Pakistan said: “It is the responsibility of the students to take advantage of the excellent education, facilities provided to them, by making positive choices and contributions to the society for gender equality.”

CEO RIS & Rector MIUC Walid Mushtaq shared his views by saying that: “Students can be the most effective tool to eradicate the causes of gender inequality and help change the mindsets surrounding this issue. We provide platform and encourage students for participating in such activities and forums which involve them in community engagement that ultimately helps in country growth and development.”",[],"IslamabadRoots International Schools (RIS) organised declamation contest on the theme of ‘Be Bold for Change’ to commemorate ‘International Women’s Day’ here.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/439329-a-woman-who-speaks-up-for-herself-should-be-appreciated,,‘A woman who speaks up for herself should be appreciated’,"A Karachi Literature Festival session titled ‘Dangerous Women in Dangerous Times’ started off on Saturday with a question: why strong women are called dangerous women.

Literary greats, feminists and people from all walks of life gathered in Room 007 of the Beach Luxury Hotel on the second day of the 10th KLF and the topic was discussed by only one speaker, as airports across Pakistan were partially shut down due to the ongoing tension between Pakistan and India, making it impossible for panelists and speakers to make it to the venue.

Anita M Weiss, a sociologist and a professor of International Studies at the University of Oregon, USA, said dangerous time for a woman could be any moment of being forced to quit studies, a forced marriage, not letting a girl pursue her career or maybe a woman raising her children as a single parent.

She said it seemed to her that the number one characteristic that identified a dangerous woman was one being vocal about her rights during these dangerous times. Whenever a woman does something for herself, there starts objections and criticism, she said.

“Standing up to her own family against forced marriage or saying no to something is all it takes to be a dangerous woman.’’

“Everyone seems uncomfortable instead of appreciating these women. But then, what to do? Certainly not give up. If you are confident that you have a good idea, then you have to work to make the best of it,” Weiss said.

Bismah Aftab, a girl in the audience, shared her struggle of being the only girl among 70 boys in the field of electrical engineering.

“My family and everyone around me warned me when I was choosing this field, and they all said that this field is for boys and not girls. That day, I unheard people and I stood up for my choice, and today I am proudly working as an electrical engineering.”

Nimrah Akram shared a story of her domestic helper, Wajida, who is also a single parent, and how she proved herself to be a “dangerous woman” after being divorced by her husband. Wajida was giving the best possible education to her three daughters by working as a domestic helper and she was a satisfied mother.

Prof Weiss said the women were discouraged all over the world. “It is not only Pakistan but women are discouraged all over the world, especially dangerous women. This idea of rejecting women is now declining due to the feminist movement, but we all have to work together to make this world a better place for human beings, regardless of what the gender is.”

She concluded the session by saying: “Any woman who speaks up and stands out should be appreciated and not discouraged to slowly change the dangerous women’s label to strong women.”",['Saba Habib'],"A Karachi Literature Festival session titled ‘Dangerous Women in Dangerous Times’ started off on Saturday with a question: why strong women are called dangerous women.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/22747-the-distressing-plight-of-nepals-dalit-child-brides,,The distressing plight of Nepal’s Dalit child brides,"Simiko, Nepal: On a freezing night three years ago, 13-year-old Susmita Kami sneaked out of her husband’s house and didn’t stop running until she reached her parent’s doorstep in Nepal’s remote northwest.

Her escape from a forced marriage — a tradition many teenage girls from the Himalayan nation’s Dalit community are expected to uphold — was soon under threat.

But Susmita’s parents resisted demands from her in-laws to send her back, deciding to stand by their pleading daughter who desperately wanted a better life.

“I told them I never wanted to get married and I wasn’t going back. I ran away because I wanted to stay in school,” Susmita, now 16, told AFP.

Although Nepal banned child marriage in 1963, four out of ten girls are married before they turn 18, according to Unicef.

The figures are even higher among the country’s impoverished Dalits or “untouchables” who live in remote communities shunned by the mainstream, meaning their customs go largely unchallenged.

Three out of four Dalits marry during their teens or earlier, according to a 2012 survey by Plan International, Save the Children and World Vision. Girls are often abducted by prospective grooms in a cultural practise few families object to.

Susmita was kidnapped while collecting firewood, and forcibly married four days later — an ordeal also endured by her mother, Jadane Kami, when she was a teenager.

“This is our culture. People worry that otherwise our girls will elope or marry into other communities,” said Kami, who initially did not oppose her daughter’s forced marriage.

The tradition has survived a ten-year civil war, the end of royal rule and Nepal’s transition to democratic politics. In Simikot, headquarters of remote Humla district that borders the Tibetan plateau, Dalits live in segregated settlements.

Their hay-topped homes stand in stark contrast to the shiny tin roofs of houses belonging to higher-caste people.

“Dalits

have struggled due to their low caste status. For centuries, they were not allowed to mix with others at all,” Humla’s deputy district chief, Bam Bahadur KC, told AFP. “Naturally, this has left them very isolated, they are still following old customs and change has been slow to come,” he said.

Dalit families also labour under huge financial strain, officials say, with children pushed to leave school and start work while their parents eke out a living as subsistence farmers.

The oldest of seven children, Dana Sunar, now 18, had been the last Dalit girl in her class. While the others had dropped out, Sunar dreamed of graduating and becoming a schoolteacher. But she was taken at 14 and forced to marry an 18-year-old farmer earning $50 a month.

“I cried and cried. It was like a door had closed before me, any dreams I had were gone,” Sunar said. Her in-laws pressured her to drop out of school and focus on farming and housework. Now a mother to six-month-old twins, Sunar described her new life as “a daily struggle”.

“We never have enough money - sometimes we eat only once a day. I don’t know how I am going to bring up these children,” she said.

Experts say the consequences of marrying so young are devastating.“Adolescents have children early, they are unable to focus on education...and both mothers and babies end up with health problems,” said Kunga Sanduk Lama, a government official who works on child rights.

Laws are ineffective, he said, citing a lack of evidence — documents, photos or witness testimonies — needed to prove a marriage occurred so punitive action can be pursued.

Instead, campaigners focus on raising awareness through radio shows, street plays and after-school clubs for children. Those who have fallen victim to the tradition need no convincing. Susmita, now in ninth grade, said she wanted to see an end to “this terrible custom.”

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/737338-plea-for-moving-christian-girl-to-shelter-home-dismissed,,Plea for moving Christian girl to shelter home dismissed,"A local court on Saturday dismissed the plea moved by the family of an allegedly forcibly converted Christian girl named Arzoo to send her to a shelter home, thereby releasing her from the custody of her Muslim spouse.

The family claims that Syed Azhar Ali had abducted the 13-year-old girl with the help of his brothers Syed Shariq Ali and Syed Mohsin Ali and friend Danish, forced her to convert to Islam and then married her.

On Thursday a judicial magistrate had granted bail to Shariq, Mohsin and Danish, while the Sindh High Court (SHC) had restrained the police from arresting Azhar.

At the outset of the hearing on Saturday, Arzoo’s father Raja submitted an application to District South Judicial Magistrate-XXIII Ali Muhammad Dall pleading to send Arzoo to a shelter home because he claimed that his daughter was not safe with Azhar.

Raja cited Rule 5 of the Child Marriage Restraint Rules, read with rules 8, 9 and 10 of the Child Marriage Restraint Act, read with Section 100 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

The father’s attorney Advocate Jibran Nasir argued that the girl was 13 years old and the provisions of the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act have also been incorporated in the matter by the police.

He said the SHC had not restrained the trial court from exercising its powers in accordance with the law, pleading the magistrate to issue orders to move the girl to safety because she might be subjected to rape in her alleged husband’s custody.

He also said that any delay in the matter can amount to an offence punishable under Section 376 (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Section 375(v) (Rape: with or without her consent when she is under 16 years of age).

The lawyer said that Rule 9 of the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Rules 2016 also empowers the trial court to issue a writ for the production of the victim in the present matter.

He asked the court to issue a search warrant for the production of the girl before the trial court and to send her to a shelter home. He said the complainant only demands Arzoo’s safety. State prosecutor Abdul Rahim Thahim seconded the version of the complainant’s counsel Nasir.

The investigating officer, Inspector Shariq Ahmed Siddiqui, said the girl is under the protection of the SHO of the Preedy police station in compliance with the SHC’s order.

He added that the documents submitted by the girl’s father as regards her age have been verified through the National Database & Registration Authority and they stand genuine.

After listening to the arguments, the judge concluded that it appears that an SHC division bench has already directed the Preedy SHO to provide protection to the girl through its order dated October 27, so the matter is now fixed before the same on November 11.

“It may be mentioned that,” reads the local court’s order, “this court is not even competent to discuss the merits or proprietary of the 27-10-2020 order of the Sindh High Court passed in CP No. D-5364 of 2020.”

The order said that allowing the prayer of the learned counsel for the complainant will also amount to the quashing of the above-mentioned order, dated October 27, of the double bench of the SHC.

“In the light of the facts and reasons as mentioned above, this application finds no merits and stands dismissed accordingly,” concluded the order issued by the local court.","['Oc', 'Our Correspondent']","A local court on Saturday dismissed the plea moved by the family of an allegedly forcibly converted Christian girl named Arzoo to send her to a shelter home, thereby releasing her from the custody of her Muslim spouse.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/114074-Russia-accuses-Syrian-opposition-of-using-blackmail-at-Geneva-talks%3A+com%2FYEor+,,Russia accuses Syrian opposition of using blackmail at Geneva talks,"MOSCOW: Russia on Wednesday accused the Saudi-backed Syrian opposition of employing blackmail by suspending its participation in peace talks in Geneva.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said the tactics deployed by the High Negotiations Committee showed it was not capable of reaching a deal and could not be the sole representative for the opposition at the talks.

""The Geneva forum should be a ´workshop´ for agreeing on the outlines of Syria´s future secular statehood and for determining the ways of reaching that, but not an ´eastern bazaar´ with elements of crude blackmail in respect of the international community,"" the ministry said in a statement.

""By issuing ultimatums, the Riyadh group, it seems, is trying to mask the fact it has no concrete and realistic proposals.

""Russia spoke out after a Western diplomat warned the fragile peace talks might not resume for at least a year if they were abandoned now and as the opposition urged more military support for rebels after declaring a truce was over.

The Russian statement described as groundless opposition allegations that forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were violating an agreement on a cessation of hostilities and on granting access for humanitarian supplies.

""It turns out that certain opposition forces and those external forces which are their patrons are continuing to rely exclusively on achieving their own plans and clearly inflated ambitions, acting on the principle ´all or nothing´,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said.

The actions of the Saudi-backed opposition underlined the importance of having other moderate opposition groups participate in the talks, it said.

The ministry said it supported the decision of Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations envoy to the talks, to carry on with the negotiations despite the decision of the High Negotiations Committee to suspend its participation.",[],"MOSCOW: Russia on Wednesday accused the Saudi-backed Syrian opposition of employing blackmail by suspending its participation in peace talks in Geneva.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/268098-judicial-response-to-gender-based-violence,,Judicial response to gender-based violence,"The Human Rights Watch in their 1999 report explain how such customary practices sometimes even influenced the court's verdict: ""The Court explained that the Quranic verse 34 of Sura Al-Nisa establishes men as the ""custodian of women""; hence a man who kills another man for defiling the honour of his wife or daughter is protecting his property and acting in self-defence. Quoting Sura Al-Nisa, the judge concluded, ""I am of the view that the appellant, as the custodian of honour of his wife, had the right to kill the deceased while he was engaged in [a] sex act with his wife and he had not earned liability of qisas or tazir or even diyat, and is hereby acquitted .""""

The afore-referred opinion reflects a misinterpretation and not a correct understanding of the religious tenet on the issue. Because Islam does not stand for taking the law into one's hand. The practice of 'honour killing' is a form of murder without trial, which is contrary to Islam. Islam upholds the sanctity of human life, as the Holy Quran declares that killing one innocent human being is akin to killing the entire human race. ""In reality, honour killings are a direct outcome of forced marriages and have nothing to do with Islam.

Indeed, one of the first acts of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was to condemn and forbid such practices. In Islam, honour is connected with virtue, with righteous behaviour, obligations to one's parents and the elderly, good works and community development. It is all about human dignity and how that dignity should be upheld. For many Muslims, however, Islamic ideals are often subservient to tribal custom. Honour killings and forced marriages are tribal practices. Among certain tribes in Asia, honour is associated with women: izzat, as honour is called in Urdu, is quite literally located on the female body .""

The victim of honour-based crime is stigmatised and therefore isolated. This crime is distinct from other forms of violence because of its collective nature –

actions are often condoned and kept secret by the family and community. Young people are particularly vulnerable .""

The right to marry – a vindication: The United Nations describes the practice of forced marriages as a ""contemporary form of slavery"". Forced Marriages and crimes in the name of honour cannot be separated from one another. Both practices are forms of violence which primarily affect girls and women and are grounded in a patriarchal image of family honour. Forced marriage is a complete negation of the Islamic concept of marriage. Instances are not lacking from Hadith (sayings and deeds of Holy Prophet Muhammad) where consent of a sui juris woman was held to be a sine qua non for a valid marriage in absence of which the marriage was declared void. Once a woman complained to the Holy Prophet that her marriage had been enacted against her consent. The Holy Prophet (PBUH) annulled the marriage.

There is yet another well-quoted incident. A woman by the name of Qaylah bil Makhramah had several daughters. After the death of her husband, the latter's brother-in-law seized all the daughters and declared that he would marry them to men of his choice. The widow, accompanied by her eldest daughter, went to Prophet Muhammad and reported her grievance. The Holy Prophet commanded, ""Qaylah and daughters of Qaylah should not be oppressed or forced to marry. Every faithful Muslim should offer them help."" As a consequence the widow's brother-in-law Althub had to let her daughters go and they ultimately married of their own free will.

In Pakistan tribal and feudal customs relating to women's rights particularly marital rights are undergoing a change through progressive legislation and liberal interpretation of the law. ""The Muslim Family Law Ordinance (MFLO) is the main body of law regulating marriage in Pakistan. The MFLO mainly deals with the procedural aspects of marriage, meaning that the courts enjoy wide discretionary power to decide what the substantive, uncodified Muslim personal law says. It follows that unlike legislation in many other Muslim countries, Pakistani law is silent as to the right of an adult woman to marry a person of her choice and as to whether her consent to marriage is sufficient or even required as a prerequisite for its validity."" This void is being filled by the Judge-made law.

One of the onerous functions of the courts established under the constitution, particularly the Supreme Court, has been to bridge the gap between the law and the dynamics of social change. In holding that a marriage in Islam is a consensual arrangement and a civil contract, the courts have made women equal partners in marriage. In the case of Mst Khurshid Bibi v Baboo Muhammad Amin, the Court declared, ""As is well-settled, marriage in Muslims is not a sacrament, but in the nature of civil contract. Such a contract undoubtedly has spiritual and moral overtones and undertones, but legally, in essence, it remains a contract between the parties which can be the subject of dissolution for good. In this, Islam, the din-al-fitrat, conforms to the dictates of human nature and does not prescribe the binding together of a man and a woman to what has been described as ""holy deadlock"".

In Hafiz Abdul Waheed v Asma Jehangir , the Court candidly held that an adult woman can enter into a marriage of her own choice without the consent of any guardian.

In Mst Humaira Mehmood v the State , the court unequivocally declared that a forced marriage is neither recognised in religion nor in law and that a woman's consent is imperative for a valid marriage.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/714717-authorities-continue-search-for-prime-suspect-in-motorway-rape-case,,Authorities continue search for prime suspect in motorway gang rape case,"Authorities continue to carry out raids for the arrest of key suspect in the motorway gang rape case, Abid Ali, who continues to remain at large.



Meanwhile, Waqarul Hassan, the other suspect in the case identified by the Punjab government, had surrendered himself on Sunday at Lahore's Model Town police station. He claimed that his brother-in-law was using the mobile phone which had wrongly implicated him in the crime, adding that he himself was not involved.

Police shared on Monday that further investigations have suggested that Waqarul Hasan may indeed not have been involved, adding that a final decision on the matter will be taken after they receive the DNA report of the suspect.

The police said Waqar had revealed that prime suspect Abid used to commit crimes along with an individual named Shafqat. They added that Waqar told them that Shafqat was a resident of Bahawalnagar and a friend of Abid.

The police said that they have dispatched teams to Bahawalnagar and Sheikhupura for the arrest of Shafqat following the revelation by Waqar. They also shared that the police has also arrested the brother-in-law and other relatives of prime suspect Abid Ali.

Chohan compares motorway rape case with Zainab case

Punjab’s Information Minister Fayyaz ul Hasan Chohan, when asked about the delay in the arrest of Abid Ali, compared the case to the 2018 rape and murder of seven-year-old Zainab.

“Even three years ago when the Zainab rape case happened, it took three months to get hold of the culprits although the province had used all of its powers to get hold of the culprits,” reminded Chohan while speaking to Geo Pakistan.

The minister said that Abid Ali had committed rape for the first time in June 2013 and a first information report (FIR) was lodged against him but he was released after some time during Shahbaz Sharif’s government. He also shared that the forensic report had also been finalised months after his release.

He recalled that police have carried out geofencing of the area and have been working day and night with 28 teams on the case. He also shared that the law enforcement agency was able to identify Abid Ali “within 72 hours”.

“Yesterday, Waqarul Hassan surrendered after the police closely tracked him down. The police should be given credit where it is due,” said Chohan.

Talking about laws regarding protection of women and children, the minister said that there were a lot of laws for the safety of women and children ""but they are never implemented”.

“This is my personal opinion, not the government’s stance, but I think the rapists should be punished publicly after fulfilling all legal terms,” said the minister. He added if this does not happen then a speedy investigation and prosecution should be done.

Parents' appeal to authorities

Meanwhile, speaking to Geo News, Waqar's mother said that her son is innocent and that he decided to surrender himself after he got to know of the incident.

""If my son had done something wrong, he wouldn't have surrendered himself,"" she said. The suspect's mother appealed to Chief Minister Usman Buzdar to ensure justice is served in Waqar's case.

""My son is a pious and religious person, his life should be spared,"" she said, adding: ""He runs a motorcycle repairing shop in Qilla Sattar Shah.""

""If my son was a culprit, why would he present himself [to the law enforcement agencies],"" she asked.

The mother said that she has four daughters and two sons and one of her sons was ill.

Meanwhile, Waqar's father said that his son is not a ""thief"" and ""works at a shop"".

He said Waqar is ""innocent"" and appealed to the authorities to release him.

Rs2.5 million reward

On Saturday, Chief Minister Punjab Usman Buzdar had announced a reward of Rs2.5 million for each of the suspects if information leading to their arrest is shared. He said that the identity of those bringing forward any information will be kept confidential.

""We worked day and night and launched a probe using scientific techniques. I personally monitored the progress and directed the completion of the probe expediently,"" Buzdar had said.

According to the chief minister, seven cases — including two gang-rape cases — were registered against Abid, while two robbery cases were filed against Waqar who was reportedly released 14 days earlier on bail.

Buzdar said that the culprits will be given exemplary punishment for the heinous crime.

While briefing the media about how the police identified the suspects, Inspector General of Police Inam Ghani had said, ""Geo-fencing of the entire area was carried out, data was taken from the Election Commission of Pakistan, fingerprints were taken from the site, and DNA tests were conducted"".

IGP Ghani said that after the police went through the records they had gathered they got to know that Abid Ali had four SIMs registered in his name that he used on several occasions. All of the SIMs, however, were currently non-functional.

""Ultimately, we tracked down another number — that was not registered to his name — and it proved our suspicions right. Through this number, we were able to reach his partner as well,"" he said.

The Punjab police chief added: ""We are 95% sure that [the person we have tracked down] is his partner as his phone signals were traced to the location of the crime [at the time of the incident].""

The incident

On Wednesday night, it was reported that two robbers had allegedly gang-raped a mother of two on the Lahore-Sialkot motorway in an area falling within Gujjarpura police's jurisdiction.

The woman, along with her two children, was driving to Gujranwala when she was forced to stop at the Gujjarpura section of the motorway after running out of fuel, at around 1:30am.

She immediately called a relative and sent him her location. He asked her to also dial the Motorway Police helpline 130 from which she reportedly received no response.

In the meantime, two robbers reportedly approached the car, broke the window, and took the woman and her children to nearby bushes where they allegedly raped her in front of the children.

They also allegedly snatched her purse carrying Rs100,000 in cash, one bracelet, car registration papers, and three ATM cards.",[],"Authorities continue to carry out raids for the arrest of key suspect in the motorway gang rape case, Abid Ali, who continues to remain at large.
The police said Waqar had revealed that prime suspect Abid used to commit crimes along with an individual named Shafqat.
They also shared that the police has also arrested the brother-in-law and other relatives of prime suspect Abid Ali.
Chohan compares motorway rape case with Zainab casePunjab’s Information Minister Fayyaz ul Hasan Chohan, when asked about the delay in the arrest of Abid Ali, compared the case to the 2018 rape and murder of seven-year-old Zainab.
He also shared that the law enforcement agency was able to identify Abid Ali “within 72 hours”.","['continue', 'waqar', 'suspect', 'case', 'search', 'minister', 'shared', 'ali', 'motorway', 'rape',

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/610626-na-passes-resolution-for-public-hanging-of-child-abuse-convicts,,NA passes resolution for public hanging of child abuse convicts,"By News Desk

ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly approved on Friday with a sizable majority a resolution demanding public hanging of the child abuse convicts.

The resolution was tabled in the lower house of the parliament by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) lawmaker and Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan. He said Prime Minister Imran Khan wanted hanging punishment for the child abuse convicts.

“When we raised the issue of public hanging in the National Assembly’s standing committee on human rights headed by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari it was opposed,” the minister said, adding the government desired a new law aimed at the hanging of the convicts.

He further asked the opposition if it was ready to support the bill or not. Another PTI lawmaker Imran Khattak also seconded the demand for adopting the resolution calling for public hanging of child abuse convicts.

Former prime minister and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) parliamentarian Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, however, opposed the move, saying the country had signed a United Nations Charter against public hangings and if it was adopted then the world would not accept it.

Federal Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry also shared his views on Twitter, opposing the resolution. “Strongly condemn this resolution. This is just another grave act in line with brutal civilisation practices [sic]. Societies [should] act in a balanced way, [barbarity] is not an answer to crimes. This is another expression of extremism,” he wrote.

Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari also spoke out against the resolution. “The resolution passed in NA today on public hangings was across party lines and not a govt-sponsored resolution but an individual act. Many of us oppose it — our Ministry of Human Rights strongly opposes this. Unfortunately, I was in a meeting and was not able to go to NA,” she said on Twitter. The Amnesty International on Friday condemned the passage of the resolution in the parliament, saying public hangings were acts of unconscionable cruelty. “The sexual abuse and murder of children are among the most horrific crimes, but the death penalty is not a solution. Public hangings are acts of unconscionable cruelty and have no place in a rights-respecting society,” said Amnesty International’s Deputy South Asia Director Omar Waraich.",[],"By News DeskISLAMABAD: The National Assembly approved on Friday with a sizable majority a resolution demanding public hanging of the child abuse convicts.

The Punjab government developed the PWDP 2018 to systematically eradicate all manifestations of explicit and implicit gender discrimination across all spheres of society and address the whole range of women development concerns and challenges in line with the spirit of the Constitution, Pakistan’s international commitments and priorities of the provincial government to pursue the goal of gender mainstreaming and women empowerment in Punjab.

Minister Women Development Ashifa Riaz Fatyana, in her keynote address, expressed her optimism that the framework will play a key role in changing realities in women’s favour in the province.

Ambreen Raza, Secretary WDD said, “This framework will bring us closer to our vision of a gender-sensitive Punjab, where women and men enjoy equity and equality in all walks of life; women and girls are able to fulfill their roles towards achieving and enjoying individual and collective well-being, development and prosperity without any explicit or implicit discrimination.”

Sidra Minhas, Consultant UN Women, presented highlights of the framework identifying gender disaggregated data collection, capacity building and awareness as key activities for all relevant departments.

Jacqui Ketunuti, Deputy Country Representative UN Women Pakistan, in her opening remarks said, “It is a matter of great pride for us that, with the strong and capable leadership of the WDD, 36 provincial departments came together and endorsed the integration of activities in their work plans to ensure that Punjab can make progress on gender equality in the thematic areas of political empowerment, education, health, economic empowerment, gender-based violence, climate change and ICT. This is the first and largest such initiative for gender mainstreaming in the province.”

It is enlightening to see TV projects taking up subjects that used to be kept under wraps earlier. However, it is also a concern if these projects will be able to do justice to these delicate and timely issues. For instance, an issue as sensitive as child abuse needs careful handling and may end up hurting the victims otherwise.

Multiple Pakistani TV plays have highlighted the issue lately including dramas like Udaari and Muqabil, and after the recent Kasur incident that claimed the life of young Zainab, a telefilm is also in the works. While the plays kept it subtle and also helped in raising some awareness, we aren’t sure how the upcoming telefilm is going to treat the subject.

That said, another upcoming drama is also taking up a similar theme and aims to shed light on the subject without playing with anyone’s sentiments. The untitled project is being directed by Ali Hassan of Muqabil fame and features Mohsin Abbas Haider, Sonya Hussyn, Sania Saeed and Sajid Hassan in important roles.

“It is not specifically about Zainab but tackles the issue of child abuse in general,” Mohsin Abbas Haider told Instep in a telephonic conversation. “Given the sensitivity of the subject, it is very difficult and challenging to play such a character but I consider it a responsibility. Instead of just speaking up against these issues, I think it is better to associate myself with such a project that allows me to present things as they are. We have made sure we treat the subject as per religious and legal policies and also take care of the facts and figures.”

The actor also informed that they have shot the first spell of the project and it will go on air after Ramazan.

“We want exemplary punishment for the cleric, who had assaulted a seminary student and those who harboured him after this heinous crime,” Mohammad Shoaib, the former president of traders’ union, told the protesters who had gathered outside the Ghazikot Township here.

The protesters were holding banners and placards inscribed with slogans in support of their demands. They demanded the arrest of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) leader Mufti Kifayatullah who, according to them, had provided shelter to the suspect before his arrest in the assault case of a seminary student.

The children were also holding placards inscribed with a slogan ‘No mercy for child rapists’.

Turkey, refusing to bow to European Union demands to rein in its broad anti-terror laws, said on Friday talks on a deal to provide visa-free travel in return for stopping illegal migrants reaching the EU had reached an impasse and the bloc must find a ""new formula"" to salvage the agreement.

Merkel, whose popularity has suffered due to her liberal migrant policy that saw Germany take in more than one million migrants last year, had spearheaded EU efforts to secure the deal, signed in March.

While the numbers of migrants have dropped sharply this year, Merkel continues to attract criticism from her conservative allies in Bavaria as well as the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD).

""I´m not against talks with Turkey but I think it´s dangerous to become so dependent on Ankara,"" said Horst Seehofer, leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party to Merkel´s Christian Democrats (CDU).

Seehofer told Welt am Sonntag (WamS) that the deal with Turkey had helped boost support for AfD, which is currently polling at up to 15 per cent.

Sahra Wagenknecht of the opposition far-left Linke party told the same newspaper Merkel had essentially negotiated the deal without involving her European partners.

""The chancellor is therefore responsible for Europe having become vulnerable to being blackmailed by the authoritarian Turkish regime and for Erdogan feeling noticeably strengthened to crush human rights underfoot,"" she said.

Cem Oezdemir, co-leader of the Greens party and the son of Turkish immigrants, also told WamS the deal had put Europe at risk of being blackmailed and said Merkel was largely to blame.

While the EU is desperate for the deal to succeed, it also insists that Turkey meet 72 criteria, including anti-terror laws which it says Turkey uses to stifle dissent. Ankara says it needs sweeping legislation to fight Kurdish insurgents and Islamic State.

Merkel is due to attend the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul on May 23 and there are plans for bilateral talks with other leaders in attendance, her spokesman said on Friday.

Members of the Social Democrats (SPD), Merkel´s junior coalition partner, also expressed concern.

Carsten Schneider told WamS Merkel had made Erdogan the key to her refugee policy and if he stopped cooperating, ""the extent of Germany´s isolation in Europe will become clear again"", while Thorsten Schaefer-Guembel said Merkel should not ""kowtow"" to Erdogan.

But SPD Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told Tagesspiegel newspaper Turkey was still the key country for migration to Europe, adding: ""We need to cooperate to some extent if we want to avoid the circumstances we had last year.""

Merkel has drawn heavy criticism for allowing German prosecutors to pursue a case against a German comedian at the Turkish leader´s behest. The comic had recited a sexually crude poem about Erdogan.",[],"BERLIN: German politicians accused Chancellor Angela Merkel at the weekend of making Europe overly dependent on Turkey in the migrant crisis, leaving the bloc vulnerable to blackmail by President Tayyip Erdogan.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/464780-landmark-legislation-aimed-at-ending-early-marriages-in-sindh-being-poorly-implemented,,‘Landmark legislation aimed at ending early marriages in Sindh being poorly implemented’,"Although the Sindh government takes credit for becoming the country’s first elected assembly to have passed a bill on child marriages in April 2014, which places a ban on marriage of children under 18 years and makes its a violation punishable with rigorous imprisonment of up to three years, sadly the law is still poorly implemented, said rights activists.

The Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act 2013, a landmark piece of legislation, is aimed at ending early marriages in Sindh.

The issue of the implementation of the law restraining child marriages has once again been in the limelight and is being hotly debated by different circles after the emergence of alleged cases of forced conversions in rural Sindh.

On Sunday, a meeting of rights activists from across the province gathered in Khairpur to discuss the implementation and the enactment of new laws to protect religious minorities and again recommended the government to strictly implement the child marriages law.

Fareeda Tahir, an official working at the Strengthening Participatory Organisation (SPO) in Karachi, said child marriage destroys society as a whole as well as the life of a girl. “It deprives her of education, right to development and growth and exposes her to health risks and gender-based violence,” she told The News.

She said that the issue was from both sides – government and society. “The government lacks priority to address women issues. The government notified district-level monitoring committees, but in fact they are not functional,” she said.

Tahir said that social norms, family pressure, weak enforcement of the law, patriarchal system and poverty were the main reasons behind child marriages. The SPO along with civil society activists has also been working to ask the provincial government to implement the act properly.

There are no reliable statistics on the number of child marriages in Pakistan as few cases are reported to the police and the government does not track the issue. On April 7, two teenage girls who were allegedly forced to marry older men from within their community were recovered by police officials in the Kaloi town of the Tharparkar district.

In order to ensure an effective check on early marriages, it must be made binding upon Nikah registrars to see that the groom and the bride contracting wedlock do have a genuine computerised national identity cards (CNIC) as under the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act-2013 the marriage of a person under 18 years of age is unlawful, said Javed Hussain of the Sindh Community Foundation.

The police should also play their role in restraining underage marriages by invoking relevant sections of the law while registering an FIR against offenders, he said. Pakistan ranks sixth in the world in terms of the highest absolute numbers of child marriage where 21 percent of girls are married by the age of 18, according to a report titled ‘Ending impunity for child marriages in Pakistan: Normative and implementation gaps’. This report was prepared by the global advocacy group, the Centre for Reproductive Rights, and released in Karachi in September last year.

The report also found that child marriage impacts girls more than boys because it makes them susceptible to domestic violence and reproductive health issues. The report recommended underage marriages should be declared null and void, penalties should be imposed on officials, including police and magistrates, who fail to take preventive or protective actions, and access provided to legal and other services to victims of child marriages.",['Zia Ur Rehman'],"The Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act 2013, a landmark piece of legislation, is aimed at ending early marriages in Sindh.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/399515-women-in-conflict-areas-the-case-of-kashmir,,Women in conflict areas: the case of Kashmir,"UN Women is all set to mark 16 days of activism against gender-based violence but unfortunately it has failed to include violence against women in conflict zones within this agenda. Yet this is a critical aspect of violence against women and its impact on family and societal structures.

Ironically, given the recent scandals that have emerged regarding abuse of women in conflict areas by UN peacekeepers, UN Women should have focused on gender-based violence in conflicts, especially unconventional conflicts involving state and non-state actors.

Conflict situations always create risks for women, particularly in the context of abuse and exploitation, both directly, where women are specifically targeted, and indirectly because conflict leads to a breakdown in the structure of the family. So conflicts, especially unconventional ones, destroy the core group of society – the family. And it can take decades after the conflict is over to recover from this destruction. Ever since the centre of gravity of wars – conventional and unconventional – shifted from the armed forces to civilian populations, women and children have become part of the targeting strategies. Yet in processes aimed at ending wars and resolving conflicts, women have been left out of the mainstream of stakeholders involved in peace making.

In October 2000, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1325 on “Women, Peace and Security”, which recognised the need to understand the consequences of armed conflict on women and girls so that institutional arrangements could be developed and strengthened to guarantee not only their safety but also the participation of women in the peace process. Of course, different regions of the world produce their own unique problems and needs relating to women in conflict areas. The ICRC, recognising this, stated in a report following UNSC Resolution 1325 that “the effect of war on women is not only determined by the character and stage of the conflict, but also by the particular role of each woman caught up in it”. In other words, “it is vital to respond to women’s particular needs – be they combatants, persons deprived of their freedom, refugees, IDPs, mothers and/or members of the civilian population”.

In Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK), women have been severely affected by the struggle against Indian occupation, but women have remained outside of the political dialogues so that their specific issues and concerns are denied the centrality they deserve. For instance, although Kashmiri women have become deliberate targets of the Indian security forces through the use of rape as a weapon of war, they are yet to come to the forefront as primary stakeholders in any discussion on conflict resolution.

The International Criminal Tribunals of Yugoslavia and Rwanda (ICTY and ICTR) first highlighted the concept of rape as a weapon of war, and rape has been systematically and persistently used by the Indian army against Kashmiri women. One reason why this has kept recurring is because of the culture of impunity that prevails. For instance, in May 1990, a young woman, Mubina Gani, was raped. An inquiry was conducted which found that the rape had indeed occurred but the officials responsible were never prosecuted. A few months later, in July 1990, a case was registered against Border Security Force officials for the rape of a 24-year old woman, Hasina. No investigation was carried out in this case, let alone prosecution.

Who can forget the horrific rape of a young girl in a temple in IOK by Indian security forces? Nor has it been just individual cases of rape by individual Indian security personnel. There were the two incidents of mass rape committed by Indian soldiers in the villages of Poshpora and Kunan in February 1991 when Indian security forces entered the villages and separated the men from the women before proceeding to rape the latter. Although the survivors have been fighting for justice in the Indian courts, so far justice has eluded them.

Such impunity is systemic as was highlighted in 2013 by Rashida Manjoo, the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, its Causes and Consequences. She noted how the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act 1990 granted special powers to the Indian security forces, which resulted in a lack of accountability and redress for victims of human rights violations. She especially emphasised how the Army Act 1950 “limits the scope for civil courts to consider allegations of violence against women perpetrated by army officials, including killings and sexual violence”.

However, women also suffer indirectly in conflict situations because, when the male breadwinner is no longer alive, female-headed households face innumerable challenges of survival, which impacts the education and health of the entire family. It is in this context that the issue of ‘enforced disappearances’ becomes critical – especially because there is no closure for the family. That is why when states move towards democracy from authoritarianism, not only must enforced disappearances end – for families to have closure – but some form of a truth and reconciliation commission must also be created to bring closure to families.

In fact enforced disappearances, especially where special draconian powers are given to the LEAs and the military, as has been the case in IOK, are also a major source of the victimisation and psychological torture of families (This issue requires a separate article or paper, which will soon be forthcoming in a wider context beyond Kashmir). Again, in Kashmir the issue of enforced disappearances has led to the creation of the term ‘half widows’ – women whose husbands have disappeared but have not been declared deceased. These ‘half widows’ tend to live impoverished lives, confronted with socio-economic and psychological uncertainties such as lack of property rights and the right to remarry.

However, if the Indian occupation security forces had calculated that the targeting of women would result in a loss of will on the part of the Kashmiris to continue their struggle for liberation from Indian Occupation and demand their right to self determination, their calculations could not have been more erroneous. Women in Kashmir have fought back against the violence perpetrated against them – since 2014, on every February 23, ‘Kashmiri Women’s Resistance Day’ is commemorated as this was the day on which the mass rape and torture of women was carried out after a large-scale military attack in the villages of Poshpora and Kunan.

Unfortunately, not enough attention is focused on the gender dimension of the violence being perpetrated by the Indian occupation forces in IOK. Issues of sexual violence, trafficking, enforced prostitution, children born as a consequence of sexual violence and suffering trauma and stigmatization – all these are the fallout from the human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian laws by the Indian state. Pakistan has failed to raise these issues in international organisations dealing specifically with women in conflict situations as it seeks international support for implementation of UNSC resolutions on Kashmir. As for the democratic world, for all its claims to upholding human rights values, it has been criminally silent on Indian atrocities in IOK, especially the use of rape as a deliberate weapon of war by Indian security forces.

The writer is the federal minister for human rights.

The bill further to amend the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 [The Criminal Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2020 (Insertion of new Section 297A)] was moved by PML-N Senator Muhammad Javed Abbasi, which was not opposed by the government on a private members day.

He explained that harshest punishment was imperative for curbing the diabolical act of taking out dead bodies from graves and subjecting them to sexual crime. Likewise, another bill, introduced by JI Senator Sirajul Haq, was tabled in the House and referred to the committee concerned of the House.

The proposed bill seeks to amend Article 93 of the Constitution to make it mandatory on advisors to also take oath like ministers. The JI senator said the proposed amendment would make it binding on an advisor to be held answerable before the Parliament.

He moved another bill to amend the Zainab Alert Law to also make the police officer or any other involved in probing a child rape or murder case seen to be showing negligence. It was also referred to the House committee concerned.

State Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan said a draft bill was brought in the Cabinet, which was sent to the Ministry of Law, which made the state petitioner in a rape or molestation case.

The Senate was moved to enable the Senate Chairman and NA Speaker to chip in and decide on appointment of chief election commissioner and members of the Election Commission of Pakistan if the prime minister and leader of opposition and the parliamentary committee remain inconclusive on their nominations. The bill was introduced by Sirajul Haq.

JI Senator Mushtaq Ahmad moved a bill for amending the Anti-Terrorism Act to ensure that in case of legislation relating to FATF, money laundering and terror financing, foreign pressure must not be accepted, natural justice be ensured and national interests protected.

The bill was opposed by the government but Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani referred it to the House committee concerned after taking sense of the House. The House passed an amendment to the Pakistan Press Council Ordinance, opening doors on others, lawyers and journalists to be candidates for the post of PPC chairman. Previously, only a retired judge of the Supreme Court could head it.

The bill was brought by Senator Javed Abbasi and approved by the House panel concerned. Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Senator Shibli Faraz charged the opposition had made a blatant constitutional violation during the PDM pubic meeting in Quetta, of which PPP was also a component. However, he was met with sloganeering by some opposition senators as he tried to respond to the PPP parliamentary leader in the Senate Sherry Rehman and Senator Mian Raza Rabbani’s strong objection to further empowering the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority through an amendment bill, moved by PTI Senator Faisal Javed, who also heads the House standing committee concerned.

Senators Sherry and Rabbani questioned the logic behind empowering the Pemra more, which amounted to allowing it to get into private entities in the name of job security of media persons.",['Mumtaz Alvi'],"ISLAMABAD: A bill proposing death sentence or at least life imprisonment to anyone abusing a dead body was moved in the Senate on Monday and referred to the House standing committee concerned for deliberation and report.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/158156-the-sorry-story-of-political-blackmail-of-a-72-year-old-lady,,The sorry story of political blackmail of a 72-year old lady,"ISLAMABAD: The chairman of a Senate standing committee has been almost caught red-handed while trying to deprive a 72-year-old lady of her only but expensive F-7 bungalow in Islamabad and the story of the legal and physical abuse and torture depicts the plight of all those citizens who are victims of the powerful political elite of this country.



In this gory drama of illegal misuse of power, outright fraud, cheating and use of blackmail and physical force, The News talked to all the parties concerned, met them several times, saw the documents they provided, some of which turned out to be fake later, and found that the old lady and her 90-year-old husband had become victims of brute political influence.



Senator Talha Mahmood Aryan, Chairman Senate Standing Committee on Interior, a ruling-JUI-F senator, has been occupying the house of the old woman in a posh Sector F-7 of Islamabad for the last seven years and not ready to vacate it despite high court and lower court’s verdicts while the whole Islamabad Police is openly siding with the chairman of the Senate interior committee.



Senator Talha, when approached by The News, provided some documents for proving the legality of his occupation of the house. However, all these documents given by Talha to this correspondent proved fake. When the documents provided by Talha to The News were found fake, a close friend of Talha, associated with the issue, approached this scribe and asked to mediate and close the issue.



Adviser on Interior Rehman Malik, when approached by The News and asked about the failure of the police to get the house vacated from illegal occupation of Chairman Senate Standing Committee on Interior despite higher court’s orders, said: “First, I have no knowledge of anything regarding Talha’s story. Secondly, I could only be held responsible for anything if the woman who is owner of the house visited my office and I did not help her in getting justice.”



According

to official website of the Senate of Pakistan, Muhammad Talha Mahmood Aryan is resident of House No.13-A, St-61, F-7/4, Islamabad. According to documentary evidences available with The News, Talha has taken this house on rent from its owner Ms Bilqees Israr in Feb 2002. According to contract signed by both the parties, the contract was for a period of four years while the rent was decided at the rate of Rs 25000/- per month. A clause of the agreement says that if the owner (Bilqees) wanted to vacate the house, she will have to serve a one-month notice. According to Bilqees, one of her sons returned to Pakistan after completing his specialization from Ireland and needed a residence in Islamabad, so she served a vacation notice on Talha Mahmood in 2003.



According to documentary evidence, Talha, instead of vacating the house, went to the court of civil judge from where the case was transferred to the court of Rent Controller/Civil Judge. Talha, according to Bilqees, presented a tampered agreement in the court, which shows that agreement was for a period of twenty years, with the rent Rs 25,000/- per month, which could be increased by 10% only after every five years. The court of Civil Judge/Rent Controller decided in favour of Bilqees Israr on the basis of Talha’s default and breaching the agreement and ordered him (Talha) to immediately vacate the house.



Talha, again instead of vacating the house approached District Judge where the decision was made in his favour. On this, Ms Bilqees approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and pleaded for the vacation of her house, which she had rented out for four years and was trying to get it vacated for the last seven years.



The IHC on Sep 9, 2008, decided the matter in favour of Bilqees, declared Senator Talha as defaulter and restored the verdict passed by the Rent Controller ordering Senator Talha Mahmood to immediately vacate the house. When Senator Talha didn’t vacate the house despite the IHC orders, a bailiff of IHC raided H-13-A on Nov 27th but was unable to get the house vacated. Later, the bailiff was to come back on December 18th but the Islamabad Police refused to provide force for the purpose.



On the court’s intervention, the bailiff was sent again and raided the house on January 21 2009, but at the time Senator Talha was fully prepared and according to Adil, son of Ms Bilqees, 15 to 20 armed gunmen were present there who practically pushed the police out of the house and threatened Adil with death if he dared to visit the house again. Adil has the photographs of the whole episode with Talha present at the scene and ordering his gunmen.



When Senator Talha was approached by this correspondent on his cell, he narrated a new story. He said he had entered a new rent-contract with Ms Bilqees and had paid her Rs1.8 million and that one son of Ms Bilqees was having a dispute with his mother and wanted to get the property. “Bilqees wants to rent out her home while her son does not,” Talha told The News.



When the same was conveyed to 72-year- old Ms Bilqees, she reached the offices of The News in 20 minutes with her 90-year-old husband and her two sons. The whole family stated on oath that they never had any dispute on property issue and that Senator Talha was making up such statements, which he had also done before the courts. These statements are completely untrue. Ms Bilqees said that she had not signed any new agreement with Senator Talha and had not received any money from Talha. “Rather, I am trying to get my house vacated under the court’s ruling and last raid of court’ bailiff was made on Jan 21st just two days back,” she reminded this correspondent.



When Talha was called again and was told about Ms Bilqees and her family’s presence in The News office, he invited this correspondent at his home (H#13-A, Street-61, F-7/4) to see some fresh documents. When this scribe visited the house in question, even at that time more than 15 guards were present outside the gate of the house.



During the meeting, Talha introduced this scribe to a new man Syed Waheed Hussain Sabzwari and said: “In fact, after the IHC decision I have accepted the court’s ruling and was ready to vacate the house. But, one of my damages claim petition was pending before the court. I have claimed damages of Rs 6.5 million from Ms Bilqees, which include Rs 1.5m for development works in the house and Rs5m for the mental torture I faced during the whole episode.



“After the IHC verdict on December 3rd we (Ms Bilqees, Senator Talha and Syed Waheed Hussain) have entered into a compromise pact according to which, I have withdrawn my damages claim of Rs 5 million and Ms Bilqees has agreed to pay my expenses of Rs 1,533,575. Ms Bilqees has rented out her home to Syed Waheed Shah for five years on a rent of Rs. 30,000 per month. Total amount of rent for five years (Rs.1,800,000 was paid in advance by Syed Waheed Shah in a way that he (Waheed) paid me (Talha) Rs1,533,575 and the rest Rs 266,425 was paid to Ms Bilqees.”



Talha provided The News with three documents; a compromise statement between three parties, a lease agreement between Ms Bilqees and Syed Waheed Hussain, and a copy of check of account of Syed Waheed Hussain issued in the name of Ms Bilqees Israr amounting to Rs 266,425/-. Talha said that he no more had possession of the house for the last one and an half months as Ms Bilqees had entered into a contract with Syed Waheed Hussain, though while making this statement Talha was sitting in the same house with whole of his office staff. Syed Waheed is the owner of Web Com, a cable network, which operates in Islamabad.



On returning to the office, when Ms Bilqees was asked about her agreement with Syed Waheed Hussain, she denied even seeing or meeting any person with that name in her whole life. At this when the agreement was shown to her, she was shocked as even her signatures were there which she claimed were faked. She said that she never entered into any compromise agreement with any third party on December 3 as mentioned in the documents given and was regularly visiting the courts throughout the month of December, 2008 and January, 2009 in her bid to vacate her house and under which courts’ bailiffs were formed on December 18th and January 21st.



She said she had offers of rent of Rs 150,000 per month for the house, how can she go for any compromise after winning the case and on a rent of rupees 30,000 per month. “I have lost all hopes after fighting this long battle and facing such questions but do I look mad to you that I will rent out my house situated in F-7 Sector of Islamabad for merely Rs 30,000 when I have offers of Rs150,000 per month for the same house.” On the question of Rs1,533,575/- development work done by Talha in her house, she disclosed that Talha had provided her with bills of different things purchased for the house which include furniture, computers and air conditioners and some of these bills were bearing the date which was even before of our first-ever rent agreement.



When The News contacted three different property dealers operating in the area, it was known that the market rate of rent for a house like in question (580 yards, a little more than one Kanal with three bedrooms in a two-storey house) in Sector F-7, vary from Rs120,000/- to 150,000/ at least.



The other document provided by Talha was a cheque from Syed Waheed Hussain in the name of Talha amounting Rs1,533,575 bearing date of December 1, while the compromise agreement was reached on December 3, 2008. During her meeting with The News on Friday, January 23, Ms Bilqees denied receiving any amount of Rs 266,425 from Syed Waheed. She, however, contacted The News on Saturday and said that on contacting her bank she came to know that a deposit of Rs266,425 had been made in her account on December 19. She said that her account number was available with Senator Talha, and the amount was transferred in her account without her knowledge.



She said she had moved an application in the bank to reverse the amount in the account of the person who deposited it in her account without her permission with the aim of occupying her house. Ms Bilqees provided The News a letter of the HSBC Bank saying that the bank shall revert the amount in the account of person who deposited it without the will of the account holder as soon as possible.



The climax of the story came when Syed Waheed visited The News office on Saturday. On being questioned about the fake compromise agreement and the new rent agreement documents, he conceded that if the rent was less he and Senator Talha were ready to raise the rent. He said that he was even ready to purchase the house if Ms Bilqees wanted to sell it. Waheed admitted that he was in great tension because of the situation and asked this scribe to mediate between the parties to get him out of the issue. He said that when he invested for the house he was not in picture of the complication and the background situation of the issue. It appeared that the poor guy was worried that he had paid Rs1.5 million to the Senator and Rs266,425 to the lady and the amount may be lost.



Senior Civil Judge Islamabad issued the latest orders on January 23 to concerned Kohsar Police Station SHO to get the house vacated. However, when Ashraf Shah, SHO Kohsar Police Station Islamabad, was contacted to know that why he was not taking action for vacation of the house said he was not responsible for vacation of house. His duty is to provide force to the bailiff and the whole responsibility lies with bailiff.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/315144-murder-suicide-turns-out-to-be-honour-killing,,Murder-suicide turns out to be ‘honour’ killing,"The investigation into the case of the Quran teacher who allegedly murdered her teenage student and committed suicide earlier this week in Nazimabad has revealed that the student’s family killed both women in the name of ‘honour’ and tried to portray their deaths as a murder-suicide.

The bodies of 24-year-old Nasreen, the Quran teacher, and her 18-year-old student Rabia were found on May 7 from a house in Kausar Niazi Colony, North Nazimabad.

Quoting Rabia’s family’s statement to the police, District Central SSP Dr Rizwan Ahmed Khan had back then told The News that Nasreen wanted Rabia to get married to her brother and when she refused the proposal, the teacher killed her and committed suicide.

However, on late Wednesday night, in light of the investigation’s findings, Haidery police registered an FIR under Section 302, 311, 201, 202 and 34, of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Section 7 of Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) against both the families of Rabia and Nasreen.

The FIR was registered on the findings of Haidery police station’s Duty Officer (DO) Muhammad Ameer, who initially investigated the case, and submitted his report raising suspicion on the families of the deceased women.

In his report submitted on May 9, Ali stated that the bodies of the two women were taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for post-mortem examination and later handed over to their heirs for burial.

He added that he tried to get the families to register an FIR of the incident but they insisted that they would do so once they had buried the deceased.

Ali’s investigation revealed that Rabia’s family had forced her into an engagement against her will in Hyderabad and had called her Quran teacher over to convince her that she should marry the man they had chosen. According to Ali, both families issued contradictory statements to the police.

He again tried to get to them to lodge an FIR but the families held an unlawful jirga and decided to not file a case against each other, he added.

On the basis of his findings, Ali concluded that both women were shot dead by Rabia’s family in the name of ‘honour’ and recommended, in his report, that a murder case be registered.

He observed that the incident had created a sense of fear and terror in the community and therefore a section of the ATA should also be included in the FIR.

Speaking to The News about the investigation on Thursday, District Central SSP Khan said that Rabia was in love with Nasreen’s brother and wanted to marry him, but her family forced

the engagement with another man on her.

According to Khan, Rabia’s family called Nasreen to their house to make her agree to the marriage, and later, shot both of them dead. He said Rabia’s family killed them at 4:30pm and called the police at 6:30pm claiming that Nasreen had killed Rabia for refusing to marry her brother and then pointed the gun at herself.

SSP Khan said a 30 bore pistol and four casings were also recovered from crime scene which police has sent to the forensic division for examination.",['Our Correspondent'],"The investigation into the case of the Quran teacher who allegedly murdered her teenage student and committed suicide earlier this week in Nazimabad has revealed that the student’s family killed both women in the name of ‘honour’ and tried to portray their deaths as a murder-suicide.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/685247-protesters-slam-cases-detention-mir-shakil-ur-rahman-paying-price-for-free-journalism,,"Protesters slam cases, detention: Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman paying price for free journalism","KARACHI/LAHORE/RAWALPINDI/PESHAWAR: The countrywide protest by the workers of Geo-Jang Group along with journalist organizations and political workers continued against the unjustified and illegal arrest of Editor-in-Chief Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman for the last 119 days and condemned the widening conspiracy to involve members of his family in the fake and fabricated case, terming it shameful. They said the independent press has always been the bete noire of inept leaders and their governments who have nothing to deliver to the people and this is true in the case of Mir Shakil who has become a target of the rulers' wrath.

The protesters chanted slogans and carried placards against the unjustified and illegal arrest of Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman and demanded his immediate release. While addressing the protesters at the protest camp in front of Jang Building Rawalpindi, Secretary General PFUJ Nasir Zaidi, Chairman Joint Action Committee of workers of Geo and Jang Nasir Chisti, Chairman Editorial Committee Jang Rawalpindi Hanif Khalid, Chief Reporter Jang Rawalpindi Rana Ghulam Qadir, PML-N leader of Rawalpindi Imtiaz Taji and other workers of Jang and The News condemned the conspiracy of involving the family of Editor-in-Chief in the fake and fabricated case. They termed it a large pattern of harrassment and victimisation against the group and the Rahman family. They pledged that the workers will foil all the conspiracies against the group, the Editor-in-Chief and his family and demanded his immediate release and withdrawal of cases.

In Karachi, Pakistan People’s Party leader Waqar Mehdi told Imran Khan that he was not the prime minister of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf but of the entire country and he should act accordingly. Mehdi condemned Rahman’s detention and called it an attack on the freedom of press. He said that the PPP stood by with the Jang-Geo Group and demanded immediate release of Mir Shakil and withdrawal of cases. He said the Jang-Geo Group and Rahman are paying the price for not letting the government strong arm their editorial policies and said the writing on the wall cannot no more be hidden. Mehdi said instead of uniting the country, Khan was bent on compounding the peoples’ problems with rising inflation and unemployment. He said the NAB and other institutions should refrain from becoming party to Imran’s personal vendetta against Mir Shakil.

In Lahore, the media workers including senior journalists continued their protest on the Davis Road against the illegal detention of Mir Shakil and demanded his immediate release. Those who spoke on the occasion included senior journalists Maqsood Butt, Shahab Ansari, Zaheer Anjum, Asif Bajwa, Awais Qarni, veteran journalist Azhar Munir and Muhammad Farooq Awan while Shafiq Ahmed, Khalid Khattak, Shahid Aziz and many others were also present on the occasion. Maqsood Butt said Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman was under detention for four months under a fabricated reference which does not even fall under the NAB jurisdiction. He said Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman was a symbol of resistance and was fighting for the freedom of press in the country. He said the Editor-in-Chief was not just the owner of media house but is the torch-bearer of media freedom. He further said Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman did not do the government bidding of stopping critical news reports and firing news anchors and reporters as demanded by the government and is being subjected to witch-hunt. He urged the Chief Justice of Pakistan to take suo motu notice on the baseless case against him. He said in every democratic society, the media acts as a watchdog but in our case dissent is not being tolerated. Here the democracy has been replaced by tyranny, he said. Shahab Ansari said no society could progress without justice and expressed the hope superior courts will provide justice to Mir Shakil. Veteran journalist Azhar Munir recited some poetic masterpieces to highlight the increasing curbs on media freedom in Pakistan.

Similarly in Peshawar, the media workers of the Jang-Geo Group continued their protest against the unlawful arrest of group’s Editor-in-Chief. Carrying banners and placards inscribed with slogans demanding to remove curbs against free media and Rahman’s release, they demanded the immediate release of Mir Shakil and withdrawal of cases against him. The participants deplored that the Lahore High Court had rejected the bail application of Mir Shakil. They quoted constitutional experts who have said the National Accountability Bureau has no justification to detain a citizen in a private, property case but on the contrary Mir Shakil is under arrest for the last 119 days. He said since they have failed to break MSR, they are now planning to unleash further harassment and victimisation by involving the entire Rahman family in the fabricated case. They appealed to the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan to take notice of the ongoing injustices with the editor-in-chief of the largest media group of the country. The speakers included senior journalists Arshad Aziz Malik, Shakeel Farman Ali, Shah Zaman, Imdad Ali Qazalbash and others observed that the prolonged detention of Mir Shakil had created unrest and disappointment among the workers.

They said the rulers were living in a fool’s paradise if they thought they could suppress the voice of the independent media through coercive tactics. The speakers resolved to continue performing their duty to expose corruption, lack of governance and bad policies that have unleashed multiple crises for the people of Pakistan. They said they had rendered sacrifices in the past too and would do so in the future as well. The speakers pledged to continue the protest till the acceptance of their demands.",[],"The protesters chanted slogans and carried placards against the unjustified and illegal arrest of Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman and demanded his immediate release.

SHEIKHUPURA: Several men allegedly gang raped a woman as her husband was held hostage in Kala Shah Kaku, a town in Sheikhupura district police said Friday.

According to DPO Sheikhupura Salahuddin, the couple had arrived in Lahore from Rawalpindi on September 16 in search of jobs. After running out of money, the husband and wife were sitting outside the Minar-e-Pakistan when a conman tricked them into coming with him to his village.

The couple said that the suspect lured them with the promise to find them jobs and a place to stay. However, when they reached Kala Shah Kaku, they were held hostage and four to five men, according to the woman, gang raped her in her husband's presence.

Police said that a case had been registered and an investigation was underway while six suspects have been arrested in connection with the crime.

The woman's medical test has been conducted and her DNA samples have been collected by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, said the Sheikhupura DPO.

A week earlier, Pakistanis from all walks of life took to the streets demanding immediate and stern action against those involved in the Lahore-Sialkot motorway gang-rape.

Two suspects had allegedly robbed and gang-raped a woman in front of her children on September 9 in an area falling within Gujjarpura police station's jurisdiction.

The expulsion will be applicable to her after she will be released from Quebec prison.

Tooba Yahya, her husband Mohammad Shafia and son Hamed were found guilty of murdering four women and were sentenced to 25 years of prison without any parole in 2012.

The murdered Zainab, 19, Sahar, 17, Geeti, 13, were daughters of Tooba Yahya while Rona Amir Mohammad, 52, was the first childless wife of Mohammad Yahya in a polygamous marriage. Their bodies were found in a car that was submerged in a canal in Kingston, Ontario.

The women were murdered because they refused to abide by the family rules. Notions put up in the court in defense said that honour, directly tied to women’s sexuality and general control of their behavior, was put at stake and they were killed in order to cleanse the family of the shame that they had brought.

Speculations suggest that Yahya, Shafia and Hamed drowned the four victims or led them to unconsciousness or death, placed their dead bodies in the car and pushed it into the canal with the help of another vehicle.

However, it couldn’t be proved where or how the pre-drowning occurred.

RAWALPINDI: A 13-year old girl was martyred and her two family members were injured in yet another ceasefire violation by the Indian troops on the Line of Control (LoC), the ISPR said on Sunday.

The Indian troops initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation in Hajipir and Bedori sectors along the LoC on Saturday night, targeting civil population.

Due to indiscriminate fire of Indian troops in Mensar village, Bedori Sector, a 13-year old innocent girl, Iqra Shabbir, embraced martyrdom, while her mother and a 12 year old boy sustained serious injuries.

The Pakistan Army troops responded effectively to Indian unprovoked firing.

After the fresh ceasefire violation, Pakistan on Sunday summoned Indian Charge’d Affaires Gaurav Ahluwalia to register a strong protest. Director General (South Asia and Saarc) Zahid Hafeez Chaudhry summoned the Indian diplomat and condemned the targeting of innocent civilians by the Indian forces, said the Foreign Office.

This year, India has committed 1,440 ceasefire violations, martyring 13 people and leaving 104 other innocent civilians seriously injured.

Condemning the targeting of innocent civilians by the Indian occupation forces, the DG (SA and Saarc) underscored that such senseless acts, in clear violation of the 2003 Ceasefire Understanding and complete disregard for international human rights and international norms, further vitiated the tense atmosphere.

He added that by raising tensions along the LoC and the WB, India could not divert attention from the worsening human rights situation in the Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IOJ&K). He said the Indian government must realise that its irresponsible policies and unilateral actions were increasingly affecting peace and security in the region.

“India must act responsibly in the interest of regional peace and security,” he added.

The DG (SA and Saarc) called upon the Indian side to respect the 2003 Ceasefire Understanding; investigate this and other such incidents of deliberate ceasefire violations and maintain peace along the LoC and the WB. He also urged that Indian side should permit the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) to play its mandated role as per the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions.",['Our Correspondent'],"Ag APPRAWALPINDI: A 13-year old girl was martyred and her two family members were injured in yet another ceasefire violation by the Indian troops on the Line of Control (LoC), the ISPR said on Sunday.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/756235-orange-the-world,,Orange the world,"Violence against women is rampant not only in Pakistan but around the world in various forms, be it domestic violence and abuse, sexual abuse and harassment, forced marriage, child marriage, human trafficking, cyber-bullying, acid attacks, female genital mutilation, etc. In fact, women face physical, psychological, and sexual violence in every sphere of life, whether they are at the workplace or on the street or in the market.

The ‘In-Depth Study on All Forms of Violence against Women: Report of the Secretary-General, 2006’, mandated by General Assembly resolution 58/185, states that “Violence against women is one of the most pervasive human rights violations. It devastates lives, fractures communities, and stalls development. At least one out of every three women around the world has been beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime – with the abuser usually someone known to her.”

It is a sad fact that gender-based violence whether in the home or the community is rooted in the global culture of gender inequality and discrimination, which not only violates the fundamental human rights of women and girls but also allows violence to occur with impunity. It is used as a tool to keep them under control.

Acceptance of violence as a social norm is also responsible for increasing incidents of violence against women. It is said that men who grow up seeing violence being perpetrated accept it as the norm and often resort to violence. But women now are not ready to accept it and are beginning to speak up. A scene in a Pakistani drama Kankar, aired some years back attempted to explain this possible root cause of marital abuse, where the young wife who is physically abused by her husband openly tells her mother-in-law that it is her fault as she silently accepted violence at the hands of her husband.

However, we need to understand that violence against women is not inevitable, but preventable. To end this cycle of violence, it is essential to change the attitudes that perpetuate, rationalise, and normalise violence, and deny women their right to safe living. Since men are overwhelmingly the perpetrators of gender-based violence, their attitude needs to be changed.

It is heartening to know that the world has not accepted the situation and a lot is being done to raise awareness about violence against women and to mobilise efforts to end such practices. Women’s rights organisations have been, for long, raising their voices against women’s rights abuses. Though countries are taking measures to prevent such crimes, it is a global problem and requires global action.

And action is indeed being taken. On the one hand, there are legislations and UN conventions that call for action to curb violence against women, and on the other, there are awareness campaigns such as 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence that seeks to inspire action to end all forms of violence against women. The Campaign was launched in 1991 by the Centre for Women’s Global Leadership (CWGL) at its first Women’s Global Leadership Institute in 1991 and is used as an organising strategy by individuals and organisations around the world to call for the prevention and elimination of gender-based violence (GBV).

The campaign runs between Nov 25 and Dec 10 every year; the dates chosen are significant as the starting day is the International Day of Elimination of Violence Against Women, and the concluding day is the International Human Rights Day. The dates symbolically link violence against women and human rights and emphasises that such violence is a violation of human rights.

Campaigns such as this one highlight the issue, and create public awareness about the need to bring about changes to prevent it from happening at the local, national, regional, and global levels.

While Pakistan has made some progress in the right direction as several women-friendly laws have been passed by parliament that deal with various forms of gender-based violence including honour killing, rape, sexual harassment, acid attacks, forced marriage, etc a lot more needs to be done as the laws are not properly implemented and women are still subjected to discrimination and violence. The lower status of women in our society is also contributing to gender-based violence.

In light of the increasing cases of sexual abuse in the country, and public demand for legislation, the Cabinet Committee on Disposal of Legislative Cases has approved two anti-rape ordinances aimed at setting up special courts for sexual offences against women and children and introducing harsher punishments for convicts. According to reports, the two ordinances – the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Ordinance, 2020 and the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 – provide mechanisms in the investigation and punishment of rape and sexual abuse against women and children. After final approval from the cabinet, they will be sent to the president to be promulgated and must be submitted to parliament for ratification within 90 days after being promulgated.

We have hope that something is being done to curb crimes of the worst nature against women and children. At the same time, care should be taken that the legislation does not remain on paper but is implemented in letter and spirit. At the same time, tighter implementation of other pro-women bills is the need of the hour to enable women the space they deserve in society. However, for results to show, awareness and a change in attitude is essential.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/167478-Couple-murdered-in-name-of-honour,,Couple murdered in name of honour,"PESHAWAR: A man allegedly killed his daughter and her alleged paramour in the city on Thursday.

An official of the Tehkal Police Station said that Khan Afzal, a resident of Jehangirabad locality, allegedly killed his 23 years old daughter, Yasmeen, and her lover Junaid, 22, at his house. The official said the police arrested Khan Afzal along with a gun from his house and started investigating the incident. As per the police preliminary report, Yasmeen was already married to another person.

The report said the father of the young woman found her and her alleged lover at his house and killed both of them on the spot. Honour killings continue to happen in the province. On May 19, a man allegedly killed his 16 year old daughter Nosheen and her alleged lover Shakil in a suspected case of honour killing in Dir Colony in the jurisdiction of Yakatoot Police Station in the city.

As per the recently adopted new law in October, if a woman is murdered in the name of honour by a close family member the culprits will be liable to strict punishment even if they are pardoned by other members of the family.

Noor Alam Khan, a Supreme Court lawyer who deals with the honour killing-related cases, told The News the anti-honour killing law, in principle, directs judges to sentence someone accused of an honour-killing to a life-term in prison, whether the victim’s immediate family forgives the culprit or not. However, legal experts are of the opinion that after killing a relative in the name of honour, a person may declare it a simple murder to avoid the punishment.

Under the existing law, a murderer can be released after the legal heirs pardon him. The proposed legislation on honour killings recommends 25 years’ imprisonment even if the heirs of the victim pardon the convict.

Under Section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), the convict in a simple murder case may get the life imprisonment of 14 years or a maximum of the death penalty. Noor Alam Khan said the legislation on honour killings would not achieve the desired results as the accused may claim that he had committed the murder for other reasons such as a dispute over property, etc.

“Hence, he may be charged with Section 302 of the PPC and the family members may pardon him under Section 309 of the PPC,” the lawyer added. According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, 1,276 incidents of honour killings were reported in the country from February 2014 to February 2016 but the first information reports were registered in 400 cases only.",['Akhtar Amin'],"The official said the police arrested Khan Afzal along with a gun from his house and started investigating the incident.

Talking to this scribe before stepping in court, he said, “I am seriously thinking to develop a forum against women violence and killing in the name of honor. Soon I will announce a detailed charter against violence in consultation of close aides. There is a dire need to protect women from all types of violence.”

Earlier, District and Session Judge Multan Ameer Ahamed Khan granted bail of cleric Mufti Abdul Qavi, the co-accused in social media celebrity Qandil Baloch murder case and ordered to submit Rs 200,000-surety bond on Tuesday, court sources said.

Mufti Abdul Qavi’s counsel Syed Khurram Shahzad told The News the cleric would be released from district jail court time on Tuesday.

It is worth mentioning that the D&SJ announced his first verdict after shifting of all the lower courts at newly established Judicial Complex while district bar association observed strike against shifting of lower judiciary at new Judicial Complex on Tuesday.

The counsel argued that police could produce mobile sets of Mufti Abdul Qavi on remand papers. He said that Mufti Abdul Qavi handed over those mobile sets voluntarily to police to check calls data instead police recovered from cleric during investigation.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/728367-prime-suspect-in-lahore-motorway-gang-rape-case-abid-ali-arrested,,Prime suspect in Lahore Motorway gang-rape case Abid Malhi arrested in major breakthrough,"The prime suspect in the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway gang-rape case, Abid Malhi, was arrested on Monday after a period of over one month, Geo News reported.



Police said that Abid is being brought to Lahore from Faisalabad where his DNA test will be taken.

The other suspect who allegedly raped the woman, Shafqat, is in jail on judicial remand. The Intelligence Bureau (IB), Special Branch of the police and other agencies had done a recce of the suspect and tipped off Punjab Police about the whereabouts of Malhi.

Malhi's DNA test had been obtained thrice from the motorway rape victim's samples. However, once more his DNA test will be taken and matched with the samples before any formal proceedings begin against him.

Key points about motorway rape suspect Abid Malhi's arrest:

- Suspect falls into trap laid out by Punjab police

- Police used Malhi's wife to lure him to Faisalabad

- His DNA test will be taken and matched with samples of the victim

- After the DNA tests, formal proceedings against Malhi will be initiated

- Punjab Police intentionally ""cooled things down"", says Fayyaz Chohan

- Malhi got to know about police raids from media reports: Chohan

The motorway rape case's prime suspect had managed to evade arrest four times by escaping the clutches of the Punjab police.

How did police manage to catch the motorway rape suspect?

Sources told Geo News that a trap had been laid out for the motorway rape prime suspect, falling into which he was apprehended by police. Sources informed Geo News that Malhi's wife was given a SIM which she used to call him.

Malhi told his wife in one of his calls to her that he would meet her in Faisalabad. When the motorway rape suspect arrived in the city to meet her, he was nabbed by police officials in plain clothes.

According to Geo News correspondent Ahmad Faraz, Malhi was arrested without any torture or scuffle. He was apprehended easily and taken from Faisalabad to Lahore.

Punjab govt to do everything in its power to make 'example out of him'

Speaking to Geo News, Punjab information minister Fayyaz Chohan said that the provincial government would do everything in its power to make an example out of the motorway rape suspect.

Talking about how the Punjab government aims to prosecute Malhi as he had managed to be secure a bail previously despite rape charges, he said:

Chohan said that without speaking to the motorway rape victim, the Punjab government had managed to identify the suspects within 72 hours.

""No shortcomings will take place from [the government's side],"" Chohan said of the case.

He said that Malhi had managed to escape the clutches of the police due to detailed media hype and reporting about him.

""Due to the media's hype regarding the case, he escaped police raids four to five times as he used to get information from his sources about the police,"" said the information minister.

Chohan said that the Punjab police had ""intentionally cooled down things"" over the things and observed that Malhi had also relaxed over the past 10-12 days which ultimately led him to become less careful.

The minister said that to hide details of the investigation from the public at large, he used to ""play down questions asked to me"" about the motorway gang-rape case during press conferences.

The information minister stressed that if the prosecution, police, and the judicial system play their role in the right manner, then such people would not escape the law again.

Prime suspect in motorway rape case raped woman and her daughter in 2013

According to reports, Shafqat and Abid were at the Lahore-Sialkot motorway on Sept 9 with an intention to rob any motorist when they saw a stationary white-coloured car on the roadside. The two approached the vehicle, threatened and robbed its occupants, and then gang-raped the woman in front of her children after dragging them to a nearby field.

Police had earlier disclosed that apart from Shafqat's statement, his DNA had to match as well, which is why the samples had been sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA). The arrest was made with use of footprint-tracking as well as DNA samples.

The PFSA had Abid's prior DNA records from 2013, when he had raped a woman and her daughter and was booked alongside four others under Sections 376 and 395. While he had been bailed out at the time, his DNA and fingerprint records were saved in the lab's data bank.

The lab's system identified him as the same rapist from more than seven years ago.

PEMRA directs to stop coverage of motorway rape case

On October 2, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) had barred all satellite TV channels from covering the motorway rape case.

A notification from the regulatory authority had stated that the airing of content related to the investigation of the case will diminish the ""evidentiary worth of the material collected by the prosecution"".

PEMRA stated in its notification that since the offence is related to a sex crime, hence media coverage concerning the victim and her family will also be a cause of discomfort and disgrace for her.

The authority told news channels to refrain from airing any content with regard to the case on electronic, print, and social media, in the future, and warned that in case of non-compliance, strict legal action will be taken as per PEMRA's ordinance.

What is the motorway rape case about?

Malhi has been on the run since September 9, when it was reported that two robbers had allegedly gang-raped a mother of three on the Lahore-Sialkot motorway in an area falling within Gujjarpura police's jurisdiction.

The woman, along with her children, was driving to Gujranwala when she was forced to stop at the Gujjarpura section of the motorway after running out of fuel, at around 1:30am.

She immediately called a relative and sent him her location. He asked her to also dial the Motorway Police helpline 130 from which she reportedly received no response.

In the meantime, two robbers reportedly approached the car, broke the window, and took the woman and her children to nearby bushes where they allegedly raped her in front of the children.

They also allegedly snatched her purse carrying Rs100,000 in cash, one bracelet, car registration papers, and three ATM cards.",[],"The prime suspect in the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway gang-rape case, Abid Malhi, was arrested on Monday after a period of over one month, Geo News reported.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/155353-Parliament-adopts-bills-for-prevention-of-rape-honour-killing,,"Parliament adopts bills for prevention of rape, honour killing","ISLAMABAD: Parliament on Thursday approved bills aimed at the prevention of honour-killings in the country, removing a loophole allowing killers to walk free after being pardoned by family members.

A joint sitting of Parliament also passed a bill boosting the punishments for some rape offences, mandating DNA testing and making the rape of a minor or the disabled punishable by life imprisonment or death.

The bills were moved by Law Minister Zahid Hamid and Senator Farhatullah Babar which were duly approved by the parliamentarians, in the joint session held today.

The amendments passed Thursday and published on the National Assembly website mandate judges to sentence someone who kills in the name of ""honour"" to life imprisonment, even if they have been forgiven, said senior opposition lawmaker Farhatullah Babar.

""Even if the close family members pardon the murderer, the court is bound to send him to jail for 25 years,"" Babar said.

It said the identity of the victim must be kept secret and verdict be announced within 90 days.

The bill for the prevention of honour killings stated an honour killing convict would at least be handed life in prison.

In case of pardon by the heirs of an honor killing victim, the minimum punishment - life in prison - will remain in place and could not be reduced.

Law Minister Zahid Hamid, on the occasion, said the government will end the menace of honor killings from the country. He said a detailed consultation was held with parliamentarians from all the parties and a consensus was developed.

There have been numerous incidents of rapes and honour killings in Pakistan in the past, in most of which the victims were either forced to silence or in case of killings for 'honour' the accused was pardoned by other heirs of the victim.

""Laws are supposed to guide better behaviour, not allow destructive behaviour to continue with impunity,"" said former senator Sughra Imam, who initially put forward the bill.

Some 500 women are killed each year in Pakistan at the hands of family members over perceived damage to ""honour"" that can involve eloping, fraternising with men or any other infraction against conservative values relating to women.

""These bills are hugely important for Pakistani women, where rape conviction rates were almost non-existent, due in large part to various technical obstacles to accessing justice,"" said Yasmeen Hassan, Global Executive Director at Equality Now.

""We hope that these new laws will help generate a cultural shift in Pakistani society and that women will be able to live their lives in safety,"" Hassan said.

Earlier this year, a Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was also allegedly murdered by her brother in one such incident of honour killing.

Her killing left many in shock and drew severe criticism of the authorities.

Qandeel's killing followed another murder of a British-Pakistani wife, Samia Shahid, in Jhelum – again for the sake of 'honour'.

The gruesome killing of the British-Pakistani woman renewed the calls for effective legislation to curb this practice.",[],"ISLAMABAD: Parliament on Thursday approved bills aimed at the prevention of honour-killings in the country, removing a loophole allowing killers to walk free after being pardoned by family members.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/237816-PIMS-strike-allegedly-takes-a-life,,PIMS strike allegedly takes a life,"Islamabad: While the token strike for separation of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) from the Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University (SZABMU) continued for the 16th consecutive day, the alleged negligence of doctors took the life of 27 year-old Umar Aftab who, family sources claim, was denied medical treatment because of the ongoing strike.

Umar, a resident of Shakrial, was brought to PIMS at around 11.30 a.m. on Monday for treatment of a massive blood clot, and even though the three-hour token strike had ended at 11 a.m., the boy was denied treatment on the pretext of doctors being on strike. The clot is stated to have caused a cardiac arrest.

Family sources alleged that one Dr. Naila refused to check Umer on account of withdrawal of services due to the strike, and referred them to Dr. Rizwan. “When I asked her to write the doctor’s full name of a piece of paper, she retorted: ‘I am not a kid; I will not do as you ask,’ family sources told the media.

Dejected, the family took their son back home, only to return to the hospital once again at 3 a.m. due to his deteriorating condition. “Not a single doctor was available to examine our only son. Two compounders examined him and declared him dead,” the family alleged. Umar had, by then, lost the battle.

Meanwhile, responding to the incident, the Minister for Capital Administration and Development Division (CADD) Dr. Tariq Faal Chaudhry urged the media not to link Umar’s death with negligence. “Not a single day during the strike has the emergency of PIMS remained closed. In fact, the strike has been scaled down to a three-hour token protest only.”

Dr. Tariq added: “If the death has actually occurred because of doctors’ negligence, then investigations will be held and strict disciplinary action will be taken against those held accountable. “An inquiry committee has been constituted with Dr. Iqbal Memon, Dr. Ejaz Qadeer, Dr. Rizwan Qazi and Dr. Naeem Malik as its members. The committee has been asked to investigate into the cause of death and to submit its findings within the next 24 hours,” the Vice Chancellor of SZABMU Prof. Dr. Javed Akram informed. However, the way matters are handled at PIMS, even a layman can predict the findings of the committee.

Earlier on, Dr. Tariq said in fury: “Right from Day 1, I have been saying that doctors are following the wrong path. Instead of withdrawing patient services, they should lock down my office instead as a mark of protest.”

Expressing his views on the separation of PIMS from SZABMU, Dr. Tariq said, “We will only segregate the administrations of the two institutions so that the civil servant rights of PIMS employees are restored. The medical university and PIMS will continue to work together and function as before. Those attached with SZABMU will not suffer in any way.”

Meanwhile, the All Employees’ Movement for Restoration of PIMS will unveil its future plans today (Wednesday) on expiry of the week-long deadline given to the government for resolution of the PIMS-SZABMU crisis.",[],"Meanwhile, responding to the incident, the Minister for Capital Administration and Development Division (CADD) Dr. Tariq Faal Chaudhry urged the media not to link Umar’s death with negligence.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/752698-rule-of-law-as-blackmail,,Rule of law as ‘blackmail’,"Literature on the justice system in Pakistan states that litigants often use delay as a strategy in their court cases to impose costs on the opposing parties.

Basically, rule of law is used as a tool to ‘blackmail’ opponents. This happens in cases in front of the lower judiciary; and also takes place in national politics as we saw in the alleged IG kidnapping case in Sindh a few weeks ago in an episode euphemistically known as the ‘Karachi incident’.

Rule of law has become so dysfunctional that it is used as a blackmailing tool from the lower to the higher levels of socio-political arenas. How to fix this broken system? Osama Siddique wrote an exhaustive report on ‘Caseflow Management in Courts in Punjab’, with outstanding analysis of primary data in 2016 as part of the European Union’s Punjab Access to Justice Project and we are going to refer to it today in this article.

The basic concept of ‘caseflow management’ is that the court system needs an administrative and management arm that directs and monitors the dispensation of justice on the basis of data review. Court proceedings are haphazardly managed in the present system, driven by contending parties and their lawyers and inconsistently monitored by members of inspection teams of high courts. In the present system, the judge does not control the court proceedings effectively; and other stakeholders find plenty of opportunities for delay.

According to Siddique, “Caseflow Management involves (but is not limited to) the entire set of actions that a court takes to monitor and supervise the progress of cases, from initiation to conclusion, including organisation and management of daily dockets, setting calendars and time standards, establishing case processing tracks, management of individual cases, management of the court’s overall pending caseload, vision-setting and strategic planning, budgeting and resource utilisation, and overall judicial policymaking, goal-setting and leadership.”

There is a need to move away from the textual emphasis to a process-driven review of the system. Modern caseflow management concepts are largely missing from the court system in Punjab (and also the rest of Pakistan). While there are some statutory guidelines by the high court in terms of rules, orders, and directions to give timelines for stage-wise progression of cases, they are not adequate. Certain stages of a case, such as serving the summons, still take an inordinately long time.

The National Judicial Policy (NJP) also sets overall timelines for the civil and criminal cases’ completion. However, in these guidelines the ‘age’ of the case seems to be the main criterion – and the burden of responsibility is on ‘individual’ judges rather than the institution as a whole. It creates “perverse incentives” because to meet the case disposal targets, the judges make progress on less complex cases as more complex cases take more time and are not differentiated in the prevalent guidelines.

Adjournments are rife in court cases and stay applications elongate the court proceedings. However, they are not dealt with the prevalent management of the court system. Lawyers also play a crucial role in delaying the proceedings of the cases to increase their earnings; they also resist and block any judicial reform efforts. Yet, little effort has been made to neutralize this negative role of the bar.

The report’s primary data collection was done in three districts of Multan, Muzaffargarh, and Bahawalpur in Punjab. One of the strong findings is that only 25 percent of civil cases and 12 percent of criminal cases were decided on ‘merits’ and availed the full legal recourse. Other cases were disposed of in earlier stages as a result of them being withdrawn or as a result of compromise etc. The pre-trial scrutiny of cases is really weak. Unlike modern caseflow management principles, where there is adequate pre-trial scrutiny of cases to avoid frivolous litigation, both pre and post trial scrutiny are terribly weak over here. Systematic data collection and analysis is almost non-existent and court records are in a shambolic state. Criminal cases have very weak investigation and prosecution.

As practised in countries with a functional justice system, there is a need to impose costs and penalize the delay. That is not done; hence, delay is used as a strategy to deny justice by the contending parties and their lawyers.

There is no single, dynamic, coordinated and integrated caseflow management document that ties all the ends for the smooth flow of court procedures. Rather, the prevalent guidelines are thinly “spread across the Civil Code, the Criminal Code, other applicable procedural laws, the Lahore High Court (LHC) Rules and Orders, relevant judgements of the Supreme Court and the high courts, and administrative directions, notifications and instructions of the LHC of very different vintage.”

There is also a need to re-examine and update the outdated current rules and aspects of court supervision and replace them with the adoption of rule-based unified systems with new rules to fill the existing gaps. New filing formats also need to be introduced where the bulk of required information can be provided. The written evidence should also be accepted. Right now, so much time is wasted on gathering oral evidence. Similarly, technology and audio-visual tools should be used to expedite the proceedings.

The judicial policy should establish ‘judicial control’ over the deliberations of court proceedings. There should also be institutionalization of a ‘case screening approach’. There is also a need for a framework for ‘stage-wise times’ for categories of different cases. Continuous management and monitoring of cases is required.

As a follow-up of the report, the Lahore High Court has deliberated amendments to civil and criminal procedures in the last two years. However, they are not implemented yet. It also remains to be seen how much the new rules are diluted from the recommendations of the report.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/632081-fia-arrests-man-allegedly-involved-in-harassing-girl-online,,FIA arrests man allegedly involved in harassing girl online,"The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Friday claimed to have arrested a man in Karachi allegedly involved in digital harassment.

According to the FIA’s Cybercrime Circle director, Waqar Chauhan, an enquiry No. 136/2020 was registered in the FIA Cybercrime Circle, Karachi, on the complaint of a woman on behalf of her 14-year-old daughter against unknown persons.

The suspects were accused of threatening and harassing the girl and her cousin via WhatsApp messages. The woman said the suspects were sending obscene material of her daughter via WhatsApp and demanding extortion money. The suspects were said to have forced the victim “to fulfil their ulterior motives and illicit desires” in their threatening messages.

Following the complaint, a raid was conducted in Karachi’s PECHS area by a team headed by Inspector Saalim Rind. In the raid, an alleged person, namely Musaib Umar, was apprehended and his mobile phone was technically analysed which revealed that the obscene images of the victim were present in his mobile phone as well as his alleged IDs were also found active therein. Also, the suspect was found to impersonate himself as a girl on Instagram and sharing the obscene pictures of the minor girl in order to trap other girls. The FIA said the suspect was found involved in transmission of the obscene material of the victim to her family and others on Instagram, using an Instagram ID.

The FIA said the suspect had committed the offence punishable under Sections 21/21/24 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 read with 419/420 of the Pakistan Penal Code.

In a similar case this month, the FIA claimed to have arrested five suspects for allegedly threatening and harassing two women in Karachi. The suspects, namely Zeeshan Shareef, Abdul Nawab, Umair Nawab, Muhammad Zain and Muhammad Rizwan, were apprehended during a series of raids conducted by the FIA’s Cybercrime Circle in different areas of Karachi.

According to the FIA spokesperson, an enquiry was registered in the FIA Karachi on the complaint of one of the women against unknown persons. The complainant said the suspects were threatening and harassing her and her cousin via WhatsApp messages which contained their obscene images. She said the suspects wanted them “to fulfil their ulterior motives and illicit desires”.

The spokesperson said the mobile phones of the arrested suspects were technically analysed after which it came out that obscene images of both the victims were present in their mobile phones. The spokesperson said all suspects were found involved in transmission of the obscene material of the victims to each other as well as to the victims, using their own SIMs and WhatsApp numbers.",['Faraz Khan'],"The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Friday claimed to have arrested a man in Karachi allegedly involved in digital harassment.

This was stated by Provincial Minister for Human Rights and Minority Affairs Ijaz Alam Augustine during a policy dialogue arranged by an NGO in collaboration with Pakistan Girl Guides Association, National Commission for Human Rights and Australian High Commission in Pakistan in connection with the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence Campaign. The minister said the government would ensure inclusiveness in all policy matters to reflect the voices of marginalised groups in the decision-making process.

The girls on the occasion appreciated the Punjab government for legislation and establishment institutions to deal with the issue of violence against women. Rashida Qureshi, the programme coordinator for the NGO, said the 16 Days of Activism against Gender Based Violence Campaign was an international campaign that took place each year from November 25, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, to 10 December, World Human Rights Day.

Iftikhar Mubarik, executive director of the NGO, highlighted the importance of equipping the young girls with appropriate information and skills particularly focusing on legal framework of Pakistan to address the deep-rooted issue of gender-based violence. Hina, a 16-year old girl, highlighted the issue of discrimination between boys and girls in terms of minimum legal age for marriage for girls and boys as it was 18 for boys and 16 years for girls. It must be a concern for all key stakeholders keeping in view the lack of maturity in any person under 18 would not be awarded national identity card, driving licence or even would not be offered an ordinary formal employment.

Sonia, a rights activist, stressed the need for including online safety as important component of curriculum keeping in view immerging issues like cyber harassment of women.

Mr. Brek Betley, deputy high commissioner of Australia in Pakistan, urged upon inclusion of all stakeholders, including parents, teachers, religious leaders, local government representatives, media, civil society, parliamentarians and ministers to address the issue of violence against women and girls. A group of parliamentarians comprising Mrs Zakia Shahnawaz of PML-N, Mrs Musarrat Jamshed Cheema, PTI, Mrs Sadia Sohail Rana, PTI, Mrs Neelum Hayat, PTI and Mrs Sumaira Ahmed Bukhari, PTI, assured their full support in raising the issues faced by girls. They said that they would raise the issue of minimum legal age for marriage and make efforts to make public spaces safe and accessible to all without any discrimination on gender basis, incorporation of online safety in school, college and university curricula. The representatives from Punjab Commission on the Status of Women, Chief Minister’s Strategic Reform Unit, National Commission for Human Rights and other government departments also endorsed the demands made by the girls to end all forms of gender based violence.",['Our Correspondent'],"Lahore: The Punjab government is following a zero-tolerance policy about violence against women and girls.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/274166-dr-sahar-ansari-found-guilty-of-sexually-harassing-fellow-ku-professor,,Dr Sahar Ansari found guilty of sexually harassing fellow KU professor,"A three-member committee at the University of Karachi has found Professor Sahar Ansari, a visiting faculty member and famous literary personality, guilty of sexually harassing a female assistant professor at the varsity’s Pakistan Study Centre and stopping just short of suggesting his removal, has recommended that he be kept away from varsity activities.

The alleged harassment incidents occurred roughly two years ago and have been investigated by two committees since then. In April 2016, Dr Navin G Haider had filed a complaint to the then vice chancellor Dr Muhammad Qaiser against the visiting professor. To investigate the complaint, a committee headed by Dr Rahila Anjum was ultimately formed, which in May 2016 gave a clean chit to the accused professor.

However, Dr Navin approached the Provincial Ombudsman for the Protection of Women against Harassment at the Workplace Justice (Retd) Shahnawaz Tariq and on August 21, 2017, he rejected the KU committee’s inquiry report and directed the KU vice chancellor to form a new one to investigate Dr Navin’s complaint against Ansari under the Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010.

On the ombudsman’s directive, KU formed a committee comprising Centre of Excellence for Women’s Studies Chairperson Professor Nasreen Aslam Shah, KU Deputy Registrar Ashraf Ali and Karachi University Teachers Society President Prof Dr Jamil Hassan Kazmi.

Subsequently, on November 24, 2017, Navin submitted a written complaint to the new committee stating that the harassment incidents started when Ansari shook her hand using the pretext of Friendship Day sometime in February 2016.

According to Navin, it was a one-off incident, a way for Ansari to lure her into a handshake in “an isolated environment” and “the handshake was made to initiate an uninvited and uncalled for conversation.” She added that Ansari deliberately held her hand beyond the duration of a normal handshake, and as a result of that incident, she felt uncomfortable in his presence and began avoiding him.

Navin’s statement further added that on March 14, 2016 she was walking towards the office of the then head of Pakistan Study Centre and Ansari was on his way out. She saw him as she was passing through the PA’s room which is situated next to the entrance of the director’s office. Navin said that she moved to the side to give Ansari space to pass, but instead of walking to the door he turned towards her and came nearer.

“[He] held my shoulders and pushed me back against the PA table. He began talking to me and said “Aap hichkicha kiun rahi hain” [why are you hesitant],” Navin wrote. She further said that she was horrified at Ansari’s behaviour and yelled at him loudly, saying “What are you doing? Are you mad? Do you have no shame?”

She added that she pushed him back and ran out of the room into the corridor and was in such a frenzy that she went back to her room and stayed there till she calmed down. Following the incident she went to the centre’s director Muhammad Jaffar Ahmed and told him what had happened, but no action was taken against Ansari so she submitted a written complaint to the then VC, Navin wrote.

The probe body examined her statement and issued a notice to Ansari under the anti-harassment law to submit his written response.

In his response submitted on December 13, Ansari rejected the allegations and stated that he had extended his hand to Navin for a handshake, which he claimed was usually how they greeted each other, but on that day she refrained from shaking his hand which he found to be a “strange attitude from her.”

He claimed that Navin was using the anti-harassment law for her own benefit and was making up a false story in which she has been changing statements.

According to Ansari, she told the then director Jaffar Ahmed that he moved towards her; then she told the former VC Dr Muhammad Qaiser that he lunged at her; then she said that he [Ansari] held both her shoulders and attempted to lay her on the PA’s table.

“The aim of her story is to create agitation among students, boycott classes and launch a social media campaign against me and Muhammad Jaffar,” he wrote to the committee. He added that Navin had told the earlier inquiry committee that she was bothered by that fact that Jaffar was retiring as the centre’s director and his wife Dr Anwar Shaheen would replace him, which would affect her negatively.

“I am 76 years old and I have had an open heart surgery. Because of arthritis, I walk like a cripple and can fall down if I don’t have support,” Ansari wrote in his defence, adding that a healthy woman such as Navin could’ve easily pushed him away. Further trying to cast doubt on the veracity of the incident, Ansari questioned why Navin did not resist or shout loudly for help. “If she had done so, Muhammad Jaffar would have come out of his office and Ms Navin would have had an eyewitness,” he claimed.

In-person appearances

On December 14, 2017, the committee members reviewed both Dr Navin’s written complaint and Dr Ansari’s response and directed both of them to appear in-person before the inquiry committee.

Navin appeared on December 19 to record her statement. She repeated all the details from the March 14 incident in the PA’s room. She also said Ansari visited Jaffar’s office often and used to look into her office as well. According to her, a friend named Samina was usually sitting with her in the room and Ansari would also try to strike up a conversation with her too and say that he had seen her somewhere before.

Navin further said that one day when she was alone, he came into her room and said it was Friendship Day and he had dropped by to wish her. She added that since he was senior she stood up in respect and when he extended his hand for a handshake she extended hers too out of courtesy, but he kept holding her hand for a long time and she had to pull it away from his grip. According to Navin, after the handshake incident she began avoiding him.

The following day on December 20, Ansari appeared before the committee to record his statement. He said that he had known Navin for the past eight years and he usually exchanged pleasantries with her when he passed by her room. He claimed that sometimes when she invited him for tea he would go in and she would shake his hand.

He added that he was leaving Jaffar’s room and she was entering it so as per their routine, he extended his hand, but she didn’t take it. Ansari said that he asked what was wrong but upon getting no response from her he left and then Jaffar later called him and said she had complained that he had harassed her.

In his statement to the committee, he also lashed out at artist and activist Sheema Kermani saying that she had told the ombudsman that he [Ansari] had tried to come close to her and had touched her. He showed a photo of him and Sheema on his phone saying she had wanted to take that photo at an international conference last year.

“Who is nearer to whom in the photo, the committee’s members can easily decide,” he said, according to a copy of the appearance’s transcript available with The News.

“I have shown you photos of the champion for women rights. It was not mutual, she was coming close to me [in the photo] and if someone is coming close to me I have no objection. People even hug me and love me. You are not aware that I am not an illiterate person. People feel proud to take photos with me,” he said to the committee.

According to the meeting’s transcript, when he was told that he was getting personal, Ansari said the committee members were asking “illogical” questions. When he was questioned about his tone, he said that a truthful person would speak just like him and added that he had the option to go to court as well.

Other witnesses

The inquiry committee also visited Pakistan Study Centre and questioned employees and students there and also asked for their written statements.

Computer operator Faizan informed the committee that some three years ago, he had seen Ansari walking with a bunch of students and he had seen the professor run his hand over the back of a female student who was talking to him.

Assistant librarian Tahir Butt said that two female students had complained to him separately. One who was visiting from another department had complained that he had been looking at her and singing songs, while the other had said that the professor had touched her inappropriately.

Student Aeysha told the inquiry committee that Ansari had taken her number and called her between 9pm and 11pm, had also offered to take her for lunch and offered her a pick and drop facility. Another student Samina said that when he met her he claimed he had seen her somewhere and asked for her number. She added she gave him the wrong phone number.

Recommendations

In its report, the committee concluded that Navin had indeed complained to the relevant authorities – first to the centre’s director verbally and then a written complaint to the VC.

It added Ansari had admitted in his statement that handshaking and hugging was normal for him and he wouldn’t mind if someone wants to stand close to him or hug him, therefore, he likely considered his behaviour with Navin a usual matter of routine, but she construed it as harassment.

It also observed that Navin appeared before the probe body with witnesses but Ansari refused to appear with witnesses and also said that he didn’t care what the committee would decide.

In its report, the committee noted that any civilised society, especially a prestigious educational institute like KU, would not allow anyone to utilise their fame to harass students or staff.

The report further states that a large number of female students were enrolled at the university and such incidents of harassment are not addressed on time, parents may be inclined to not send their daughters for education there.

In light of witnesses and statements, the inquiry committee has reached the decision that Navin’s statement was true while Ansari repeatedly said that hugging and handshaking are not objectionable actions, the report added.

Stating that it is important for the KU administration to maintain its respectable status and take steps to prevent such acts from happening in the future, the committee recommended that Ansari should be barred from being part of academic and literary activities at KU.",['Arshad Yousafzai'],"In April 2016, Dr Navin G Haider had filed a complaint to the then vice chancellor Dr Muhammad Qaiser against the visiting professor.

The recently held Emmy Awards stood out for appreciating diversity on various levels. While people of colour, including Riz Ahmed (The Night Of), picked up trophies, female centric TV series such as Big Little Lies and The Handmaid’s Tale won multiple awards and remained the highlight of the night. Not just that but other television series that centre upon a range of themes were also honoured with at least one trophy (Atlanta, The Night Of, Veep) each.

If we look at American television, it has a place for all sorts of subjects, from domestic violence (Big Little Lies) to politics (Veep) to science fiction (Westworld) to reality-suspense thriller (The Night Of) and much more. But if we analyze drama serials that are dominating our TV screens for the last couple of years, life appears to be stuck in relationships. There is lack of diversity not only in terms of content but characters as well. Local television has no place for crime stories or medical dramas or action thrillers but relies heavily, rather obsesses with domestic violence, women as victims, relationships and saas-bahu disputes. They are fixated with love tales, marriage and extramarital affairs, instilling the belief that there is nothing more to a woman’s life than dealing with the men in it. The progression, though little, that we see around has no place in these dramas that only endorse victimization of women and the fact that they are dependent on their male counterparts.

While that may be true to a large extent given that we live in a patriarchal society, there are women around who are leading an independent yet content life. Married, unmarried or single moms, a lot of them do have a career to focus on and take care of the family at the same time. There is much more to their lives than getting into a relationship or cry over their fate for not being able to find the perfect man for themselves. But what we see on our television is the exact opposite. Even top rated TV plays follow the same trend and when producers try to experiment with unusual plots, most of them fail on the rating card.

A period drama called Mor Mahal, directed by Sarmad Khoosat just last year, created a lot of hype initially but didn’t manage to make a mark despite an all-star ensemble cast including Meesha Shafi, Umair Jaswal and Hina Bayat; Mor Mahal had strong headed women at its core. Noman Ijaz-starrer ongoing political drama, Khan that aimed to break away from clichéd plotlines, has also lost track after the first few episodes and is no more than a never-ending tale of revenge.

A recent trend that has been observed on television is attaching a social cause to the production. While Udaari that focused on the issue of child sexual abuse was a huge success, none of the social dramas after this achieved the same impact. Ayesha Khan-starrer Khuda Mera Bhi Hai that followed the story of a transgender lacked the sensitivity and depth required to deal with the subject with some technical flaws here and there.

This year’s much anticipated drama, Sammi that starred Mawra Hocane in a lead role, wasn’t substantial either. With vani (forced marriage) as its central theme, the production didn’t create any awareness on the subject and seemed to have lost the purpose towards the end.

While we appreciate that some brave productions think out of the box, tap into different genres and experiment with new ideas, it is unfortunate that these projects fail to make a mark. Either they aren’t executed well or the plot weakens somewhere in the middle. New drama serial Rangreza that features Sajal Aly and Noman Ijaz offered a refreshing experience as it introduced a character as progressive as Sassi (played by Sajal) while highlighting male hypocrisy at the same time. Though it was fast paced and intriguing in the beginning, the story hasn’t moved forward for the last couple of episodes.

On the other hand, Saba Qamar’s Baaghi that is inspired from the life of Qandeel Baloch is still going strong after nine episodes. Though that also takes into account women-centric issues, it has a progressive approach with small yet powerful messages to deliver. Aside from this, Yakeen Ka Safar that features Ahad Raza Mir and Sajal Aly as doctors, has a medical angle to it and is more realistic than any other TV serial on air these days. It views people as professionals while tapping into their personal lives as well, making it more relatable.

Though these TV plays break away from hackneyed plots and characters, they are very few and often go unnoticed. It is time more and more producers and/or channels tried their hand at unique subject matter without worrying about numbers. There are a number of TV plays that are currently on air on multiple channels these days. If one script out of every 10 projects isn’t governed by numbers but substance, with a particular focus on content, it can change the entire perspective on television that has been under severe criticism for promoting regression.",[],"Local television has no place for crime stories or medical dramas or action thrillers but relies heavily, rather obsesses with domestic violence, women as victims, relationships and saas-bahu disputes.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/603485-the-state-of-police,,The state of police in Pakistan: Reformed or deformed?,"Graphic by Naseem Ur Rehman

Police is undoubtedly the face of the state. Ideally it should safeguard the rights of the people and protect their lives, property and honour. It has to ensure also that the laws of the land are implemented and violators, however strong and connected, are apprehended and relief provided to those wronged by them.

The presence of police is supposed to bring comfort and security to citizens. Unfortunately, the situation is otherwise in Pakistan. People prefer to keep a safe distance from them and the very thought of visiting a police station gives them goosebumps.



Why is this so? The answer given by policy makers and experts on policing is that the police force in Pakistan is still working on the model formed by the British under the Police Act of 1861, and that it has not changed much from an opposite force to a service-oriented entity. This Act was promulgated four years after the triggering of the War of Independence in 1857 or the ‘mutiny’ as the British would call it. The purpose of that police was to crush a population ruled by a colonial power so that they never again think about raising their heads. The police continue to carry forward the legacy of that era and the efforts made to reform it according to the needs of the current times have not yielded fruit.

Against this background, the agenda to reform police and make it people-friendly, accountable, independent, free from political influence, efficient, courteous and humane becomes highly relevant. Recent incidents like the killing of an innocent family in a police action in Sahiwal, and the murder of a mentally challenged man, Salahuddin, in police custody, have evoked severe criticism and led to demands to streamline the affairs of this department.

This is not the first time that such demands have surfaced. So far, 24 commissions have been formed in the country to introduce police reforms but the fate of the recent ones has not been much different from the earliest. The stated aims purpose of introducing these reforms over the years have been to introduce operational responsibility, freedom from political interference in their operational/functional decision making process in areas such as recruitments, postings and transfers, promotions and investigations, internal and external accountability, financial independence and responsibility, performance-based monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, gender-sensitive approach, induction of more women in police, measures to improve the image of the police, efforts for trust-building between the police and the masses etc. What hampered progress in this context is the question?

A serving senior police officer, who is privy to recent developments on police reforms, points out that there is a lack of political will to introduce them and at the same time there is a strong resistance from the Police Department. “Nobody wants to leave their comfort zone and forgo the powers they are enjoying.” The officer says that the Police Order 2002 introduced by General Musharraf was a good effort as it talked about operational autonomy, tenure security and external accountability mechanisms. But he says it was made toothless to a great extent through amendments made in 2004. “Even today politicians are being quoted saying as to what is the purpose of their contesting elections and winning if they cannot even get a Station House Officer (SHO) appointed or transferred.”

Under the Police Order 2002, he says, the transfers and postings of senior police officers in the province were the responsibility of the inspector general of police (IGP). But now the chief minister (CM) is performing this function. Similarly, the official adds, the politicians are not willing to lose control over police because this would go to their disadvantage and make them worthless in the ‘eyes of their voters’. He suggests the reforms agenda should be according to the socio-cultural, economic and political dynamics of the society and the system must have the absorptive capacity to embrace it – enforcing the model of a European country in one go will not help.

In this context, there is a general agreement among the proponents of police reforms nationwide that the Police Order 2002 is a good law. All four provinces and the ICT Police should be governed by the same law with minor changes as per local needs. The Police Act of 1861 (along with the Police Rules of 1934), a colonial legacy meant to suppress the people rather than serve them, was in force in Pakistan with minor modifications until 2002, before the promulgation of the Police Order 2002. The said law gives tenure protection to IGP of the province as well as the district police officers etc but these are being changed at will by the political elite without giving a show cause notice or assigning any reason.

Syed Safi Pirzada, senior manager and head of police trainings and reforms at Rozan – a civil society organisation working on and advocating police reforms, says the objective of this exercise shall be to have a police free from political influence but at the same time both internally and externally accountable for its deeds. Independence without accountability leads to inefficiency and abuse of power, he adds.

He says different provinces are working under different police laws modified over time but unfortunately, the Islamabad police is still working under the Police Act of 1861 introduced by the colonial masters. The public oversight structures like District Complaints Authority and Public Safety Commission provided for in the Police Order can be instrumental in prior identification and addressing cases of abuse of power by local police, he adds. Pirzada says this will also be helpful in establishing an independent judgment on any issue through empowerment of community members. He says police reforms are important because an efficient police gives citizens a feeling of security, serves as deterrence for wrongdoers, lays foundations of a society where justice prevails, helps build an environment where businesses flourish and investment arrives and so on.

Pirzada says there is no doubt police reforms are required at all levels but improving things at the level of police stations is imperative because these are the main points of contact between the public and the police. He says that a high profile committee comprising of serving and retired police officers and bureaucrats had compiled findings and given suggestions for police reforms in May 2016 on the directives of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

Some of the findings were that the average tenure of an IGP is less than 12 months, of a district police head is nearly 6 months and of an SHO is less than 3 months; 90 per cent of the force is undereducated; average shift for constables is 12 hours; due to lack of funds, the police station tends to engage in the collection of funds through other means and each police station needs an additional amount of Rs 0.7 million per month beyond what the budget provides it to cater for fuel, utilities, maintenance and investigation costs. This amount is currently generated ‘off-the-ground’ by the police stations illegally.

Some suggestions were that provinces should introduce Police Access Service (PAS) as established in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, establish District Complaint Authorities (DCA) in every district, impose a punishment of 5 year imprisonment over a false FIR, set the minimum tenure of SHO and police station staff to 2 years, reduce working hours for constables from 12 to a maximum of 8 hours, ensure premature transfers come with written justifications, guarantee presence of sufficient women police officers and a law graduate for legal guidance at every police station.",[],"Graphic by Naseem Ur RehmanPolice is undoubtedly the face of the state.

The Police Act of 1861 (along with the Police Rules of 1934), a colonial legacy meant to suppress the people rather than serve them, was in force in Pakistan with minor modifications until 2002, before the promulgation of the Police Order 2002.","['deformed', 'state', 'tenure', 'pakistan', 'reformed', 'district', 'order', 'station', 'law', '2002', 'reforms', 'working', 'political', 'officers']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/image_loader_magzine.gif', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/mail.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/print.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/tns/2020-12-06/s_753630_054710_tns.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/tns/2020-01-26/603485_110449_tns.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/tns/2020-12-06/s_753629_054332_tns.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/detail-whatsapp.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/uploads/tns/2020-01-26/603485_11659_TNS-16_tns.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/detail-facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/thenews.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/tns/2020-12-06/s_753631_054853_tns.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/search_top.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/detail-twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/drop-down.png'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/tns/2020-01-26/603485_110449_tns.jpg,1,FALSE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0', 'TITLE': 'The state of police in Pakistan: Reformed or deformed? | Special Report | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'So far 24 commissions have been formed to introduce police reforms in the country but the objective has not been achieved', 'keywords': 'state,police,pakistan,reformed,deformed', 'og': {'title': 'The state of police in Pakistan: Reformed or deformed? | Special Report | thenews.com.pk', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/tns/2020-01-26/603485_110449_tns.jpg', 'description': 'So far 24 commissions have been formed to introduce police reforms in the country but the objective has not been achieved', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/603485-the-state-of-police'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@TheNewsonSunday', 'creator': 'Shahzada Irfan Ahmed', 'title': 'The state of police in Pakistan: Reformed or deformed? | Special Report | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'So far 24 commissions have been formed to introduce police reforms in the country but the objective has not been achieved', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/tns/2020-01-26/603485_110449_tns.jpg'}})",[],news
https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/173924-US-commission-seeks-repeal-of-blasphemy-and-anti-Qadiani-laws,,US commission seeks repeal of blasphemy and anti-Qadiani laws,"ISLAMABAD: United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) in its Annual Report 2016 called upon US administration to press Pakistan for the repeal of the blasphemy law and the rescinding of anti-Qadiani provisions of law.

The report issued months back, interestingly had also pointed out the issue of “forced conversions” of below 18 girls in Pakistan. In a strange coincidence, the Sindh Assembly recently passed a controversial law barring even conversion by choice to anyone below the age of 18 years.

However, following serious objections raised by religious sections of the country for barring even those below 18 who want to convert to Islam by their free will, the PPP leadership has decided to amend the controversial parts of the said legislation.

The religious sections of the society pointed out that Islam does not permit forced conversion and that it could be treated as a crime. However, barring below 18 years old from by choice conversion is un-Islamic.

The USCIRF, which in another report had admitted to have worked for change in school textbook syllabus in Pakistan, in its Annual Report 2016 said, “Forced conversion of Christian and Hindu girls and young women into Islam and forced marriage remains a systemic problem.”

It added, “In October 2014, the Pakistan-based Aurat Foundation reported that around 1,000 girls, many under the age of 18, are forcibly converted to Islam each year, mostly through forced marriages or bonded labor. According to the report, public pressure on the police often leads to inadequate or biased investigations in these cases and the girls and their families face intimidation to say they converted willingly…..”

It added that in February 2016, Sindh province passed a law to allow the Hindu community to officially register their marriages. “The law is also retroactive, allowing previously married couples to register. Reportedly, the National Assembly is considering a bill that would pertain to all Hindu marriages throughout the country. Christian marriages are recognized through the Marriage Act of 1872.”

Regarding blasphemy law and while discussing constitutional provisions and relevant laws which declare Qadianis as “non-Muslims”, the report recommended to the US administration, “Call for the repeal of the blasphemy law and the rescinding of anti-Ahmadiyya provisions of law; until those steps can be accomplished, urge the Pakistani government to reform the blasphemy law by making blasphemy a bailable offense and/or by adding penalties for false accusations or enforcing such penalties found elsewhere in the penal code.”

The Report also recommended the US administration to designate Pakistan as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) state for “engaging in and tolerating systematic, ongoing, and egregious violation of religion or belief.

A country designated by US as CPC is considered guilty of particularly severe violations of religious freedom under the International Religious Freedom Act.

The report also recommend to the US administration: Press the Pakistani government to implement its Supreme Court’s decision to create a special police force to protect religious groups from violence and actively prosecute perpetrators, both individuals involved in mob attacks and members of militant groups; Recognize the unique governmental offices focusing on religious tolerance at the federal and provincial levels by including discussions on religious freedom in US-Pakistan dialogues or by creating a special track of bilateral engagement about government efforts to promote interfaith harmony; Work with international partners to raise religious freedom concerns with Pakistani officials in Islamabad and in multilateral settings, and to encourage the Pakistani government to invite the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief for a country visit; Encourage national textbook and curricula standards that actively promote tolerance towards members of all religions, both in government schools and the madrassa system overseen by the religious affairs ministry; Encourage the government of Pakistan to launch a public information campaign about the historic role played by religious minorities in the country, their contributions to Pakistani society, and their equal rights and protections; either in parallel or independently, use the tools of US public diplomacy to highlight similar themes; Urge the Pakistani government and provincial governments to review all cases of individuals charged with blasphemy in order to release those subjected to abusive charges, as is underway in Punjab, while still calling for the unconditional release and pardoning of all individuals sentenced to prison for blasphemy or for violating anti-Ahmadiyya laws; Work with federal and provincial parliamentarians to support the passage of marriage bills recognizing Hindu and Christian marriages; Ensure that a portion of US security assistance is used to help police implement an effective plan for dedicated protection for religious minority communities and their places of worship; and, provide USAID capacity-building funding to the provincial Ministries of Minority Affairs, and work with Pakistan’s government and minority religious communities to help them reach agreement on measures to ensure their rights and security in the country.",['Ansar Abbasi'],"ISLAMABAD: United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) in its Annual Report 2016 called upon US administration to press Pakistan for the repeal of the blasphemy law and the rescinding of anti-Qadiani provisions of law.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/713235-motorway-rape-incident-public-fury-at-lahore-ccpo-remarks,,Motorway rape incident: Public fury at Lahore CCPO remarks,"ISLAMABAD: Lahore Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Umar Shaikh, who has been tasked to probe the rape of a woman on the Motorway, has started his investigation by questioning the choices of the woman, saying she should have taken a different route – a less deserted one – and checked her petrol tank before embarking on her journey.

The CCPO noted that the affected family departed Defence area of Lahore after midnight and took the Motorway route instead of GT Road, that too without adequate fuel. “The woman called her brother instead of police and her brother telephoned the Motorway Police at 1:30am to send a police mobile,” the CCPO said while talking to a private news channel.

Shaikh maintained the victim should have checked the fuel in her car beforetravelling as there is no petrol station on the Motorway. “There are three villages within the five kilometre radius of the incident spot. The suspects broke the glass window of the victim’s car. Blood samples have been taken from the glass. Latest technology of rural and urban police is being used in the investigation,” he said.

The statement of the CCPO drew sharp criticism from various circles, particularly from opposition leaders, and demand for his resignation #RemoveCCPOLahore has become top trend on Twitter.

Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shahbaz Sharif vowed to stand with the family ""till justice is served"". Condemning the incident, he said that the assault of a woman travelling with her children on the motorway is highly reprehensible, shameful and regrettable.

“This is a matter of national embarrassment and evidence of a completely broken down legal system,” the PM-N president said. He urged the government to investigate the case using quality investigative techniques like the ones used in the Zainab case so that the culprit is not let off the hook at the time of prosecution.

Shahbaz asked whose ""incompetence"" can be blamed for the motorway — which was always considered safe to travel — to have become a threat to safety. ""Law enforcement agencies must work together to apprehend those responsible and serve justice to the affected family so that the public's confidence in the government can be restored in some small measure,"" he said.

The PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb said the motorway incident was devastating as it is. “And to add to this, the CCPO's remarks are a moment of utter shame, disgrace and horror that someone who holds such views is responsible for the safety, security and dignity of our lives and property.”

Parliamentary Leader of the PPP in the Senate Sherry Rehman has submitted a call attention notice in the Senate Secretariat on the motorway rape incident. In her calling notice, she termed it as a heinous crime and the concerned ministry should reply before the Senate on it.

Sherry Rehman, while through his tweet, stated that she was shocked, frankly furious to hear some police officials have had the nerve to ask why the lady was out at that hour. “Too much as instead of doing their job of protecting citizens they are asking why women are driving or waiting for help on the motorway. They need to be dismissed,” she tweeted.

Adviser to the Prime Minister on Accountability, Shahzad Akbar admitted the government's ""administrative failure"" in the Lahore Motorway rape case, vowing that culprits would be arrested at all costs.

""There is some administrative failure [in the case] that we must admit since it took place on the link road that connects the two motorways,"" Akbar told a news conference. ""I see an unneeded controversy was created out of the CCPO's earlier statement,"" said Akbar. ""I have spoken to him about it, he will tell you himself what he meant by it.""

The prime minister's aide said that it was the government's responsibility to ensure that roads, motorways, streets and highways were safe for men and women to travel. ""If a case such as this takes place, it is also the government's job to arrest the culprits and make an example out of them,"" he said.

He also urged the media to keep the identity of the victim a secret even if they find out about it. The PPP Secretary Information Dr Nafisa Shah demanded the resignation of Minister of Communication Murad Saeed and Chief Minister Punjab Usman Buzdar over the incident of gang rape of woman on Lahore motorway. “The communication minister and chief minister should resign while accepting their incompetence,” she said.

Nafisa said it was tragic incident and all those involved in heinous crime should be brought before the law of land. Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari criticised the CCPO for blaming the victim.

“For an officer to effectively blame a woman for being gang raped by saying she should have taken the GT Road or question as to why she went out in the night with her children in unacceptable,” said Mazari in a tweet. “Nothing can ever rationalise the crime of rape.”

Minister for Planning, Development, Reforms, and Special Initiatives Asad Umar said that providing safety to the masses was the state's responsibility. Talking about the CCPO's statement, he said that he did not agree with the statement the police officer made. He said the statement was irresponsible and unnecessary, though there was nothing illegal in it. ""What action should we take against the CCPO? That he did not make a good statement?"" he asked, over calls for the CCPO's removal.

Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan expressed anger over the statement of the CCPO Lahore and asked him to leave his job if he cannot protect the citizens. In a video statement, Ali Muhammad Khan said the CCPO must be ashamed of his statement regarding the rape case. He said the CCPO is a highly responsible position and he cannot be allowed to pass such irresponsible remarks. He said it is the responsibility of state to protect its citizens no matter what time they choose to come out of their houses. He said the CCPO must step down if he cannot perform his duty.",['News Report'],"The PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb said the motorway incident was devastating as it is.

It is an honor for Pakistan that the eco-villa is developed with the efforts of Pakistani engineers, Pakistani labourers in association with British engineer within 3 months in Masdar City that is planned project in Abu Dhabi and it also hosts the headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

Executive Director of Eco-Villa Project Shahabuddin Shahab informed The News International that the eco-villa not only generates its own electricity but would be able to also export excess electricity to the national grid. Shahab said that Abu Dhabi government would introduce for the first time to pay back in cash to its customers who put excess electricity in Eco Villa through using less watts.

According to Masdar, the eco-villa is designed to consume 72 percent less energy as compared to existing villas in Abu Dhabi. The Eco-Villa Prototype is also designed to displace up to 63 metric tons of carbon emissions each year and use 35 percent less water than regular villas, Masdar claimed.

British Design Engineer Ross said to The News International that the ""Net Zero Energy"" villa will be equipped with 80 rooftop solar panels that can supply up to 40000 kilowatts per annum to the national grid, easily offsetting its own electricity requirements.

Replying to a question Shahab said that the cost of Eco-Villa construction is similar to that of a conventional home of the same size but he claimed that its energy and water efficiency would also reduce running costs substantially.

The grey-water that is gently used and is non-contaminated water from bathroom, sinks, showers, tubs, and washing machines would be supplied to the garden of Eco-Villa; said Shahabuddin Shahab. It is expected that the eco-villa will use 35 per cent less water than standard villas through innovative water conservation measures.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/240965-Men-still-killing-women-for-honour-in-Pakistan-despite-new-law,,"Men still killing women for ´honour´ in Pakistan, despite new law","ISLAMABAD: A year since new laws came into force aimed at stemming the flow of ""honour killings"", scores of young women in deeply conservative Pakistan are still being murdered by relatives for bringing shame on their family.

The shocking murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch by her brother last July turned the spotlight on an epidemic of so-called honour killings and sparked a fresh push to close loopholes allowing the killers to walk free.

Long-awaited legislation was finally passed three months later in a move cautiously hailed by women´s rights activists.

But, more than a year on, lawyers and activists say honour killings are still occurring at an alarming pace.

At least 280 such murders were recorded by the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan from October 2016 to June of this year -- a figure believed to be underestimated and incomplete.



Benazir Jatoi, a lawyer who works for the independent Aurat Foundation""There has been no change,"" Benazir Jatoi, a lawyer who works for the independent Aurat Foundation, a women´s rights watchdog, told AFP.

""In fact, the Peshawar High Court twice acquitted a man of honour crimes after this law was passed,"" she added.

The new legislation mandates life imprisonment for honour killings, but whether a murder can be defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge´s discretion.

That means the culprits can simply claim another motive and still be pardoned, said Dr Farzana Bari, a widely-respected activist and head of the Gender Studies Department at Islamabad´s Quaid-i-Azam University.

They can do so under Pakistan´s Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (retribution) law, which allows them to seek forgiveness from a victim´s relatives -- a particularly convenient means of escape in honour cases.

Bari called for a study on the murders of women over the past year to ascertain the scale of the problem.



File photo of Pakistani social media celebrity, Qandeel BalochThe convoluted courts system also often sees police encouraging parties to enter blood money compromises, circumventing the beleaguered judicial system altogether.

""Forgiveness and compromise negates justice,"" Jatoi said.

Asma Jahangir, one of Pakistan´s most acclaimed human rights lawyers, agreed, telling AFP: ""The law will be implemented once the courts function.""

´Of course, I strangled her´

The roots of ""honour"" killings lie in tribal social norms which remain prevalent across South Asia and dictate the behaviour of women in particular.

Women have been shot, stabbed, stoned, set alight and strangled for bringing ""shame"" on their families for everything from refusing marriage proposals to wedding the ""wrong"" man and helping friends elope.

Men can be victims too, but the violence is overwhelmingly aimed at women.

The double standard is glaring. Generally Pakistanis will accept a man who has committed rape, a senior police official who has overseen honour killing investigations told AFP.

But ""if a woman is even suspected of an affair it is considered a shame for the family and not forgiven,"" the official, who asked to remain anonymous as he was not authorised to speak to media, told AFP.

""People even sympathise (with) and praise the men who murder their women for so-called honour,"" he said.

Even when the state does take steps to implement the law -- as with the murder of Qandeel Baloch -- the wheels of justice often get stuck in the mud.



Wasim (R), brother of slain social media celebrity Qandeel Baloch and his cousin, who are accused of killing her, are escorted by policeman as they arrive at a local court in MultanBaloch achieved notoriety in Pakistan with her social media antics, tame by Western standards but considered provocative in a misogynistic country where women have fought for their rights for decades.

Her brother Waseem told reporters that ""of course"" he had strangled his sister, finding her behaviour ""intolerable"".

At first, Baloch´s heartbroken parents vowed they would give Waseem no absolution.

But well over a year later, the trial is still grinding its way through the courts.

This length of time is not unheard of for Pakistani murder cases, but it has been long enough -- as often happens -- for Baloch´s father to change his mind.

""I want my son to return home,"" Mohammad Azeem told AFP near the central city of Multan recently, dismissing Waseem´s proud statements. ""My son is innocent.""

Had international revulsion over the killing not seen the Pakistani state take the unprecedented step of declaring itself an heir alongside Baloch´s parents, their forgiveness could have already seen Waseem walk free.

Outdated, arbitrary, patriarchal code

For Jatoi, the issue goes far beyond the courts -- from the elites, where the political leadership fails to understand the issue, to the rural masses, where illiteracy and poverty help perpetuate it.

Rights activists have called for change for years, and Pakistan´s young, urbanised population often take to social media for campaigns such as last year´s #NoMoreKillingGirls.

But Jatoi said Pakistan as a society has been unable to move past the meaning of ""honour"".

""Only when we widely condemn the act will we stop seeing proud murderers... telling of how they killed a woman because she breached an outdated, arbitrary, and patriarchal ´honour´ code of which no one knows the rules.""",[],"ISLAMABAD: A year since new laws came into force aimed at stemming the flow of ""honour killings"", scores of young women in deeply conservative Pakistan are still being murdered by relatives for bringing shame on their family.

The woman waited for her husband and even phoned a relative. She called the Motorway Police's emergency helpline 130 for assistance. However, she was told by the operator that she could not be provided help as the emergency beat had not been assigned to anyone.

While she was stuck on the road, two unidentified persons arrived on foot from the nearby area surrounding the motorway and forced the woman and her children out of the car, cut through the fence around the motorway and allegedly raped her in the fields nearby.

Trocaire, Irish international organisation, with the support of the Australian Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade, last year launched a media advocacy campaign on the issues around gender based violence in Pakistan. The PurAzm campaign, titled ‘Gender equality – Our commitment’, is a call to youth, men and women to reaffirm their commitment to promote gender equality and challenge gender based violence.

The second phase of the PurAzm campaign envisions building on the work done thus far and identifying new partnerships to further effectively disseminate the message of “Gender Equality, Our Commitment.”

The second phase of campaign was launched with an inspiring “Balloon Raising Ceremony” which gave the participants an opportunity to sign “commitment cards” hanging at the ends of the balloons and reaffirm their commitment to gender equality and challenging gender based violence.

The balloons were released simultaneously in to the blue sky and symbolized the hopes and aspirations of the women of Pakistan and their quest for equality. The dramatic visual display of white balloons flowing freely in to the sky inspired the audience to make a renewed commitment to the cause of women and girls right.

“We celebrate the progressive legislative measures taken in Punjab and KP but we recognize the fact that violence against women and girls remains a serious and unacceptable reality in Pakistan,” said Country Director Trocaire in Pakistan John O’Brien.

PCSW Chairperson Fauzia Viqar said that alarmingly the number of cases of rape had increased in Punjab. Unfortunately, the rate of conviction is only three percent in rape cases, she added. The criminals get released because of complicated investigation process. Police officials destroy the proofs of rape victims intentionally, she said. It is disgraceful that bribe is demanded from victim family too in the police stations, she said. Moreover, she said, police officials are not trained to collect evidence from rape scene.

They don’t know how to collect DNA sample. Collection of evidence is a science and policemen are not aware of it, PCSW chairperson stated. She was of the view, “Lacunas are in our criminal judicial system which need to be addressed. Judges are over burdened.

There is no security for witnesses. Even eye witnesses decline to testify in court and subsequently, criminals got advantage of it.”

According to her, police don’t behave nicely with the victim. She said criminals got released as the victims could not pursue the cases because they could not pay the heavy fee of lawyers.

PCSW is statutory body established by by the government of Punjab for the promotion of women’s rights. As part of its mandate, PCSW gathers data related to violence against women from the office of the Inspectorate General Police, Punjab. It is pertinent to mention here that it does not directly address VAW.

According to Dr Tahira Rubab Hafeez, consultant clinical psychologist, the incidents of rape are attached with revenge in the country. It has been observed in most of the cases that rapists already knew the victim of rape. According to her, in masculine society, the rapists take pride in rape.

Additionally, in feudal society, family disputes invoke the rapists. The people don’t have healthy activities. That is why they are involved in such kind of criminal activity.",['Sher Ali Khalti'],"Lahore :Faisalabad, Lahore, Muzaffargarh and Rahimyar Khan remained on the top of the list showing the number of women raped in Punjab in the last three and a half years.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/720814-two-remanded-in-marwah-rape-murder-case,,"Two remanded in Marwah rape, murder case","Karachi : Police have discharged the suspect named Nawaz from the rape and murder case of five-year-old Marwah because no evidence was found against him during the investigation, the administrative judge of the anti-terrorism courts was informed on Saturday.

Accepting the investigating officer’s report, the judge sent the two main accused, namely Abdullah and Faiz, to jail on judicial remand and ordered that the charge sheet against them be submitted within two weeks. These suspects have admitted to committing the crime, according to the police.

Marwah had gone missing on September 4 after she left the house in the morning to buy sweets from a local shop in the Old Sabzi Mandi area. Two days later, her body was found stuffed in a bag at a dumping yard on the Milk Plant plot in the neighbourhood.

Inspector Qurban Abbasi, the IO of the case, said the police had collected the pieces of cloth with which the victim’s body was tied up. He said they talked to the local shopkeepers and street vendors, which led them to a tailor who identified the cloth and said he had given it to his employee Faiz.

During the suspect’s pre-screening, the police found that he was a habitual criminal and lived alone five or six houses away from the victim’s home in the same street. After he was detained, he disclosed the name of his accomplice Abdullah, who lived on a footpath in the area.

The IO said the suspect told the police that the two men had kidnapped Marwah, brought her to his house and then raped her one by one, during which she died.

After her death, they covered her with the pieces of cloth, put her in a garbage trolley and then dumped her at the above-mentioned plot, added the inspector. Following Faiz’s statement, Abdullah was detained and he also admitted to committing the crime.

The case was registered at the PIB Colony police station under the Pakistan Penal Code’s sections 364-A (kidnap of a person under 14), 302 (premeditated murder), 376 (rape), 201 (disappearing evidence or giving false information) and 34 (common intention), read with the Anti-Terrorism Act’s Section 7 (punishment).

A little over a week ago, police officials investigating the Marwah gang rape and murder case had made a shocking revelation that the five-year-old girl was not only raped to death but the sexual assault had continued even after the minor had succumbed to her horrific ordeal.

The investigators said that two of the arrested suspects had admitted to committing the heinous crime, saying that they had taken the girl to the roof of the house and there they had subjected her to rape.

“This is not a rape case but a gang rape case. The fingerprints of both suspects have also been matched,” said an officer privy to the matter, adding that samples were also taken from the girl’s clothes and the bed of the suspect Faiz, alias Faizu.

Police said Faizu and Abdullah are prime suspects among those arrested in connection with the Marwah rape and murder case. They said Faizu is a tailor and Abdullah is a garbage picker of Afghan origin.

Officials said the suspects live in the same area where Marwah’s house is located.

They said Abdullah had lived in the UK for seven years until he was deported.

The investigators said that there is strong evidence against both suspects. They said that while Faizu had kidnapped Marwah, both men had raped her, adding that the minor was sexually assaulted even after she had been raped to death.",['Our Correspondent'],"Karachi : Police have discharged the suspect named Nawaz from the rape and murder case of five-year-old Marwah because no evidence was found against him during the investigation, the administrative judge of the anti-terrorism courts was informed on Saturday.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/137226-Honour-killings-to-beFasad-Fil-Ardh-invite-25-year-jail-term,,"Honour killings to be ‘Fasad Fil Ardh’, invite 25-year jail term","ISLAMABAD: The proposed new law to check cases of honour killing in Pakistan will treat this crime as ‘Fasad Fil Ardh’ carrying a punishment of 25 years jail.

Unlike other sentences, the jail-term of 25 years to be given under the proposed law would not be allowed routine remissions as announced annually or on the occasion of Eid etc.

Official sources said that the draft law is being prepared in line with the provisions of the Constitution and Islamic teachings.

In a murder case under Islamic law, the murderer could be forgiven by the legal heirs of the deceased through a compromise either on payment of Diyat or even otherwise. However, if the murder falls in the category of ‘Fasad Fil Ardh’ then the killer can’t be forgiven by the heirs of the deceased.

In the case of honour killings, the Pakistan Penal Code will be amended to treat the crime as ‘Fasad Fil Ardh’. The amendment will authorise the court whether to accept or reject a compromise between the complainant and the killer who in most of the cases of honour killing has blood relations.

In many cases of honour killing, the killer commits this crime with the mutual understanding of the family. For example, the father or mother becomes a complainant in the case of his/her daughter’s murder by brother or any other close relative.

During the trial of such cases, the complainant (father/mother) usually forgives the killer (son/close relative) and thus the court has no option but to release the killer. With the proposed amendment, now the courts will have the final power of whether to accept or reject a compromise in such murder cases.

The government had earlier prepared draft amendments in certain laws to effectively check cases of honour killing and rape laws in Pakistan but those amendments could not be made because of lack of consensus among political parties. Now the proposed changes are being made in consultation with different political parties.

In regard to rape cases, the government wanted to introduce seven amendments in different laws to ensure that the rape victims get justice without any delay and exploitation.

The proposed amendments included the medical examination of the victim by a doctor within 24 hours to avoid any delay following any pressure or for any other reason. However, for the medical examination the consent of the victim will be mandatory. In case of the accused offender, reasonable force can be used for his medical examination.

Another amendment in the PPC was proposed to entail three years punishment for a doctor, police investigation officer and the prosecutor in case any of them is found involved (intentionally) in spoiling the medical, investigation or prosecution of the case in the court of law.

Another amendment being considered was to set a six- month period for the court to decide a rape case. It was also being proposed that the name of the victim could not be publicised without her or the court’s consent. The PPC was also recommended to be amended for the in-camera trial of the rape cases unless the victim decides otherwise.",['Ansar Abbasi'],"ISLAMABAD: The proposed new law to check cases of honour killing in Pakistan will treat this crime as ‘Fasad Fil Ardh’ carrying a punishment of 25 years jail.

Taking to Twitter, PM Imran said the ordinance will close all “loopholes”.

The premier said that he spoke to a police hero who played a key role in the recovery of Kashmore rape victim and lauded his bravery.

Kashmore tragedy

The premier lauded Sindh Police ASI Mohammad Bux Buriro and his daughter for their part in rescuing a four-year-old girl from men who tortured and gang-raped her.

""Spoke to ASI Buriro lauding his and his daughter's exemplary initiative and courage in the arrest of Kashmore rapist,"" he wrote in a tweet. ""The nation is proud of them and he has given positive uplift to the image of the police.""

The premier was referring to the sexual assault of a minor and her mother by three men in Kashmore.

A young woman from Karachi was duped by three men who took her to Kashmore with the promise of a job. They gang-raped her before selling her to Khairullah Bugti — a member of the gang — while the child remained with the other two.

Later, she was let go on the condition that she would lure another woman. However, she approached the Kashmore police who helped her recover the daughter.

Speaking to Zara Hut Kay hosts on Dawn TV, SSP Amjad Ahmed Khan said since the police department lacked female officers, ASI Buriro offered to use his daughter to set trap for the suspects..

Rape laws in Pakistan

There has been much debate around rape laws in Pakistan. The incident of Kasur's Zainab and more recently the motorway gang-rape in Lahore sparked a debate on the severity of punishment to prevent sexual assaults.

Speaking at a joint sitting of the Parliament after the passage of bills pertaining to the FATF, PM Imran had said that the government will soon introduce a three-tier legislation including registration of sex offenders, exemplary punishment for rape and child abuse and effective policing.

In an interview, PM Imran had suggested public hanging and chemical castrating the convicts to curb rising sexual violence in the country.",[],"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday announced that the federal government is bringing a ""stringent and holistic anti-rape ordinance"" next week.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/359469-cut-in-aid-amounts-to-cheap-blackmail,,‘Cut in aid amounts to cheap blackmail’,"RAMALLAH, Palestinian Territories: US President Donald Trump’s administration is resorting to “cheap blackmail” against the Palestinians with its decision to cut more than $200 million in aid for the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a senior Palestinian official said Saturday.

A State Department official said Friday that the decision, made “at the direction of the president,” came after a review of aid programmes to the Palestinian territories. The funding would “now address high-priority projects elsewhere”.

Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation’s (PLO) executive committee, hit back, saying: “The US administration is demonstrating the use of cheap blackmail as a political tool.

“The Palestinian people and leadership will not be intimidated and will not succumb to coercion. The rights of the Palestinian people are not for sale,” Ashrawi countered.

In January, the United States had already made drastic cuts to its contribution to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA.

Relations between the US administration and the Palestinian Authority took a nosedive after Trump last December decided to recognise the disputed city of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.

The Palestinians have suspended contacts with Washington and consider that it can no longer be an impartial mediator in the Middle East peace process.

After the latest blow, Ashrawi insisted that the Palestinians, living under Israeli occupation, would not be coerced into surrendering their rights.

“There is no glory in constantly bullying and punishing a people under occupation,” she wrote in a statement.

“The US administration has already demonstrated meanness of spirit in its collusion with the Israeli occupation and its theft of land and resources; now it is exercising economic meanness by punishing the Palestinian victims of this occupation.”

In an initial reaction on Friday, the PLO’s representative in Washington, Husam Zomlot, said the US administration was “dismantling decades of US vision and engagement in Palestine”.

“After Jerusalem and UNRWA, this is another confirmation of abandoning the two-state solution and fully embracing (Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin) Netanyahu’s anti-peace agenda,” he said.

The decision to cut Palestinian funding comes amid a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which has seen a surge of violence since Palestinian protests erupted in March.

At least 172 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, the vast majority of them during demonstrations near the border.",[],"RAMALLAH, Palestinian Territories: US President Donald Trump’s administration is resorting to “cheap blackmail” against the Palestinians with its decision to cut more than $200 million in aid for the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a senior Palestinian official said Saturday.

When the boy, a Class 12 student, was arrested on Wednesday, the police checked his mobile phone and found that he had watched the 'Crime Patrol' series over a 100 times.

According to reports, the boy killed his father Manoj Mishra, 42, on May 2 when the latter scolded him.

The boy hit his father on his head with an iron rod and when he fainted, he strangled him with a piece of cloth Later, the same night, the boy with the help of his mother, carried the body on his scooty to a forest area about five kilometres away and burnt it with petrol and a toilet cleaner to destroy the identity.

On May 3, police found the partially burnt body that remained unidentified for almost three weeks as no missing person report was filed in any police station.

The family, finally, lodged a missing person complaint on May 27 under pressure from ISKCON officials since Manoj Mishra worked there as a donation collector.

Some of his colleagues identified that the body was of Manoj from his spectacles. The victim's colleagues at ISKCON said that they did not doubt his prolonged absence since Manoj often used to travel to preach Bhagavad Gita. Mathura Superintendent of Police (city) Udai Shanker Singh said that whenever police called Manoj's son for questioning, he would evade coming and would instead ask the police under what provisions of the law they were trying to interrogate him.

However, when police checked his mobile phone, they found a history of the boy watching Crime Patrol episodes at least 100 times. Police said after several rounds of questioning, the boy finally broke down and admitted to his crime.",['News Report'],"MUMBAI: In a shocking incident, a 17-year-old killed his father in a fit of rage and took cues from TV serial 'Crime Patrol' to destroy the evidence, foreign media reported.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/666067-man-arrested-for-child-abuse,,Man arrested for child abuse,"LAHORE:Cantt Investigation police rounded up a pedophile who had abused a boy almost seven to eight times on different occasions in the limits of South Cantt police. On May 28, the accused identified as Bilal could not commit unnatural offence with the victim in his house as the boy’s father reached there while searching for his son.

Victim Feezan’s father Muhammad Arshad of Bhutto Chowk on Bedian Road, South Cantt, told that he found his son missing from the house in the morning at 7am on May 28. He started a search for his son and was attracted by hue and cry being raised by his son from the house of one Bilal living in the same locality. He entered the house and found his son lying naked in Bilal’s room. The accused escaped from the scene. The ill-fated father took his son home who later told that Bilal had already committed unnatural offence with him at least seven to eight times on different occasions.

The victim’s father lodged an FIR against Bilal on May 28, claiming that the accused was about to commit the sin with his son when he reached the spot and the accused fled from the scene. The FIR was registered under Section 377 P.P.C.

While talking to The News, DIG Investigation Lahore Dr Inam Waheed told that a special raiding team had been constituted to trace the culprit who was committing the sin secretly and would have continued to commit the crime if the boy’s father had not woken up earlier on the day of incident.

He said that the police team traced the culprit and others in the recent past by using an arsenal of high-tech systems and gadgets that were designed to enhance public safety, nab delinquents and save lives.

Dr Inam Waheed said that the police team arrested the accused, Bilal, from his house on May 29 and his sample would be submitted to forensic laboratory for DNA on Monday (today).

It is pertinent to mention that the Lahore Investigation Wing unearthed a racket in Nawab Town area some days back and arrested a pedophile who had abused two children and escaped arrest as the victims’ families pardoned him after threats.

One of the victims’ family migrated from Lahore in shame. The accused had to kill his third prey due to sudden arrival of someone in the under-construction plaza where he took the boy to abuse him. And the murder of the 10-year-old boy brought police to the doorstep of the accused within 48 hours, otherwise, he could still be a threat to innocent children.",['Salman Aslam'],"On May 28, the accused identified as Bilal could not commit unnatural offence with the victim in his house as the boy’s father reached there while searching for his son.

The accused had to kill his third prey due to sudden arrival of someone in the under-construction plaza where he took the boy to abuse him.","['house', 'team', 'child', 'arrested', 'man', 'bilal', 'investigation', 'abuse', 'accused', 'told', 'son', 'victims', 'lahore', 'father']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/700X390_thenews.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'Man arrested for child abuse | Lahore | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'LAHORE:Cantt Investigation police rounded up a pedophile who had abused a boy almost seven to eight times on different occasions in the limits of South Cantt police.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/466568-moot-asks-women-councillors-to-help-combat-gender-based-violence,,Moot asks women councillors to help combat gender-based violence,"Speakers at a women councillors’ convention on Wednesday exhorted the local government representatives elected on reserved seats for women to play their role in combating gender-based violence.

The Sindh Commission on the Status of Women, with the joint support of the Strengthening Participatory Organization, the Australian Government and the Australian Aid, organised the convention, bringing women councilors at district, taluka and union council level from various parts of the province.

The convention, which was held mainly to discuss the role of women local government representatives in combating gender-based violence in Sindh, was attended by a large number of women councillors from the province’s different parts.

Speakers, including civil and women rights activists, government officials, women parliamentarian and councillors spoke to various sessions. Themes of the sessions were ‘Redressal Mechanisms on GBV – developing links & coordination between departments and councilors’, ‘Gender-based violence – contributions of the civil society’, ‘The role of women councilors: past, present and future’ and ‘the role of political parties in strengthening women councilors.’

Speakers said that honour-related killings, domestic violence against women, forced marriages of minor girls and women in line with the local custom to settle blood feuds, early marriages, and kidnappings of women were common in the province, with many blaming them on the inefficiency of the government, law enforcement agencies and various segments of society.

“I believe we are in dire need to strengthen our bonds to make communication possible through networking,” said Nuzhat Shireen, the SCSW’s chairperson. “We need to break the wall of helplessness to create an environment which will help other women to approach councillors without any hesitation. We need to trust women instead of rebuking them, and that will only be possible if the councillors are well aware of the law and their responsibility towards its implementation.”

Sindh Women Development Minister Shehla Raza stressed the need for the creation of networks and said that a meeting would be held with the provincial police chief to sensitise the police force about dealing with violence against women.

She also apprised the women activists of various difficulties and ensured them their participation in politics. She said that women’s participation in politics was so difficult in the 1990s because of pressure from society. “When I was arrested for the first time in the 1990s as a student leader, many people were questioning my family about my political participation and studying in a co-education system in the university,” she said.

Tanzeela Qambrani, a parliamentarian from the PPP, said that councillorship was a key platform for women to start a journey in politics. Qambarani, who was a councillor in Matli municipality before becoming MPA, shared her experience of councillorship and said that in her first meeting, she was the only woman in the first meeting and relatives of other three women councillors were attending the meeting on their behalf.

She also said the Sindh Assembly had credited with passing the maximum number of pro-women laws, but unfortunately, they were poorly implemented mainly because of the women and people concerned were not aware about laws.

Malka Khan, an activist who has worked closely with women councillors, said that women were given 33 percent representation on local government bodies in 2001 and elected through direct voting. “But it is sad to say that now women’s seats in local governments have been reduced, and instead of becoming elected through direct voting, now they have selected on reserved seats for women by political parties,” she said.

Rahima Panhwar from the SPO said that it was heartening to see over 200 councillors in the convention from all the way from Thar. “Networking is one of the most efficient ways to combat GBV collectively. We aim to create a network amongst the councillors, allowing us and the wider public to better grasp the gravity of the issue. We have been playing our part by supporting the commission through monetary means and we ask all of you, to help strengthen the commission,” she said.

Farieha Aziz from the Bolo Bhi said the networks were very important because it was difficult to provide assistance from Karachi, so there must be a system in place to look after the legalities and councilors: “The network should also be able to respond on an emergency basis and it cannot work on a 9 to 5 basis because there is no fixed time for any untoward situation and it should be dealt with on such basis,” she said. Justice (retrd) Majida Rizvi, and rights activists Ali Palh and Zulfiqar Shah also spoke to the convention.",['Our Correspondent'],"Speakers at a women councillors’ convention on Wednesday exhorted the local government representatives elected on reserved seats for women to play their role in combating gender-based violence.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/698975-violence-against-women-child-abuse-up-during-apr-jun,,"Violence against women, child abuse up during Apr-Jun","Islamabad:Violence against women has increased 10 times in the last three months in Pakistan, with four times more cases reported on child abuse and domestic violence according to a report released Monday.

The report states that Punjab is the worst affected region followed by Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The data gathered through print media as well as official sources through the right to information laws, has been reported in a bi-annual tracking report released by Sustainable Social Development Organization (SSDO) covering a period of January to June 2020.

The report titled ‘Tracking Numbers: State of Violence Against Women and Children in Pakistan’ is a sequel to an earlier report published in April this year by SSDO and attempts to present a holistic analysis of children and women rights violations in Pakistan, highlighting their daily risks to safety and security issues. Violence against women shows a drastic increase since March, with 78% of the cases reported from Punjab during the last six months.

A total of 495 cases were reported according to media reports by the end of June out of which 452 were reported only between April and June, while official data shows the total cases reported to be 3,148. While 80% of the total of 576 reported cases of child abuse were also reported from Punjab, especially from April to June this year, according to the report. The official data reports 928 cases in total. Domestic violence cases went up from 32 in the first quarter to 126 in the second quarter, while official sources claim to have 573 cases reported in total over the first six months of the year. There has also been a considerable upsurge in Punjab and Sindh in the cases reported for women kidnapping and rape during the last three months as compared to the preceding three months. The gap between news reports and official data again shows inconsistencies with 444 versus 6,720 kidnappings and 250 versus 1,868 rape cases.

According to the official data, Punjab reported the majority 1,658 (89%) rape cases from a total of 1,868.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/746150-scsw-shirkat-gah-present-policy-document-on-impact-of-covid-19-on-women,,"SCSW, Shirkat Gah present policy document on impact of Covid-19 on women","In a collaborative effort, the Sindh Commission on the Status of Women (SCSW) and the Shirkat Gah Women’s Resource Centre on Thursday held a launch where a policy document was presented to the Sindh government.

The policy document, titled ‘Rising to the Challenges: Gender-Responsive Policy Options for COVID-19 & Other Emergencies’, focuses on the various impacts of Covid-19 on women. As per the policy, in events such as the Covid-19 pandemic, women face considerable threats to their economic, physical, legal and social security. It mentions four areas where there is a lack of emergency services, especially exacerbates issues of access and relief for women and girls across the following. They are “health, gender-based violence, education and economic resilience”.

The policy document recommends immediate legislative actions that need to be implemented, such as expanding the definition of essential services to include all gender-based violence response services and mechanisms to safeguard against any disruption during any emergency or disaster situations, and strengthening services and ensuring access for GBV survivors during all emergencies, including COVID-19. The policy also calls for expediting the implementation of the Sindh Reproductive Healthcare Rights Act 2019 to ensure the maximum number of attendance in schools, as safe reopening is essential, especially for female students, in Sindh.

The launch was attended by parliamentarians, civil society members, labour unions’ members and other stakeholders. Notable guests included Barrister Murtaza Wahab, advisor to Sindh chief minister on law and environment; Khawar Mumtaz, former National Commission chairperson on the Status of Women; Nuzhat Shirin, Sindh Commission chairperson on the Status of Women, Javed Akhbar; the DIG south in Karachi and others.

Nuzhat Shirin highlighted the policy document, explaining the immediate actions the SCSW actively partook during the Covid-19 pandemic. “The Sindh government has no tolerance towards violence against women. When women institutions were closed during the Covid-19 lockdown, we were online and we made commissions; we addressed complaints that women had related to rations,” she said.

Farida Shaheed, executive director of the Shirkat Gah Women’s Resource Centre, presented key takeaways from the policy document and urged the members of the Sindh government to ensure its timely implementation. Aliya Shahid Secretary of the Women Development Department commended the policy document and stated that under the WDD platform, “Sindh’s legislation is the most pro-women, such as the informal home-based workers act has been passed”.

Dr Talib Lashari said women rights could not be ensured “until human capital is invested in and until poverty and education are not focused on”. Virjee Kholi, Sindh Human Rights Department’s special assistant, said: “We need to implement laws and prevent gender-based violence incidents that affect young girls and women.”

Khawar Mumtaz said the interrelationships of different issues faced by women had been taken into account. She emphasised that the violence against women was the biggest barrier for women being involved in anything.

Dr Yasmin Qazi, B&M Foundation senior advocacy consultant, highlighted the importance of reproductive rights and the need for gender sensitivity among men. Barrister Murtaza Wahab, in his closing remarks, lauded the SCSW and the SG for the launch of the policy document. “We have too many challenges as a country and we need to rise up to the challenges.” Wahab said there was a need for the implementation and deliverance of laws, especially towards the gender-based violence cases.","['Oc', 'Our Correspondent']","In a collaborative effort, the Sindh Commission on the Status of Women (SCSW) and the Shirkat Gah Women’s Resource Centre on Thursday held a launch where a policy document was presented to the Sindh government.

The US has been the WHO’s biggest contributor, but in April Trump suspended funding, accusing it of not doing enough to curb COVID-19’s initial spread and of being too soft on China.","['cutting',

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/712822-no-grouping-in-punjab-police-igp,,No grouping in Punjab Police: IGP,"LAHORE: Newly-appointed Inspector General of Police Punjab Inam Ghani has said establishing writ of the state is one of his top priorities. Talking to reporters at Central Police Office after assuming charge of his post and issuing instructions to the officers in his first formal meeting with them, he said, ""The capital city police officer (CCPO) Lahore is subordinate to me. I have no problem with any officer. Tariq Masood Yasin is my batch mate, if he is not satisfied with me then this is his right."" He said that there was no grouping in Punjab Police and all reports regarding grouping of seniors and juniors were contrary to the facts and baseless.

The IG said maintaining law and order in the province, ensuring prompt solution to the problems of citizens and ensuring uniform rule of law are his top priorities. In order to meet the expectations, all the principal staff officers posted in the Central Police Office and the command officers posted in the regions and districts will have to play their effective role in the best possible way, he said. He said the officers and personnel who would bring the oppressors to justice and support the oppressed people would be the vanguard of his team so all the officers should keep themselves active for further improvement in the process of public safety and service delivery. He asked the officers to improve the image of the police in society with their positive attitude.

""I will make sure that transfers and postings are based solely on performance and good reputation so that all officers make selfless service to citizens without any pressure,"" he added. He asserted that ensuring uniform enforcement of the law is one of his top priorities. Adherence to merit, discipline and strict implementation of the SOPs will be ensured, he added.

Besides speeding up free registration of FIRs, special attention would also be given to improve the quality of investigation, he said. He said transforming the police force into a public-friendly force by making an ethical change in its behaviour is an important part of his policy. Along with making the recruitment policy more effective, further upgrade of the training system and transfer, posting and promotion merit observance will be ensured in all cases, he stated.

While answering the questions asked by the media people, IG Inam Ghani said that the team of officers working in all the regions and districts of Punjab comprises of the best professional officers and no one of them will be replaced for any reason but all the field officers, including CPO, have been empowered for supervision. He said that in order to make the working system of the Central Police Office more functional, focus would be on reorganisation and upgrade so that the departmental affairs could be carried out more efficiently and diligently.

He said the Central Police Office is the home of the police officers and any meeting of the officers in it is an internal matter of the police force. He said that CCPO Lahore, all RPOs, CPOs and DPOs are committed to protecting and serving the people by ensuring implementation of government orders and police as a disciplined force.

He said that timely provision of information would improve the relations with the media so that the media would continue to identify crimes as well as publicise the good works of police.

Both are battling viral infections as they race to recover for the clash in Sydney, where the visitors are desperate to salvage some pride after being thrashed in the first two Tests.

Spinner Mitchell Santner is also unwell and did not practise on Thursday, with batsman Glenn Phillips making a late dash to Sydney Thursday evening as cover. “It’s up in the air at the moment — a couple of boys are a little bit crook unfortunately,” said opener Tom Latham, filling in for Williamson in his pre-match press conference.

“They’re having today off, as well as yesterday, so fingers crossed they’ll be right to go tomorrow. “It’s gone around the team a little bit which obviously isn’t ideal, but fingers crossed, they’re resting up and hopefully they’ll wake up tomorrow morning and be good to go.”

If they are not fit, it will leave New Zealand with big problems. Jeet Raval is the only specialist batsman waiting in the wings, but he has been out of form and was dropped for the last Test in Melbourne.

They also have bowlers Todd Astle, Kyle Jamieson, Matt Henry and Will Somerville on standby. Coach Gary Stead stressed Phillips’ inclusion was precautionary and they were still hopeful all players would be fit.

“We’re still hopeful Henry and Kane will pull through and we will give them every chance to prove their fitness,” he said. “Glenn has been in terrific form this season and has good versatility with where he can bat and the roles he can play.”

Latham said it would take a lot for Williamson to miss a Test. “He’s obviously a great leader amongst this group and he’s passionate about this group,” he said.

“If there’s any chance of him paying, even if it’s a small chance, he’ll certainly be playing.” New Zealand need all the help they can get with the opening two Tests at Perth and Melbourne ending in heavy defeats inside four days.

Australia captain Tim Paine has made clear his team has no intention of easing up despite the series being won, after winning all four of this season’s home Tests within four days.",[],"SYDNEY: New Zealand sweated on the fitness of batting kingpin and captain Kane Williamson Thursday after he and Henry Nicholls missed a second day of training ahead of the final Test against Australia.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/91822-Child-abuse-gang-busted,,Child abuse gang busted,"A team of Child Welfare and Protection Bureau busted a gang of three suspects involved in prostitution of children from the Data Darbar police limits on Saturday night.The CPWB team also recovered three children identified as Nabeel, Shoban and Imran, used for prostitution purposes. The victims were aged between 10-12. The CPWB team took them into their custody and sent for medical examination of the victims. Field Officer of CWPB, Fayyaz said that they arrested the accused persons after a month reconnaissance. He said that they did reconnaissance for a month of the area to search the accused persons involved in this crime. He said that they prepared documentary evidences and then caught them red-handed; their team members disguised as customers went to the accused persons and asked them to provide children. The accused persons called the children and presented them to the CWPB team members disguised as ‘customers’. Another team of CWPB raided and arrested the suspects and took the children into their custody. They also called the area police and registered a case against the accused persons. Fayyaz, who also led the operation against these accused persons said that ‘modus operandi’ of the accused persons was to entice the children who have left their home to commit sodomy with them. Afterwards, they would include them into their heinous crime of child prostitution. He said that one of the accused persons would provide space (ie inn or hotel that are in abundance in the locality) for committing the offence. Other accused persons would hunt customers and provide children.

The arrested accused persons were identified as Sabir Kala, Akhtar Ali and Muhammad Asif. Sabir Kala ran an inn/sarai and provided place for the offence.

Spokesperson for CWPB, Muhammad Waseem said that two of the victim children had run from their home. He said that one of the victims would come to play video games in the locality and was trapped by the accused persons.

He said that the suspects gave similar assurances to their team members disguised as ‘customers’ also.

However, SHO Data Darbar, Inspector Javed denied all these allegations. He said that police took action against such crimes. He said that they had sealed many such inns during search operations.

FAISALABAD: Fifteen men who are accused of gang-raping two sisters have still not been arrested by police, reported Geo News on Monday.



Out of the nominated suspects, six obtained interim bail from the court to avoid being arrested whereas efforts are being made to arrest the others who have nominated in the FIR, said the investigation officer Muhammad Aslam.

""DNA tests of the girls have been taken and the report will be received after three days,"" he said.

The complaint had been filed on behalf of the victims' mother, who had stated that her two daughters, one aged 17 years old and the other 15, were kidnapped on September 11 by a group of persons.

She said that her daughters were taken to different locations for six days where they were gang raped by the suspects, who allegedly intoxicated the teenage girls and took indecent photographs and recorded videos of them.

The FIR states that the 15-year-old girl was dropped off at Faisalabad's Jhang Bazar while her sister was left at Gujranwala before the suspects fled.

The woman had said that the family could not take legal action against the suspects on account of poverty hence they decided to leave their residence and settle somewhere else.

However, the suspects did not leave the family alone and continued to catcall and record videos of the teenage sisters wherever they went, stated the complaint.

According to the complaint, the two sisters were travelling with their mother on Millat Road a few days before the complaint was filed when the suspects started recording videos of the girls again.

On being told not to do so, they had allegedly assaulted the mother and her daughters before fleeing.",[],"— The News/FilesFAISALABAD: Fifteen men who are accused of gang-raping two sisters have still not been arrested by police, reported Geo News on Monday.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/442604-musharraf%E2%80%99s-adviser-accuses-lawyer-of-blackmail,,Musharraf’s adviser accuses lawyer of blackmail,"ISLAMABAD: Chaudhry Sarfraz Anjum Kahlon, Political Advisor to former President Gen. (R) Pervez Musharraf, has alleged that Chaudhry Mohammad Aslam Ghumman Advocate who filed a petition against Musharraf in the judge’s detention case was blackmailing him and demanding huge sums of money and other benefits.

However, rejecting the allegation Chaudhry Mohammad Aslam Ghumman alleged that Sarfraz Anjum was threatening him with serious consequences for his family members and he had withdrawn his petition under pressure.

Kahlon alleged that Ghumman was extensively involved in secretly blackmailing senior aides to Musharraf and demanding huge sums of money as well as other benefits in return for disrupting and undermining the case. “I will hereby expose Ghumman as a blackmailer and as being someone who is unfit to act as a petitioner in Pakistani courts,” he added.

He alleged that Ghumman, who got registered an FIR against Musharraf on August 11, 2009 with the Secretariat Police Station for detaining judges in 2007, demanded Rs20 million, foreign visas and free accommodation from him for one year for his whole family in May 2013.

Kahlon said when he flatly refused to accept Ghumman’s demands, the latter said he would teach Musharraf and his aides a lesson by manipulating the legal system to his advantage.

Kahlon said he had evidence of Ghumman’s unlawful role including passport copies and national identity cards of him and all his family members as well as a previously unreleased hand-written attested document signed by Ghumman stating that “he has no objection to the bail of Musharraf in relation to the case.” Ghumman voluntarily provided this documentation.

Kahlon said Ghumman contacted him in early May 2013 and informed him of his decision to voluntarily withdraw from the judges’ detention case.

Ghumman then carried out a 30-minute press conference at a local hotel in Islamabad on May 18, 2013 and stated that he was not under

pressure from any quarters. “I have records showing that the room at the hotel where the press conference was held was booked in the name of Ghumman and was paid for by him.” He said no offer was made to Ghumman prior to addressing the press conference and he did it because he wanted to show how capable and valuable he could be. “Ghumman argued that he had put his legal reputation at stake by carrying out a press conference and that he deserved to be accommodated as he could exert influence to the detriment of Musharraf. He also stated that as a lawyer he knew how to use the criminal justice system to his advantage and that he would get his revenge.”

Kahlon further said that Ghumman later did a U-turn and got a case registered on June 15, 2013 against Col (R) Ilyas, Musharraf’s security officer, claiming that he was receiving life threats from him. Later in June 2013, Ghumman filed a petition with the apex court, challenging the IHC’s order of granting bail to Musharraf after removing terrorism from the charge-sheet and requesting the apex court to set aside the decision and order his arrest.”

He said multiple cases were currently being prepared against Ghumman including extortion (Section 383 of Pakistan Penal Code - punishable by up to 3 years imprisonment), giving false and fabricated evidence to the court (Section 191, 192 - up to seven years imprisonment) and cheating (Section 415 - 1 year imprisonment). Ghumman could face up to a maximum of 11 years imprisonment if found guilty on all charges.

When The News contacted Ghumman, he alleged that Chaudhry Sarfraz Anjum Kahlon was giving threats of serious consequences to his family during the case and was still giving him threats and asking him to leave the country.

He further alleged that during the case Kahlon threatened him and later offered him that he would arrange visa for him and his family. “Unfortunately, I came under the threat and left the case and announced it in a press conference.” Ghumman said during this time he also sent him the copies of passports and CNICs, as he had offered visa for him and family members.

“I am still receiving threats, as I have filed a petition against Col (R) Ilyas, security officer of General Musharraf. They are still forcing me to take the petition back and leave this country as soon as possible,” he alleged.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/681990-fia-arrests-four-suspects-allegedly-involved-in-child-pornography,,FIA arrests four suspects allegedly involved in child pornography,"The ring was being operated from the United States, the FIA said-- File photo

The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in a cross-country crackdown on Saturday arrested four suspects on charges of working for an international child pornography ring.

The agency said that the action was carried out upon the directives of Prime Minister Imran Khan.

The FIA said that global anti-crime agency Interpol had shared relevant information regarding the suspects with Islamabad, following which the law enforcement agency had moved to make the arrests.

The ring was being operated from the United States, the FIA said.

A suspect, identified as Arsalan, was arrested from Sialkot today. He was in contact with the group, said the agency.

According to the FIA, the ring sold pornographic material featuring minors. Officials confiscated 225GB of data from Arsalan alone.

The agency said it is investigating the matter further to uncover more illegal activity and will take appropriate action.

The FIA, using the input from Interpol, also cracked down suspects in various other cities.

Three suspects allegedly involved in child pornography were arrested from Karachi, Faisalabad and Gujranwala.

The FIA said it seized illegal content from the possession of the suspects, adding that further investigation is underway.

Laws against child pornography

In 2016, Pakistan had criminalised child pornography in a historic first, making the offense punishable with seven years in prison and a fine of Rs0.7 million.

The new amendment, titled Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill 2015, also criminalised child trafficking within the country.

The initiative came after the country was rocked by a major pedophilia scandal in August 2015, when it was revealed that hundreds of pornographic videos of children from Hussain Khanwala village in the Punjab province had been made and were being circulated online.",[],"The ring was being operated from the United States, the FIA said-- File photoThe Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in a cross-country crackdown on Saturday arrested four suspects on charges of working for an international child pornography ring.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/253342-girl-13-saved-from-forced-marriage,,"Girl, 13, saved from forced marriage","LAHORE



THE Lahore High Court on Tuesday handed over the custody of over a 13-year old girl, Sadia, to her mother after getting her recovered from her father’s custody who wanted to sell her for forced marriage with a 55-year old man.



Justice Ijaz Ahmed Chaudhry passed this order while disposing of a petition filed by Kausar, mother of the girl, through the Judicial Activism Panel for recovery and protection of the girl.



On Tuesday, Ferozewala DSP Nazar Abbas produced the girl before the court after taking her from the Darul Amaan where she was sent by a magistrate, Yalmaz Ghani, on August 5. The magistrate had also recorded her statement and ordered police to produce her before the LHC. The girl told the judge that her father Arshad and brother-in-law Maqsood along with five others had kidnapped her from her mother’s house and they were bent upon selling her for money. She desired to go with her mother and the judge allowed her to proceed with her mother.



The judge also directed Sheikhupura district police officer and Muridke DSP to provide protection to the girl and her mother and arrest the accused, as no one has been arrested in the case so far. Narang Mandi police have already registered an FIR of kidnapping of Sadia under section 365-B of PPC against seven accused Maqsood Ahmed, Mahboob Ahmed, Irshad, Iqbal Bibi, Iqra, Mah Jabeen and Noor Hussain on the application of Kausar, Sadia’s mother.



Her forced marriage was to be held on July 19 but she escaped and took shelter with her mother who was living separately. JAP Chairman Muhammad Azhar Siddique argued that the girl’s father Irshad Ahmed and brother-in-law Mehboob Ali were forcing her to marry 55-year-old Ijaz in exchange for Rs70,000.



He said the lives of both mother and daughter were in danger at the hands of their family members and other relatives who wanted to give Sadia’s hand to an old aged man. He said the local police also joined hands with

girl’s father and were conducting raids to arrest them. He said the accused had again kidnapped her from her mother’s house on July 25 despite court’s order to the police to provide protection to her. He prayed to the court that the directions be issued to the Punjab chief secretary and home secretary for protection of fundamental rights of citizens of the province as incidents of violation of human rights were on the rise. He also prayed that the police concerned be restrained from harassing minor Sadia and her mother and action be taken against her father and brother-in-law who wanted to sell the girl in the name of marriage.



Three drug dealers jailed: An anti-narcotics court on Tuesday convicted three drug pushers in two cases.



The court awarded 14-year imprisonment to drug dealer Fareed Ahmed Shah. The convict was also fined Rs 500,000. Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) had arrested him and seized 300 kilograms of hashish from his possession. Meanwhile, the court awarded three-year jail term to Manzoor Ahmed and two-year imprisonment to Tanveer Ahmed. The court imposed Rs 300,000 fine on Manzoor and Rs 200,000 fine on Tanveer. They were arrested by the ANF in 2009. The ANF had seized six kilograms of hashish from their possession.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/708372-captainless-wto-in-troubled-water-with-no-land-in-sight,,Captainless WTO in troubled water with no land in sight,"GENEVA: As Roberto Azevedo leaves the World Trade Organization Monday, the institution faces multiple crises without a captain — a situation experts warn could drag on for months. Any future WTO leader will head an organisation mired in stalled trade talks and struggling to curb trade tensions between the United States and China. It must also help member countries navigate a devastating global economic slump sparked by the coronavirus pandemic. The global trade body faces relentless attacks from Washington, which has crippled the WTO dispute settlement appeal system and threatened to leave altogether. Many observers fear that intransigent US positions could paralyse the WTO process of designating a new director general, leaving the organisation leaderless for the foreseeable future. “The US demands that the new DG shares US concerns, many of which are about addressing concerns related to China,” Manfred Elsig, a professor of international relations at the World Trade Institute in Bern told AFP. “Given that the DG is chosen by consensus, this tough stance complicates the selection.

The WTO has already presented a timeline for selecting one of eight candidates in the running to replace Azevedo within a few months. But Elsig warned that “the process is already torpedoed. “It could well be that many WTO members want to wait until after the (US) election, hoping that the administration changes.

Azevedo´s surprise announcement in May that he would end his second WTO term 12 months early forced the organisation to speed up its usually lengthy process of selecting a new leader. Three Africans, two Europeans, two Asians and one Latin American quickly threw their hats in the ring. - ´Confessionals´

The organisation is due next month to begin three rounds of consultations — dubbed “confessionals” — in which all member states confidentially voice their preferences, gradually whittling down the list. The process, based on consensus, is expected to last until mid-November. But soaring international tensions and growing politicisation of picks to head UN agencies and other international organisations could trip up the tentative timeline. Members failed last month to pick an acting chief from among four deputy directors — something that is normally a straightforward process. Brussels and Washington butted heads over whether German Karl Brauner, or American Alan Wolff, should get the job, in what observers say was unprecedented politicisation of an administrative decision.",[],"GENEVA: As Roberto Azevedo leaves the World Trade Organization Monday, the institution faces multiple crises without a captain — a situation experts warn could drag on for months.

GUJRAT: A district court Friday acquitted all those named in the murder of Pakistani-origin Italian citizen Sana Cheema.

Judge Amir Mukhtar Gondal ordered the release of Sana’s father Ghulam Mustafa Cheema, uncle Mazhar Cheema and brother Adnan after 11 months of trial on the benefit of the doubt.

In April 2018, Sana story surfaced after an Italian publication claimed that she had been murdered for ‘honour’ in Pakistan.

The 26-year-old woman was killed in her hometown of Mangowal. She reportedly wanted to marry a man of her own will. Later an autopsy report revealed that the Pakistani-origin Italian girl was strangled.

Police soon arrested Sana’s father, uncle and brother in line with the document’s findings.

During the murder case probe, they revealed that the girl’s father and brother had confessed to their crime in the name of ‘honour’.

Sana’s relatives had earlier claimed she died a natural death. Her parents also submitted forged documents to the Italian embassy. Their assertion was corroborated by medical records detailing her protracted illness and treatment history.

A private hospital denied having admitted the woman over the course of a probe into her death saying Sana had visited the hospital on April 11 and left after being prescribed medicine for nausea.",[],"Accused father, brother, uncle acquittedag INPGUJRAT: A district court Friday acquitted all those named in the murder of Pakistani-origin Italian citizen Sana Cheema.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/296366-family-wanted-for-baldia-honour-killing-arrested-in-islamabad,,Family wanted for Baldia ‘honour’ killing arrested in Islamabad,"A family accused of murdering a man and injuring his brother in Karachi’s Baldia Town last month allegedly over honour have been arrested in Islamabad.

Pervez Khan was struck with sticks and bricks before being stabbed in a house at Hazara Chowk in Gulshan-e-Ghazi on February 15. His brother Shahzaib was also wounded during the incident. Khan, however, succumbed to his injuries during treatment at a hospital.

West Zone Investigation-I SSP Zeeshan Shafique Siddiqui told a news conference in Karachi on Saturday that an FIR of the incident was registered against Khan’s relatives at the Ittehad Town police station.

SSP Siddiqui said the family accused of the murder had escaped from the city, and all the members had also switched off their mobile phones.

Siddiqui formed an investigation team led by the Saeedabad DSP, the Ittehad Town station investigation officer and case investigating officer Anwar Shah Bukhari to arrest the family. He also ordered gathering the call detail records of the suspects.

Several raids were carried out, but the family kept on moving houses. “Police finally found a clue on March 18 that pointed them towards the family’s location in Islamabad,” said the SSP.

“The investigation team was then sent to Islamabad, where they arrested the family in the Sarai Faraal locality with the help of the Golra Sharif police.”

The police officer identified the suspects as Nawabzada Hashim, his wife Zartaj, and their sons Arif and Shahrukh. He said the family were presented before the Islamabad civil & judicial judge for a transit remand, which was granted to the investigation team until March 24.

SSP Siddiqui later told The News that the accused and Khan’s family were related. “On returning home one day, Arif had found Khan with his wife alone in the house.”

The accused family had planned to kill both Khan and Arif’s wife for so-called honour, but the woman managed to escape, added the police officer.

He said Khan’s autopsy report showed that the man’s lips were slit, adding that his body was riddled with bite marks as well as stab wounds.

It was reported last month that 30-year-old Pervez in Hazara Chowk, Gulshan-e-Ghazi, where his cousin Arif attacked Pervez and his brother Shahzaib with a knife and escaped after stabbing them.

Last month The News had reported that Khan was killed and his brother injured when their cousin attacked them in their house in Baldia Town over what police had speculated to be an extramarital affair.

According to Ittehad Town police station’s head moharir, the incident took place in the house of Khan at Hazara Chowk, where his cousin Arif attacked him and his brother Shahzaib with a knife and escaped.

The head moharir said the injured men were taken to the Dr Ruth KM Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, where Khan succumbed to his wounds, while doctors declared Shahzaib safe.

He said the locals had told police that Khan had gone to Arif’s house when he was not around. When Arif returned, he saw Khan alone with his wife.

Quoting residents, the head moharir said Arif then thrashed Khan and threw him out of his house, adding that Arif later went to Khan’s house and attacked him with a knife, and when his younger brother tried to intervene, Arif stabbed him too.",['Our Correspondent'],"A family accused of murdering a man and injuring his brother in Karachi’s Baldia Town last month allegedly over honour have been arrested in Islamabad.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/579148-child-abuse-is-preventable,,Child abuse is preventable,"In March 2000, an additional sessions judge in Lahore sentenced an alleged serial killer Javed Iqbal, 38, to death by hanging for sexually molesting and murdering around 100 destitute children between the ages of 6 to 16. The verdict said that he was to be hanged in a public park in front of the parents whose children he was convicted of murdering.

After he was strangled, Judge Allah Baksh Ranja added, Iqbal's body ""will then be cut into 100 pieces and put in acid the same way he killed the children”.

But Javed was never hanged. After 18 months of the sentence, he died in mysterious circumstances in Kot Lakhpat jail. His two accomplices met the same fate. Although he surrendered to the law in the Jang newspaper office in December 1999, he pleaded not guilty in a court of law and appealed against the verdict in the Shariat court, an appeal which is still pending.

The case itself came to surface in November 1999 when Javed conveyed the details of his crime to the authorities through parcels filled with evidence and pictures of his victims. The self-proclaimed killer left two human skeletons in an acid-filled container at the house from where the police recovered at least nine bags carrying clothes and shoes of the victims.

The parcels also contained a personal diary and a notebook of the self-confessed killer giving every detail of his murder. A letter bearing a confessional statement was also attached with the parcels which read: “I sexually assaulted 100 children before killing them, and disposed of their bodies in barrels of acid.”

Once again on February 12, 2018, an anti-terrorism court, finding Imran Ali, 24, – the man accused of raping and murdering six-year-old Zainab Amin in Kasur – guilty of the charges brought against him, and handed him four counts of the death penalty, one life term, a seven-year jail term and Rs4.1 million in fines.

The four death penalties were for kidnapping, raping and murdering Zainab, and committing an act of terrorism punishable under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA).

One life sentence, along with an Rs1 million fine, was handed to Ali for committing an ""unnatural act."" Two death sentences, accompanied by Rs1 million fine each, were imposed on him under ATA and Pakistan Penal Code. A seven-year jail sentence and Rs100,000 fine were further awarded for concealing the body in a trash heap. Additionally, Rs1 million from the penalties imposed will be paid to the victim's heirs, the judge ruled. Zainab's mother, Nusrat Bibi, demanded that the execution of the death penalties be carried out in public.

Ali faced further charges in the cases of at least seven other children he attacked – five of whom were murdered – in a spate of assaults that had stoked fears that a serial child killer was on the loose.

He was convicted based on his confessional statement to all eight attacks, including the death of Zainab. The Supreme Court also rejected his appeal, noting that he had admitted committing his crimes and did not deserve sympathy. Ali was hanged in October last year.

In both cases, ostensibly to calm public outrage, the judges seem to have applied the maximum moral and legal force they have at their disposal – capital punishments – but have these verdicts made Pakistan safer for children?

Traditional attitudes like ‘family honour’ still imply that a majority of abuse cases go unreported. The severe punishments might even have contributed to culprits killing children after the heinous act to remove any proof of the crime.

It's been 30 years since we committed to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), but our state institutions have failed to ensure that children have human rights, and they should be empowered to claim them.

If the Javed Iqbal case is directly linked to the non-implementation of Article 20 of the CRC, then Imran Ali's relates to not translating Article 19 into the country's institutional framework to protect children.

Focusing at prevention of child abuse, Article 19 calls for appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.

Article 20 calls for special state protection for a child temporarily or permanently deprived of his or her family environment, or in whose own best interests cannot be allowed to remain in that environment. When considering solutions, due regard shall be paid to the desirability of continuity in a child's upbringing and to the child's ethnic, religious, cultural, and linguistic background.

But the story does not end here. At the start of the century Pakistan also signed the protocol to eliminate sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. The document calls for adopting a holistic approach, addressing the contributing factors, including underdevelopment, poverty, economic disparities, inequitable socio-economic structure, dysfunctioning families, lack of education, urban-rural migration, gender discrimination, irresponsible adult sexual behaviour, harmful traditional practices, armed conflicts and trafficking in children. It also aims at efforts to raise public awareness to reduce consumer demand regarding pornography.

But before the state addresses all this, early last month, police in Rawalpindi arrested Sohail Ayaz for allegedly sexually abusing 30 children. Police have recovered more than a hundred videos from his laptop computer, which he reportedly sold on the dark web.

An investigation is still on to determine the exact magnitude of the local crime which may be linked to the international dark web which was recently busted by multinational police.

In October this year American, British and South Korean officials busted one of the world's largest child sexual exploitation networks. An analysis of a server seized by South Korean authorities revealed that the website had more than one million bitcoin addresses, signifying that the website had a capacity for at least one million users.

The operation led to the rescue of at least 23 minor victims residing in the United States, Spain, and the United Kingdom, who were being actively abused by users of the site. Officials said that hundreds of suspects had been charged worldwide for their alleged involvement with ""the largest darknet child pornography website,"" funded by Bitcoin.

While recapping our policing networks, the Pakistani policymakers must realize that child abuse is preventable. The initial response should come in by equipping children, parents, community elders, and school teachers on how to prevent abuse.

Given the fact that the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) will remain lower – hovering around 30 percent in the near future – and the country will continue to have a youth bulge, ensuring a safer country for children to grow up in is a priority.

The initial response should come in by equipping children, parents, community elders, and school teachers on how to prevent abuse.","['child', 'javed', 'children', 'million', 'killer', 'zainab', 'abuse', 'death', 'preventable', 'court', 'act']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/700X390_thenews.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg,1,FALSE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'Child abuse is preventable | Opinion | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'In March 2000, an additional sessions judge in Lahore sentenced an alleged serial killer Javed Iqbal, 38, to death by hanging for sexually molesting and murdering around 100 destitute children...', 'keywords': 'child,abuse,preventable', 'fb': {'app_id': 650123461797330}, 'og': {'title': 'Child abuse is preventable', 'image': {'identifier': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'secure_url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'width': 390}, 'description': 'In March 2000, an additional sessions judge in Lahore sentenced an alleged serial killer Javed Iqbal, 38, to death by hanging for sexually molesting and murdering around 100 destitute children...', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/579148-child-abuse-is-preventable', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@thenews_intl', 'creator': '@NINadeem Iqbal', 'title': 'Child abuse is preventable', 'description': 'In March 2000, an additional sessions judge in Lahore sentenced an alleged serial killer Javed Iqbal, 38, to death by hanging for sexually molesting and murdering around 100 destitute children...', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg?t=015814'}, 'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style': 'black-translucent', 'apple-mobile-web-app-title': 'The News International', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#333333', 'theme-color': '#000000'})",[],news

The agreement was signed in the presence of UN Resident Coordinator of Pakistan Niel Buhne. The agreement will be functional from August 2017 to August 2019 and total cost is $250,000, which has initially been mobilized as first trench to start and implement activities by all participating agencies in the first one year. The WHO’s share out of this agreement is $50,000 for the first year.

In this important interagency programme partnership, WHO would be leading the health component of the programme for Strengthening Health System Response to Gender Based Violence all over Pakistan. The interventions are through capacity building of care providers and community health workers in prevention of different forms of violence; first line support to survivors including counselling and psychological care; identification of GBV cases and proper history taking, clinical care and treatment of injuries including HIV prevention; referral to different social services; further medical treatment and legal aid and testing; medico-legal care and examination of victims of sexual violence including child survivors.

Speaking on the occasion, WHO Representative Dr. Muhammad Assai welcomed this important partnership to promote joint UN work and integrated approach to strengthen capacities and delivery of essential services to women, girls and children who are vulnerable groups regarding their social and economic status according to the recent preliminary results of the population census.

“We cannot have women, girls and children be left behind in health, development and well-being because they are experiencing violence, discrimination, exploitation, poverty and inequality,” Dr Assai said, adding that in Pakistan, only 19.3 percent of women reach secondary education while female participation in the labour market is 24.6 percent compared to 82.9 percent for men.

Women’s proportion in public service is only 5% and 32% of women aged 15-49 years have experienced physical violence since the age of 15. “We cannot achieve the SDG goals including Universal Health Coverage if women, girls and children are denied services due to discrimination in their homes and communities. We stand ready to play our role through prevention and capacity building interventions. The joint UN initiative on essential services is an important opportunity for us to contribute and work together for improving the health and well-being of women, girls and children in Pakistan,” he concluded.",[],"Islamabad: The World Health Organisation (WHO) signed an agreement with UNWOMEN, UNFPA and UNODC here Tuesday to launch a Joint Programme on Essential Services for Women and Girls subjected to Violence and Discrimination Based on Gender and Social Norms in Pakistan (2017-19).

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/465072-bill-against-marriage-under-18-sails-through-senate,,Bill against marriage under 18 sails through Senate,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate Monday passed the Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Bill, 2018, seeking amendment in the 1929’s Child Marriage Restraint Act, defining child is a person, who is under 18 years of age, and criminalising under age weddings.

The piece of legislation will now go to the National Assembly, where it is most likely to face stronger resistance from JUI-F, JI and other like-minded parties. The proposed law increases simple imprisonment from one month or with fine up to Rs1000 to rigorous imprisonment up to three years but not less than two years while the fine will be up to Rs200000.

The clause by clause reading of the bill, moved by PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman, was marred by loud shouts of ‘no’, ‘no’ by senators, belonging to mainly Jamiat Ulema Islam (Fazl) and Jamaat-e-Islami, namely Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, Maulana Attaur Rehman, Mushtaq Ahmad and Maulana Faiz Muhammad. Minister for Religious Affairs Qari Noorul Haq Qadri walked out after he was not allowed to speak when the bill adoption process was under way.

Six senators left their seats and came forward in front of the Senate Chairman, Muhammad Sadiq Sanjrani’s dais, close to the Senate Secretary General Amjed Malik to register their protest, insisting the bill was against the Shariah and it should be referred to the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) for its opinion. They emphasised it must not be passed in the present shape. These senators also opposed fixing puberty age at 18 years. The chair had to expunge his observation that ‘the bill was passed unanimously’, after these senators pointed out their stiff opposition to it

The House witnessed a lively discussion prior to the chair putting the bill for clause by clause reading. PPP Senator Farooq H Naek contended that despite the law, the wedding would still be valid, if it involved a person below 18, but such act was being criminalised. He noted that if the related law was not the Quranic text, then it would be looked into and similarly, there was a way of ‘ijtehad’ and ‘ijma’.

The former chairman Senate also noted that there was no question of any debate, if the 18 years of age had been fixed in the Holy Quran. He said that 18 years had been fixed in the Pakistan Penal Code with regards to an offence, which is committed by an adult and anyone below it could be not be awarded death penalty. He supported voting on the bill.

Senator Sherry Rehman, who was the mover of the bill, said the fixing of age for child was imperative to discouraging (forced) child marriages and added that the age for obtaining a CNIC was also 18 years and so was the case for a person to qualify for being a voter. Senator Sherry referred to a number of Muslim countries, where minimum age for wedding had been fixed at 18 years and these include Bangladesh, Turkey, Morocco, Oman and Egypt while the Saudi Consultative Council had also recommended fixing age at 18. “Calling such issues the Western values is not incorrect,” she insisted.

Former chairman Senate Mian Raza Rabbani rose to clarify to the government, which at one point, appeared inclined to referring the bill to the CII, saying the bill during his term as chairman, was referred to the council, which was still pending. Then Senator Sehar Kamran had moved a similar bill previously in the House.

He also said that a similar bill had been adopted by the Sindh assembly and till to date, neither any individual nor a party had challenged it there. Senator Rabbani noted that sending the bill to the council again would be like putting it in a cold storage.

Earlier, Minister Noorul Haq Qadri recalled that a was introduced in the National Assembly in 2012-13 by Begum Attiya Inayatullah and Marvi Memon about which the council had observed that it was in conflict with the Islamic injunctions. It had also objected to fixing puberty age, saying it varied from person to person. And the bill was then withdrawn.

Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan played safe by saying that while the intent of the mover was indeed noble but it would be better to refer the bill to the council.

Senators Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, Maulana Attaur Rehman, Mushtaq Ahmad and Faiz Muhammad said that on the very first day, when the bill was introduced in the House, they had opposed it called for its referral to the council. They cautioned that its adoption would give opportunity to clerics to raise their voice from their pulpits that the Senate was passing such laws, which ran contrary to Islamic principles.

They insisted that fixing puberty age 18 was against the Islamic teachings and would encourage sins in the society. Leader of the House Syed Shibli Faraz said that he was present in the House standing committee meeting, which had deliberated on the bill and the viewpoint of the council was not clear; it was like running with the hare and hunting with the hound.",['Mumtaz Alvi'],"ISLAMABAD: The Senate Monday passed the Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Bill, 2018, seeking amendment in the 1929’s Child Marriage Restraint Act, defining child is a person, who is under 18 years of age, and criminalising under age weddings.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/714234-kp-police-stations-get-financial-autonomy,,KP police stations get financial autonomy,"PESHAWAR: In a landmark decision to reform the force and discourage corruption at the police station level, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police have formally delegated the powers of drawing and disbursing officers (DDOs) to the station house officers (SHOs), it was learnt on Saturday.

The capital city police is among the first districts to authorise the SHOs as DDOs. An official said this would end corrupt practices by some of the SHOs who would make huge money on the pretext of running the affairs of the police stations.

“In Exercise of the powers delegated by the inspector general of police, the station house officers of Peshawar are hereby authorised as DDOs for their police stations,” stated a notification issued by Capital City Police Officer Mohammad Ali Gandapur. The copies of the notification were also sent to the State Bank of Pakistan and the Accountant General office in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Those declared as DDOs are currently heading 31 police stations in Cantt, City, Rural and Saddar divisions of the capital city police. An official said that soon the ministerial staff would be posted in these police stations to process the account after which all the police stations would get a budget. The provincial government had issued a notification in March declaring all SHOs as DDOs. Many junior officers believe that financial autonomy to the SHOs would help improve policing. However, it was said it will be tough for some of the SHOs. An official said that almost all the SHOs had applied to be given the DDO powers a few days ago. Some of them have already prepared the raw sketch of their own budget. The federal government had last year proposed a number of reforms in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab Police, seeking comments from the officials concerned in the two provinces. Under the proposed reforms, the SHOs were also to be given financial autonomy.

Many junior policemen said the SHOs used to contribute from ‘own resources’ for running the affairs of the police station due to lack of enough funds from their district heads. These officers believe that a district police head needs to post an upright and competent cop as SHO and give him financial autonomy to improve law and order in his area.",['Javed Aziz Khan'],"Those declared as DDOs are currently heading 31 police stations in Cantt, City, Rural and Saddar divisions of the capital city police.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/596493-not-an-isolated-event,,Nankana Sahib incident and forced conversions: Not an isolated event,"A view of Nankana.— Photo by Rahat Dar

On January 3, a charged mob gathered outside Gurdwara Nankana Sahib, the gurdwara built on what was believed to be the place where the founder of Sikhism, Baba Guru Nanak was born. The mob chanted anti-Sikh slogans, vowing to oust the minority Sikh community from the town named after their spiritual leader Baba Nanak: The mob was led by Muhammad Imran who also pledged to change the name of the town after ‘purifying’ it. Local police arrested Imran a day after his speech caused a huge unrest as it went viral on social media.

Many in the mob were related to the family of Muhammad Ehsan, who had allegedly forcibly converted 18-year-old Sikh girl Jagjit Kaur – daughter of a granthi (reciter of holy verse/priest) in the Gurdwara after kidnapping her. Muhammad Imran is Ehsan’s elder brother.

Ehsan’s family members were protesting outside the gurdwara against the arrest and the alleged pressure of local administration to return the girl to her family after divorcing her, a local who lives in the same street tells The News on Sunday.

“The two families live nearby. The boy and the girl had been in contact for several months,” he claims.

The Sikh community, however, claims that the boy abducted their girl and forcibly converted and married her. The matter is pending before a court. On August 28, 2019, Jagjit Kaur’s family lodged a first information report (FIR) against Ehsan and his family, accusing them of abducting and forcibly converting Kaur to Islam. The issue attached cross-border attention due to the strained Indo-Pak relations, India’s internal politics around its citizenship laws that are seen making Muslims in the country vulnerable, and the recent opening of Kartarpur Corridor for Sikhs by Pakistan.

Forced conversions are not new in the country, but this one comes at a particularly turbulent time. Data on such reported cases in the press, complied by Centre for Social Justice (CSJ), a non-government organisation working on minority rights, shows as many as 160 cases of forced conversions over the past six years (2013-2019). In Sindh, in 16 cases, the girls sought judicial relief.

There has been a clear pattern, girls from religious minority communities are kidnapped and later converted to Islam in areas where said religious minorities comprise a sizable proportion of the population. In Sindh, such cases mostly take place in areas populated by Hindus like Umar Kot, Ghotki and Tharparkar districts. In the Punjab, similar incidents are reported in areas where the Christian community are in sizable numbers. According to a senior resident of Nankana Sahib, a few such cases within the Sikh community have also taken place in the past but remained under-reported in mainstream media. In most of the reported cases, the age of the converted girls is between 18 and 21 year and after alleged ‘elopement’, they convert to Islam and get certification from a religious seminary.



“Until and unless there are independent investigations in such cases, we cannot say that these are willful conversions and elopements,” says Peter Jacob, the executive director of CJS.

There is a growing awareness of this issue, but state institutions have moved very slowly, and there is a lack of serious legislation and independent investigations by the state administrative machinery.

“Analysis of these cases reveals the range of legal loopholes, procedural irregularities and socio-cultural factors contributing to impunity available to perpetrators,” says Peter Jacob, the executive director of CJS.

“Forced conversion remains an abuse of law which needs to be tackled”, he says, adding, “Until and unless there are independent investigations in such cases, we cannot say that these are willful conversions and elopements.”

Recently, a parliamentary committee has been formed on forced conversions. The committee comprises 14 members of the National Assembly and eight senators and is will be defining its terms soon.

MNA Kheeal Das Kohistani, a member of this committee, raises an important question. He says that in his experience, there has hardly been a case in which a boy from minority religious community has eloped with a Muslim girl and converted her to his faith.

“We do not ignore the possibility that there are some cases where a boy and girl develop feelings for each other in a society like ours; but mostly there appears to be a pattern of kidnapping, forced conversion and marriage. Strong Muslim personalities in the area protect the perpetrators,” he says.

He says that even after complaints are made by the aggrieved families, independent investigation does not take place in most cases due to public pressure. He also questions the need for changing the girl’s religion after marriage.

“There is a need for strong legislation on this issue. We want to suggest that such marriages and conversions should not be treated as isolated cases, there should be a mechanism, and laws to protect minority girls; and there should be an environment conducive to policy implementation,” adds Kohistani.

Article 20 of the constitution in clearly protects most of the internationally recognized fundamental rights including freedom to profess, practice and propagate any religion. However, there are implementation challenges and violation of rights of religious minorities is a continuing cause for concern.

There have been efforts in the past to enact law for protection of minorities by the members in Sindh Assembly: Protection of Minorities Bill 2015 failed to get support in the Senate and the National Assembly, the legislation on Criminal Law Amendment IV 2017 is yet to be initiated. In 2017, The National Assembly had passed a Criminal Law (Amendment) Act IV, to add Section 498B that made forced marriage with a non-Muslim woman an offense punishable with five to seven years of imprisonment and fine. However, the bill did not get approval from the Senate.

Pakistan also has international obligations relating to protecting women’s rights and religious freedoms. In 2016, the United Nations committee on human rights expressed concern on the practice of forced conversion of non-Muslim women and forced marriages in Pakistan. In 2018, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights wrote to the Pakistani foreign minister to “Guarantee freedom of religion or belief for all. Ensure the protection of religious minorities, including through repealing or amending blasphemy laws and anti- Ahmadi laws; and preventing forced marriages and conversion of religious minority women.”

In a positive move, however, the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), which examines laws to ensure they are congruent with the spirit of Islam, last week, decided to include minority leaders in the consultation process on issue of forced conversion of religion. The body is of the view that Islam does not allow forced conversion.

“Minority girls in their adolescence have been facing harassment and violence, kidnap and rape under the pretext of conversion to Islam. But this move induces hope and shows that we have made some progress and there is an acknowledgment of the gravity of this issue,” says Jacob, hoping the newly-formed parliamentary committee will also discuss the proposals on impending legislation to curb coercive, forced and unethical faith conversions, coinciding with equally detestable marriage of the minority women against their will,” he says.

ISTANBUL: President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned on Saturday that Turkey would never accept charges the Ottoman Empire committed genocide against Armenians in World War I, saying the accusations were being used as ""blackmail"" against Ankara.

In his most bitter reaction yet to the vote by the German parliament Thursday to recognise the killings from 1915 as genocide, Erdogan threatened to leave Europe ""to its own worries"" if such disputes were not resolved.

""The issue here is not the Armenians.... The Armenian issue is used all over the world as a convenient blackmail against Turkey and has even started to be used as a stick,"" he said in a televised speech.

""I am addressing the whole world. You may like it, you may not. Our attitude on the Armenian issue is clear from the beginning. We will never accept the accusations of genocide.""

He said that during World War I, what remained of the Ottoman Empire was ""under siege from all sides"" and ""of course a number of measures were taken to restore order in Anatolia"". The vote in the German parliament added yet another bone of contention to Turkey’s troubled relationship with the European Union, which it has sought to join since 1987. ""Either we find solutions to our problems in a fair way. Or Turkey will stop being a barrier in front of the problems of Europe. We will leave you to your own worries,"" Erdogan added to cheers, without specifying further.

Armenians say some 1.5 million of their people were killed in a genocidal campaign by Ottoman forces -- ordered by Minister of War Enver Pasha and other top officials -- to wipe them from Anatolia.

But Turkey insists similar numbers of Muslims and Armenians were killed during wartime conflict sparked when Armenians joined forces with invading Russian troops in the hope of carving out their own state.

Meanwhile, Turkey declared a round-the-clock curfew in rural areas near the city of Diyarbakir in southeast Turkey on Saturday, ahead of a planned military operation targeting Kurdish militants, the provincial governor’s office said.

The move came a day after Turkish security forces called an end to operations targeting Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) fighters in the town of Nusaybin near the Syrian border and in Sirnak near the border with Iraq.

More than 1,000 people, mostly PKK fighters, have been killed in three months of clashes in those areas, security sources say.

The fighting resumed in the largely Kurdish southeast last July after the collapse of a two-year-old ceasefire.

The latest curfew was declared at 10:30 am (0730 GMT) in 10 areas of Lice, in Diyarbakir province, where PKK militants including senior operatives were believed to be active, the statement said.

The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey and its Western allies, launched its insurgency in 1984 and more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict, now at its most intense level in two decades.",[],"Or Turkey will stop being a barrier in front of Europe’ISTANBUL: President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned on Saturday that Turkey would never accept charges the Ottoman Empire committed genocide against Armenians in World War I, saying the accusations were being used as ""blackmail"" against Ankara.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/715503-girl-dies-after-falling-in-school-in-karachi,,Girl dies after falling in school in Karachi,"KARACHI: As the schools reopened on Tuesday after a long break due to COVID-19, a 14-year-old student died after falling from the stairs in her school in Karachi’s Gulberg area.

The teenager was identified as Areeba, daughter of Asif, and was a grade nine student at the Happy Palace School, Girls Campus, near Ayesha Manzil. The police team reached the school and initiated investigation into the case. An inquiry committee was also formed to investigate the incident by the education department.

According to school management, apparently the teenager’s foot twisted while she was climbing the six-step stairs after which she fell. According to the school, Areeba was rushed to a private hospital where she succumbed to her injuries. Later, the body was shifted to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital.

The family of the deceased student alleged that the teenager passed away due to the negligence of the school management and that the management did not take their child to hospital. They did not inform them of the situation.

The Sindh Education Minister, Saeed Ghani, has sought a report of the incident from DG Private Schools Mansoob Siddique. “The tragedy should be thoroughly investigated,” Ghani directed, inquiring as to why the school administration did not take the girl to hospital immediately after the accident.

No case was registered till the filing of this news story as the parents of the deceased girl reportedly refused to take any action against the school management. The schools, colleges and universities across Pakistan reopened today after six months. The schools were closed in March following emergence of COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier on August, 2019, in a tragic incident, a Grade VI student Zeeshan Durrani drowned in the swimming pool of his school during a swimming class. A case of ‘Qatl-e-Khata’ was registered against the instructors and the school management. Eleven-year-old Usman, son of Zeeshan Durrani, was a Grade VI student of the Habib Public School.

Also on October 2018, a class-seven student died after falling off from the second floor of his school in Block-17 of Gulberg. Police said that 11-year-old Habibullah Ismail fell from the second floor mysteriously. He was taken to the Ziauddin Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. His parents insisted that someone had pushed their child him from the second floor and refused the school version that he had jumped from there. They held the school administration responsible for the incident.",['Faraz Khan'],"According to school management, apparently the teenager’s foot twisted while she was climbing the six-step stairs after which she fell.

“We offer our deepest sympathy to the family affected by this horrific act and share hopes for her full recovery.

“While it is encouraging to see that the police managed to rescue the child and arrest one of the alleged perpetrators, greater efforts must be made to develop mechanisms that help prevent sexual abuse against children. We need to make sure that victims can access appropriate counselling and treatment, and that perpetrators are held accountable,” Girma added.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/713367-punjab-law-minister-says-motorway-gang-rape-blind-incident-with-no-evidence,,Motorway gang rape 'blind incident with no evidence': Punjab law minister,"Punjab law minister Raja Basharat addressing the media after surveying the crime scene, on September 11, 2020. — Geo News

Punjab law minister Raja Basharat on Friday said that the motorway gang rape reported earlier this week is a ""blind incident with no evidence"".

The law minister was addressing the media after having surveyed the crime scene on Lahore's Ring Road highway.

Late Wednesday night, a woman was allegedly assaulted, raped and robbed by multiple men in front of her children when her car ran out of fuel outside Lahore, near Gujjarpura.

""This is a blind incident. There is no overt evidence to take the matter forward. We will have to develop the evidence through an investigation and have it corroborated and only then will we be able to get to a point where we can have a concrete picture,"" the law minister said.

He said he ""accepts"" that it is a challenge for the Lahore police, and therefore, is a challenge for the Punjab government.

""Our monitoring committee is reviewing all administrative aspects and we are looking at how we can take the investigation forward,"" Basharat said.

""There is a special committee formed by the IGP which is probing the incident under which about 28 teams are working. They are looking at the case from various angles

""Whatever evidence we could collect from the crime scene we did and the forensic team will present a report soon. The lady's medical tests have also been carried out,"" he added.

At this time the Punjab government and Chief Minister Usman Buzdar's ""total emphasis"" is on apprehending the culprits.

The law minister said that the people's sentiments were high at the moment and so is the government sorrowful over the incident.

""The provincial government is responsible for the safety of our women [...] we will put forward recommendations to the chief minister so that such incidents do not occur in the future.""

He said the Punjab Highway Patrolling Authority was made dysfunctional but now the chief minister has approved the purchase of new cars for the unit and for better patrolling, 500 new cars are being purchased for the police force in general.

Basharat said the people's confidence will be restored when the culprits are brought to justice and ""no one responsible will be able to escape punishment"".

To a question regarding why — even though the motorway has been functional for eight months — motorway police say it hasn't been handed over to them, and how he thinks crime can be controlled when the police station that has jurisdiction is a whole 10 kilometres away, Basharat said the matter is between the National Highway Authority and Frontier Works Organisation.

""We are also examining this aspect of the matter — why there was an ineffective patrolling system. NHA says some work is remaining [...] but this is a separate matter,"" the law minister said.

'Eyewitness' surfaces

Meanwhile, a man claiming to be an eyewitness to the incident, told Geo News via telephone that he ""saw one of the robbers dragging the woman out to the fields"".

""The man was also slapping the woman,"" he claimed, adding that one other man was standing behind her car.

The man said he called the 15 police helpline to inform them of the incident.",[],"Punjab law minister Raja Basharat addressing the media after surveying the crime scene, on September 11, 2020.

KARACHI: Raheela, who hails from Ghotki, dreamed of becoming a doctor. But when she was 12 years old, she was about to be married to a man in his 60s, in exchange for his daughter marrying Raheela’s father.

Raheela’s neighbour — a community health worker (CHW) who had received training from the NGO Aahung, which aims to improve sexual and reproductive health — found out about the impending marriage. She counselled Raheela, equipped her with communication skills so she could employ them to discuss her situation with her parents.

Raheela negotiated her case with the help of the CHW by making her family aware of the health consequences she might have to endure if she were to get married and become pregnant too early.

Her mother, who was also a child bride, helped Raheela escape the situation and sent her to Khairpur to live with the latter’s sister and get an education. Today Raheela is a CHW and helps young girls in her neighbouring community realise their true potential.

Aahung Executive Director Sheena Hadi shared this story at the Stop Child Abuse Conference, which was organised by Catwalk Cares, the CSR Division of Catwalk Event Management & Productions, on Saturday.

Citing the NGO Girls Not Brides’ estimates, Sheena said that 21 per cent of the girls are married off by the age of 18, which is the sixth highest rate in the world. She said the driving factors of such child marriages are honour codes and customary practices, gender discrimination, family honour, lack of education and lack of economic security. Sindh is the only Pakistani province to have passed a law to set 18 as the minimum age for marriage, she added.

Girls’ education: Writer and former federal information minister Javed Jabbar said that millions of girls are forced to sit at home once they pass the fifth grade.

He said that in Pakistan’s 70-year history, the country’s primary enrolment, however, has been increasing. “Girls’ education worldwide and in Pakistan has increased but, of course, that is not enough. There is so much to be done.”

He added that at the SOS Children’s Villages Pakistan, an NGO, they do not use the word “orphans” for children without parents but “disadvantaged children”.

“We have two daughters who witnessed the murder of their mother at the hands of their own father. That kind of trauma is a very difficult burden for a child,” said the ex-minister.

“It’s also a kind of an abuse, because this has left a stain on the minds of these two daughters. It will be there forever,” he said. Through education, trainings and counselling these stains can be addressed, he added.

Jabbar, who also co-chaired the Planning Committee of the first United Nations World Summit for Children, shared a reason with the audience for Pakistan to take pride.

He recalled that while he was serving in the then prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s first cabinet, she asked him to be her personal representative to help organise the first world summit for children.

He said Pakistan was honoured because Benazir was elected one of the two co-chairs of the world summit, which was to be held in September 1990. “We worked to bring together 72 heads of state for the first time.” He added that Pakistan organised the summit but Benazir was not able to co-preside the event because her government was toppled in August 1990. “The role of Pakistan, however, was acknowledged.”

Jabbar said that Unicef head James Grant wrote to him to say that because of Pakistan’s leadership, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child became the fastest-ever convention adopted in the UN’s history.

Speaking about the convention, he said that it is the first document that was accepted by all the nations irrespective of jurisdictional, religious or cultural boundary.

The former minister also spoke about non-violent abuse, which, he said, is invisible and intangible, as it cannot be measured or calculated. “Even without violence, we can and we do abuse children.”

He said that the prime responsibility lay with the parents. Even within the ambit of parental love, there can be cruelty, repression, suppression or imposition, he added.

Multiple interventions

Singer and humanitarian Shehzad Roy said that awareness regarding child abuse has become a part of the curriculum in Sindh and Balochistan. “We need multiple interventions when we talk about child abuse,” he said, adding that there is this mindset that needs to be changed.

Roy stressed a strong child protection unit, under which the police and the health, education and social welfare departments should work. “In Pakistan this child protection unit is dead.” He said that when child abuse occurs in the school or at home, it is less a law and order issue and more a societal one, which is why the social welfare department has to step forward. Unfortunately, it does not happen this way in the country, he added.

The singer said that until 2012, Section 89 of the Pakistan Penal Code allowed a teacher to hit a child in good faith until the minor bled. This law was later challenged, and in 2013 it was changed by the National Assembly, for whose advocacy, he said, the Geo group played a very important role.

Regarding parents hitting their children and being encouraged, he said that after a child is born their parents beat them, in school their teachers hit them and when they go out to work the SHO beat them up.

“This hitting culture in our society has extended to a level that the idea has taken root in our minds that issues can only be resolved through violence and beating.” The humanitarian said that one out of every five people in the country have experienced some form of sexual abuse. He said they need to keep the debate on child violence alive.

During the panel discussion, Roy shed light on the trauma in the wake of child abuse. He said that in school, children are taught how to react if confronted with any kind of abuse, like informing their parents, siblings or teachers. “If the father does it, who would the child tell it to?”

He asked what would happen after a child informs their teacher or a counsellor about the abuse, saying that usually the family members get involved, families break apart or the child is married off. “It’s a very complicated issue,” he said, adding that one thing that can be done is social re-engineering, as law-making and its implementation alone cannot do anything.

‘Know your children’

Dr Manizeh Bano, executive director of NGO Sahil, spoke about child sex abuse and how necessary it is for the parents to know their children. She stressed meaningful interactions between the parents and their kids. She said parents should know where their children go and what friends they have.

Referring to recent cases, she said adolescents have been found to be involved in child sex abuse. Speaking about the profile of an abuser, she said that it is not necessary that he has a big moustache.

Citing foreign researches, she said abusers characteristically are anti-social and angry, lack self-confidence, are very impulsive, cannot empathise, have low self-esteem, exhibit deviant sexual behaviour or are drug users.

Dr Manizeh said the abuser always has power over their victims, of position, age, physical strength or family strength. She said children should be taught not to accept gifts from others and they must not be allowed to go anywhere with anyone without asking the family.

Child rights activist Rana Asif, actor and Special Olympics Pakistan ambassador Sarwat Gilani, actor and social activist Sheheryar Munawar, actor and social activist Adnan Malik, actor and Human Development Foundation ambassador Ahsan Khan, humanitarian Shaniera Akram, director and actor Angeline Malik, psychiatrist Fawad Suleman, barrister and human rights lawyer Hassaan Niazi and Catwalk CEO Frieha Altaf also spoke on the occasion.",[],"Aahung Executive Director Sheena Hadi shared this story at the Stop Child Abuse Conference, which was organised by Catwalk Cares, the CSR Division of Catwalk Event Management & Productions, on Saturday.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/683468-trump-s-war,,Trump’s war,"President Donald Trump chose a national holiday traditionally intended for joy and unity to deliver dark, combative harangues against a “radical ideology” that is no more than “violent mayhem” designed to overthrow law and order.

In speeches at Mount Rushmore on Friday evening and on the South Lawn of the White House Saturday to commemorate America’s 244th birthday, Trump minced no words and stayed true to form in appealing to his conservative and white supremacist base by making clear he was taking sides in a burgeoning culture war between honoring a past scarred with racism and civil war and a “new far-left fascism” that seeks a future of social justice free of inequality. He couldn’t have been more divisive.

“Their goal is not a better America. Their goal is the end of America,” he said of demonstrators demanding social justice reforms of police departments nationwide, among them the Black Lives Matter movement.

Trump appealed to his few thousand admirers Friday in an amphitheater beneath the carved busts of four presidents in the Black Hills of South Dakota to honor the monuments and statues saluting America’s past, shunning the fervor of the present in which millions of Americans have marched for their country to bring alive the ideals invoked in sacred documents that have guided American jurisprudence and for which Americans have died from the green fields of Lexington and Concord to the bloodied sands of Iraq and Afghanistan.

“The radical ideology attacking our country advances under the banner of social justice,” Trump said. “But in truth, it would abolish both justice and society. It would transform justice into an instrument of division and vengeance and turn our free society into a place of repression, domination and exclusion. They want to silence us, but we will not be silenced.”

That’s most of what Trump has been doing for 3.5 years.

He is seeking reelection against a growing tide of what Trump branded a “left-wing cultural revolution” that has toppled statues of Confederate generals, slave owners and even of Columbus in a quest for recognition of the need for racial justice. He condemned a social movement that since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis May 25 has pushed for an end to police brutality against Blacks and other minorities.

Most of the demonstrations have been peaceful but Trump inflated their impact, making it sound as if protesters were rampaging through cities on a wave of destruction that he characterized as “violent mayhem.”

“Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values and indoctrinate our children,” he told the crowd in which few wore masks or practiced social distancing. “Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders, deface our most sacred memorials and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities.”

Trump recently signed an executive order to punish people who destroy monuments on federal property.

His position is well known by now, from his saying there are “very fine people on both sides” at the demonstration in Charlottesville in 2017 in which one woman was killed to his condemnation of Black football players for kneeling during the national anthem that cost one his career.

But the protests for change may be inspiring Americans more than Trump and his fellow Republicans may realize, creating more of a backlash to the president’s policies, including his refusal to take charge of the pandemic, leaving it to governors and mayors, and calling on the military to suppress demonstrations in Washington, DC, and elsewhere.

Civics Analytics, a data company whose clients include Democratic campaigns, released four recent polls that indicate between 15 million to 26 million Americans have participated in demonstrations over Floyd’s killing, The New York Times reported Saturday. Further, 500,000 people staged protests in nearly 550 locations countrywide on June 6.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/679862-timely-intel-alert-and-police-preparedness-foiled-psx-attack,,Timely intel alert and police preparedness foiled PSX attack,"ISLAMABAD: It was the perfect combination of timely issuance of intelligence alerts and quick response by policy and security officials that has foiled Indian-backed BLA’s terrorist attack on the Pakistan Stock Exchange on Monday.

Informed sources said that the intelligence agencies had the information that the terrorist may attack certain targets in Karachi. Intelligence alerts were also issued one of which had clearly identified Pakistan Stock Exchange as the possible target of the terrorists.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/431427-treating-child-abuse-as-taboo-painful-mazari,,Treating child abuse as taboo painful: Mazari,"Islamabad: Ministry of Human Rights has launched an awareness campaign to prevent child abuse on Tuesday.

Federal Minister for human rights Dr. Shireen Mazari initiated the campaign by visiting Islamabad College of Arts and Sciences in Islamabad and addressed the students regarding child abuse and shared suggestions to eradicate it.

On this occasion, some short documentaries were also shown to the student to give them awareness and to take different preventive measures.

Addressing the students, Federal Minister Dr Mazari said that child abuse has rampaged the society and on daily basis, we hear stories of heart wrenching child abuse incidents. “It is a painful fact that we treat this issue as social taboo and we are reluctant to speak about it instead of educating our children. As a result they are not able to understand the sensitivity of this issue,” said the minister.

She stressed the need to make it a shameful act for the culprits which requires exposing them. She said that child abuse could happen anywhere and in majority of cases, close relations are involved. “We need to take this issue seriously which requires us to recognize this issue and the parents should be open with their children while informing them about child abuse and preventive measures.

Federal minister said that Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Child Protection Act already exits to ensure the protection of children. “We are going to establish Child Protection Commission under the umbrella of ICT Act,” she said adding that that besides, legislation and its implementation, awareness is an important element which could be helpful in fighting the child abuse.

Federal minister said that education institutions can play an important role to prevent child abuse and to educate students which would help them to identify the issue and to save themselves at first stage. She stressed that we can use the platform of the schools to give the counselling to our students.

Dr. Shireen Mazari also talked about teachers’ role. She suggested teachers to aware children about child abuse so that they could be able to identify if someone attempts to abuse them.

She shared that Ministry of Human Rights is running its Child Protection centre which provides the facilities of free education, counselling and free medical treatment to the children. In addition, Ministry of human rights has established helpline 1099 to report issues related to human rights abuses including the child abuse.

In the end, an interactive question answer session was also conducted in which students asked different relevant questions which were responded by Federal Minister. Principal of ICT, large number of faculty members and students attended the session.",['Myra Imran'],"Islamabad: Ministry of Human Rights has launched an awareness campaign to prevent child abuse on Tuesday.

In a statement here, he said a bill against honour killings had been drafted by the PPP and tabled in the Senate which passed it in March 2015 to eliminate inhuman acts of honour killings. There was no honour in killing a human, he said, adding that all the killings in the name of honour, especially of women, should be declared a heinous and unpardonable crime to save the victims from the horrible custom which had nothing to do with civilization or history. Bilawal said PPP legislators put in hard work in drafting Anti-Honour Killings Bill and got it passed through the Senate.

Delaying the bill for a year was tantamount to promotion of honour killings, he said.

He called upon the political parties and civil society to mount pressure on the quarters concerned to complete the legislation. “This was a dream of my mother Shaheed Benazir Bhutto to provide equal opportunities and protection to women and adoption of bill will be a landmark achievement to realize her dream,” he remarked.

Chairman Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Bilawal Bhutto Zardari demanded that the government should cut petroleum products prices by at least Rs 20 per liter to transfer benefit of the international oil price fall to the people.

In a statement he rejected the meager reduction in PoL prices and said it is fleecing of the consumers in the country despite huge decrease in petroleum products prices in the international market.

The Academy Award voters allegedly snubbed the cast and crew of film Selma after they were seen demanding justice for the killing of Eric Garner.

Selma actor David Oyelowo, who played Martin Luther King Jr, and director Ava DuVernay revealed that they were shown a red flag by the Oscars team after their involvement in the Black Lives Matter protests.



""Six years ago, Selma coincided with Eric Garner being murdered. That was the last time we were in a place of ‘I Can’t Breathe.’ I remember at the premiere of Selma us wearing ‘I Can’t Breathe’ T-shirts in protest,"" Oyelowo told Screen Daily.

He continued, ""Members of the Academy called into the studio and our producers saying, ‘How dare they do that? Why are they stirring shit?’ and ‘We are not going to vote for that film, because we do not think it is their place to be doing that.'""

The critically acclaimed movie had been nominated in the Best Picture category at the 2015 Oscars and won Best Original Song for Common and John Legend's Glory.



However, DuVernay was not awarded Best Director award and Oyelowo was also shut out of the Best Actor category.

""It’s part of why that film didn’t get everything that people think it should’ve got and it birthed #OscarsSoWhite,"" Oyelowo explained. ""They used their privilege to deny a film on the basis of what they valued in the world.”

On Twitter, Oyelowo's claims were seconded by DuVernay, who wrote, ""True story.""

The Academy, in response, said, ""Ava & David, we hear you. Unacceptable. We’re committed to progress.""

https://www.thenews.com.pk/magazine/you/700989-unsafe-at-home,,Unsafe at home,"Stuck in your house for months, with minimal or no outside interaction with other humans except via phone or online. The only people you are spending more time with than ever before is your family. Sounds familiar? For some, it may even sound comforting, as home is where one feels safest. But women who are stuck at home with an abusive family member or partner during the pandemic are not safe at home either.



When it comes to the issues humanity is facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the loudest voices and most glaring headlines are centered on the public health crisis, crumbling economies, and job loss. What is often ignored, and not fully understood, are the implications of this crisis on vulnerable communities; one of these is women, and one of the problems women are facing more than ever during the pandemic is gender-based violence, in their homes or outside.

Pakistan saw its first two confirmed cases of COVID-19 on 26th February, 2020. In a video message in the month of April, the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had warned the world of a ‘horrifying global surge’ in domestic violence during the coronavirus pandemic, saying that “We know lockdowns and quarantines are essential to suppressing Covid-19. But they can trap women with abusive partners.”

As stated in a policy brief by the Ministry for Human Rights, Government of Pakistan, titled “Gendered Impact and Implications of COVID-19 in Pakistan,” evidence suggests that epidemics and stresses involved in coping with the epidemics may increase the risk of domestic abuse and other forms of gender-based violence (GBV). Studies have also found that unemployment tends to increase the risk of depression, aggression and episodes of violent behavior in men. “Hence, the country may experience a rise in cases of domestic abuse as a result of COVID-19. Given the current climate of decreased economic activities, financial uncertainties and a situation of lockdown being faced in Pakistan, heightened tensions could translate into women facing more vulnerabilities,” states the brief.

Why is it happening?

The fears have come true. “There is an increasing global evidence that rates of GBV have increased under lockdown,” says Ayesha Khan, author of ‘The Women's Movement in Pakistan: Activism, Islam and Democracy’, adding that women stuck at home with abusers who are getting increasingly frustrated by the impact of the pandemic, both economically and psychologically, have nowhere to go.

The psychological factors seem to be the main reason in this rise. “Men as primary earners in many families are feeling the financial pressure and stress more. For many, social distancing has also meant a drastic change in routine because of limited work and socialising, which causes a build-up of stress. For some, the stress is related to constant fear of exposure to COVID-19 because of work or because men tend to do a lot of outdoor work. Sometimes stress manifests as physical symptoms,” says Clinical Psychologist Dr Asha Bedar who has worked in disaster situations, including the COVID-19 crisis. She shares that she has more men presenting issues such as chest pains, breathing trouble and issues sleeping. Men also tend to externalise a lot of their stress through irritability and aggression which can spill into violence at times. The brunt of this pent up stress is faced by the females in the family, mostly the wife.

As Dr Bedar explains, women during the lockdown have had to disproportionately bear a triple burden of work: increased household work with everyone at home, increased and constant caretaking responsibilities (including coronavirus patients), and home schooling of children (including learning and managing new technology). Working women face an additional juggling responsibilities. “Both physical fatigue and mental stress are being reported more. Constant interaction and demands often mean more conflict at home, and can contribute to more depressive symptoms and anxiety. Many women report being left with no time for themselves. Channels for stress relief through breaks, socialising, and other away-from-home activities like office work, shopping, visiting family, socialising with neighbours, friends, or attending classes etc., have also become limited, increasing their levels of stress and anxiety. Irritability, anger, anxiety and depressive symptoms are all emerging more,” she says. This constant friction between stressed spouses means they have less emotional threshold and patience, especially the men. The result is an increase in domestic violence.

According to a UNODC report titled ‘Gender and Pandemic - URGENT CALL FOR ACTION’ advocacy brief, 90% of women in Pakistan have experienced some form of domestic violence, at the hands of their husbands or families. 47% of married women have experienced sexual abuse, particularly domestic rape. Most common forms of abuse, according to the report, are Shouting or yelling (76%), Slapping (52%), Threatening (49%), Pushing (47%), Punching (40%), and Kicking (40%).

“Most Pakistanis have been hit hard socially and economically by the pandemic, but the impact has been different on women and children who have been historically marginalised and prone to be victims of aggression. Covid-19 and its consequences have placed the already vulnerable women in a graver situation due to the triggers for abuse induced by the stress and financial problems coupled with confinement in the home caused by lockdowns,” says Fauzia Viqar, Chief Executive of Rah Centre for Management and Development, a rights advocacy organisation. She confirms that domestic violence has increased and is being reported in larger numbers across the world, including Pakistan. According to her, the recent numbers shared by the helpline of Ministry of Human Rights prove a rise in domestic violence since the lockdowns in Pakistan.

When asked about the reasons leading to this surge, Dr Tabinda Sarosh, Pathfinder’s country director in Pakistan, says that it is due to “lack of mobility and isolation at home, widespread unidentified and unrecognised mental issues combined with pre-existing high incidence of VAWG (violence against women and girls). Global data shows that incidence of DV and VAWG always rises in crises situations and often goes unreported.”

The broader description of violence, according to Dr Shama Dossa, a community development practitioner, researcher and academic, includes psychological violence and deprivation. “The impact of job loss and lack of mobility is more on women. Women are more burdened with household work during the pandemic. The lesser educated the perpetrator, the more the violence,” she says.

According to a UNODC report titled ‘Gender and Pandemic - URGENT CALL FOR ACTION’ advocacy brief, 90% of women in Pakistan have experienced some form of domestic violence, at the hands of their husbands or families. 47% of married women have experienced sexual abuse, particularly domestic rape.

The reporting of DV in Pakistan is not easy because of multiple factors, and women are scared to report due to social taboo. According to the aforementioned UNODC report, only 0.4% of women take their cases to courts. 50% of women who experience domestic violence do not respond in any way and suffer silently. Usually domestic violence is underreported; women stay in abusive and violent marriages till the stage comes when divorce becomes inevitable.

“Generally, help-seeking behaviour is missing. Anecdotally, police officers say that they succeed in convincing the woman to make up and go back home to the husband without registering an FIR,” says Dr Dossa, adding that the reporting process should be set up in a way that women feel more comfortable to report. A big consideration is that if a woman leaves her house after suffering from DV, where is she to go? “In the province of Sindh, there are some functional safe houses at the district level where complainant can stay for a few days.”

Working towards a solution

Experts feel that while the situation is difficult, the way forward for mitigating domestic violence, particularly in the pandemic, requires multi-pronged approaches.

“Domestic violence can be addressed at different levels, such as raising awareness among women and young people, and providing info on coping and safety, as well as setting up and disseminating info on professional crisis helplines with trained counsellors and lawyers. Also to be included in the strategy should be developing SOPs for the police for handling DV especially during COVID-19, setting up safe (including COVID-19 safe) spaces for women and children, strong support from the Government on a no-tolerance approach for violence, creating awareness on anger and stress management for men, and legal awareness,” suggests Dr Bedar.

The support needed is not just logistic and legal, but also emotional, and all these aspects need consideration. Ayesha Khan shares that in Pakistan, civil society groups have helped to set up new helplines to support women needing help from abusive partners, and cites examples. “Rozan has set up a dedicated national helpline under COVID-19 which gives psycho-social support. ShirkatGah is helping the Sindh Commission on the Status of Women prepare a gender response to Covid-19 pandemic, in which GBV and DV are key areas of concern.”

Dr Dossa is of the opinion that the answer lies in a multi-sectoral collaboration which is needed to counter the menace of DV and GBV, which means that the police, the social welfare department, the women’s development department, the population planning department, all work in consortium. As the main systems provider is the Government, this is what is needed.

The aforementioned policy brief informs us that Pakistan’s Federal Ministry of Human Rights has taken an affirmative step through issuing a COVID-19 Alert that provides a helpline 1099 and a WhatsApp number 0333 908 5709 to report cases of domestic violence during the lockdown.

Dr Sarosh feels that healthcare providers like Lady Health Workers (LHWs) or Lady Health Visitors (LHVs) can also be part of the solution “Under ‘NayaQadam’, for the first time in Pakistan, healthcare providers trained on Family Planning are now being trained on GBV services to become first point contacts for the survivors. This would allow women to seek survivor-centred services in full confidential and private settings, receive basic aid, and high-quality referrals to shelter homes, security services, legal recourses, and of course health responses.” NayaQadam is a project led by Pathfinder International with five partners aimed at high-quality FP programming. While this is a feasible solution, the safety of female healthcare providers is also a matter of concern, more so during the pandemic - safety against any kind of violence and exposure to the coronavirus is something that would need to be looked at carefully when they are out in the field or working from makeshift clinics in their homes.

Women have been excluded from most decision making forums on COVID-19, as well as response and relief related groups. According to Fauzia Viqar, National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) and other high level platforms are cases in point. Absence of the female voice in decision-making for meeting the challenges posed by the pandemic marginalises issues of women, including increase in their care giving role, DV and issues of access to information among others. She adds that COVID-induced restrictions on OPDs and transportation have increased women's challenges, especially of reproductive health, which is already low in priority. “We need to ensure there is no disruption in services to victims of domestic violence such as helplines, shelters and OPDs,” concludes Viqar.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/195270-Pakistans-first-Violence-Against-Women-Center-inaugurated-in-Multan,,Pakistan’s first ‘Violence Against Women Center’ inaugurated in Multan,"MULTAN: Pakistan’s first most advanced, computerized and completely female-run Violence Against Women Center (VAWC) has been established in Multan as part of the Punjab Protection of Women Against Violence (PPWAV) Act enacted in Punjab Assembly in early 2016. The Punjab Chief Minister Mian Shahbaz Sharif has inaugurated the newly-built center to protect women’s rights.

The models of such centers are available in United States, United Kingdom, Greece and some European countries under the title of Women’s Crisis Center. The University of Chicago Law School’s International Human Rights Law Clinic has helped to prepare the first draft of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Women Protection Act, officials say.

“The PPWAV Act and the establishment of the VAWC aim to protect women from physical, emotional and psychological abuse, and promote gender equality. A shelter home will be constructed adjoining the Multan VAWC. Three new centers will be established at the end of the current fiscal year. One of the centers is set to be established in Lahore”, officials say.

The Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) has developed a complaint management system, database to assist the center. The system enable to record all complaints and automating the process of providing information and receiving relevant assistance from the concerned departments including the Police, Forensics, Medico-Legal, Law, Social Welfare and Prosecution. All the data from VAWC will be maintained at the PITB data center in Lahore.



Over 552 women violence incidents have been reported in a report compiled by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan Special Task Force Multan during 12 months of year 2016. The report compiles violence incidents take place in eleven districts of southern Punjab in Multan, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Divisions.

Rights activists expect a change after the establishment of Violence Against Women Center in Multan, which will be the nucleus against women violence.

“Now the situation has changed compared to the past when women go to the police station they are told to go back to their home and accept the violence in the absence of law on violence against women”, Shaista Bokhari says. She is unofficial member of VAWC Multan district Women Protection Committee and the Executive Director of Women’s Rights Association.



The HRCP has reported 91 women killed in the name of honor from January to December 2016. The numbers of 57 women killed on different reasons. 480 women sexually assaulted and 535 women kidnapped. 184 women committed suicide due to domestic reasons and 43 women victimized in acid throwing incidents.

“The Punjab DIG Investigation Branch report in 2013 says at least 6 women are murdered or attempted to be murdered, 8 raped, 11 battered and assaulted, and 32 women are abducted in the province on a daily basis, while the conviction rate ranges from only 1pc to 2.5pc”, police officials observe.

Multan City Police Officer Ehsan Younis says staff including women police posted at VAWC has been equipped with gender sensitivity and initial software trainings including real time key-stroke monitoring software integrates different sections at VAWC.

“The center aims at improving the criminal justice system in the country. The center is also responsible for collection of forensic and other evidence, besides offering mental health and counseling services, and post-trauma rehabilitation under one roof, to increase complainants’ access to justice”, CPO Ehsan Younis says.

The prime objective of the VAWC is streamlining speedy justice delivery process for women and all services to women including First Aid, FIR lodging, prosecution, medical examination, forensics, post-trauma rehabilitation and shelter home for female victims have been provided under one single roof. Free legal services have also been provided to victims, Shaista Bokhari says.

“It is a good initative by the government but it needs more autonomy and authority of District Women Protection Committee members. The role of DWPC members is not clear in Women Protection Act. All powers circle around Deputy Commissioner”, HRCP Coordinator Faisal Tangwani says.

The VAWC system also includes measures to prevent data forgery and tampering; there will be an activity, and time log section that will note down the IP address, username and time at which the existing information was changed and or when new information was added.

“The Violence Against Women Centers should free from bureaucratic red tape to achieve desired goals. The journalists should be given representation in VAWC committees to get up-to-date information on occurrence of violence incidents and highlighting those cases in press and media”, SPO Multan Regional Head Jam Jamshid says.



Police have key role in providing speedy justice to violence victim females. The Punjab police have recruited separate female staff and the post of DIG Gender Crimes has been newly created. A female SP will also be placed in each VAWC. The department is launching a toll-free helpline to receive complaints from distressed women and introducing GPS ankle monitors to enforce protection orders.

“We have 28 members ladies police force including two inspectors, two ASIs, three Head Constables and 21 ladies constables and they are fully vigilant and active”, VAWC supervisory officer DSP Shahida Nasreen says. .



Two female prosecutors have been hired to represent the women at the VAWC and there will be a forensics expert on ground at the center as well. The expert will be present at crime scenes in order to collect evidence based on standard guidelines so that it is preserved. The involvement of forensics at a sub-divisional level is a big improvement to the existing system which has been criticized for being inefficient in the timely acquisition and preservation of evidence.

“We deal both violence cases registered with respective police stations and complaints directly receive at VAQC Women Police Station. The newly established VAWC is fully relief oriented and women can confidently explain their miseries. Two ladies prosecutors have been appointed at VAWC and soon a judge would be appointed for court trials. The prosecution links up through internet with the rest of police network”, VAWC Women police station incharge inspector Nimreen Munir says.



Shaista Bokhari says there is a dire need to spread awareness about the rights of women.

“It is a pity that laws in favor of women are passed in the parliament but common women were unaware of these laws and thus could not initiate legal proceedings against the inhumane torture and violence inflicted upon them.



She observes it is essential for sustainable development that the women should be onboard and they must enjoy the same opportunities, outcomes, rights and obligations in all spheres of life. They must have ability to control their own lives according to their own wishes. But in South Punjab the women are living in miserable conditions and they are visible marginalized group.",[],"MULTAN: Pakistan’s first most advanced, computerized and completely female-run Violence Against Women Center (VAWC) has been established in Multan as part of the Punjab Protection of Women Against Violence (PPWAV) Act enacted in Punjab Assembly in early 2016.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/168154-Law-on-conversion,,Law on conversion,"A longstanding demand of the Hindu community in Pakistan, which constitutes just over two million people, most of them impoverished peasants living in interior Sindh, has finally been met. Last week, the Sindh Assembly passed the Sindh Criminal Law (Protection of Minorities) Bill 2015, which aims at criminalising forcible conversion, along with a fine to be paid to the victim. Mostly, these conversions are done by forced marriage of young girls – in the process also forcibly converting them. The practice has been common in years, notably in Sindh, and mainly affects Hindus, though Christians have faced the same problem in other parts of the country. In August this year, Hindus across Sindh and also in cities around the world had protested against a powerful cleric in Sindh allegedly engaged in the practice of luring under-age Hindu girls, compelling them to marry and convert their religion. The cleric has vehemently denied this, saying that only ‘mature’ girls came to him. But the outcry from Hindus has continued for years and involves more than simply one religious figure.

The new law was a private bill moved by opposition lawmaker Nand Kumar Goklani of the PML-F. The law essentially says that no religious conversion will be accepted until the person converting has reached the minimum age of 18 years. A process for rescuing children who have been kidnapped, and producing them in court, has also been put in place and if someone is found to have forced a conversion, a life term can be awarded. There is also an additional provision stating that even when an adult declares he or she has converted, they will be permitted 21 days by the court to make an independent decision about their new religion or entering into any marriage. The bill should offer some relief to victims of forced conversions, though of course a lot depends on how well it is implemented. Minority rights activists claim there have been over a thousand forced conversions each year over the last five years. There are no confirmed reports on the precise figure, but however many take place are obviously too many. Any law that can protect minors – mostly young girls – from such a fate and from being held against their will or being married off forcibly and being made to change their religion is to be welcomed. It marks an important effort to safeguard the rights of minorities in the country and perhaps a stepping stone from which we can walk forward towards bigger goals. We hope the country’s other provincial governments look at Sindh’s initiative as an inspiration to make similar laws.",[],"Last week, the Sindh Assembly passed the Sindh Criminal Law (Protection of Minorities) Bill 2015, which aims at criminalising forcible conversion, along with a fine to be paid to the victim.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/671959-four-killed-in-kabul-mosque-blast-govt,,Four killed in Kabul mosque blast: govt,"KABUL: At least four people were killed after a blast ripped through a crowd during Friday prayers at a mosque in Kabul, Afghan officials said, in the latest attack on the city ahead of potential talks with insurgents.

“Based on our initial information, at around noon explosives placed inside the mosque detonated during Friday prayers,” interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said in a message to journalists. A health ministry spokesman also confirmed the toll, saying the prayer leader and three worshippers were killed at the Sher Shah Suri mosque, while several others were wounded. The attack comes a week after an Islamic State-claimed attack killed two people, including a popular prayer leader, at a mosque on the edge of Kabul’s heavily fortified green zone. Afghanistan is juggling multiple crises, with the coronavirus rapidly spreading across the country and continuing violence even as the government and Taliban signal they are getting closer to sitting down for talks.

President Ashraf Ghani vowed Thursday to complete a Taliban prisoner release that is a key condition to the launch of peace talks with the insurgents. “Once the swap is done, the two sides have pledged to begin negotiations that could end nearly 19 years of war.”

Ghani said he would elaborate next steps in the peace process next week and called for a “humanitarian ceasefire” to provide food and medical assistance during the coronavirus crisis. “In terms of reduction of violence, there has been (one) but the casualty figures still average around 60-70 a day. The number of fatalities unfortunately are averaging 30,” he said. Ghani did not say if the casualties were civilians, fighters or a combination. Ghani said women would form an important part of eventual peace talk negotiating teams. Under the US-Taliban deal, American and foreign forces are slated to leave Afghanistan over the coming months.

The Taliban have largely refrained from launching major attacks on Afghan cities since February, when they signed a deal with the US meant to pave the way for peace talks with the Kabul government. A ceasefire during last month’s Eid al Fitr holidays also sparked hopes that the two sides may be getting closer to holding negotiations even as a recent uptick in fighting has tempered expectations.

The ceasefire was just the second observed in the country since the Taliban were toppled by a US invasion in 2001 following the September 11 attacks by Al-Qaeda, whose leader Osama bin Laden was sheltered by the regime.",[],"KABUL: At least four people were killed after a blast ripped through a crowd during Friday prayers at a mosque in Kabul, Afghan officials said, in the latest attack on the city ahead of potential talks with insurgents.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/485720-inefficiency-and-corruption-blotch-police,,Inefficiency and corruption blotch police,"Islamabad : By and large performance of police has touched the most minuscule ebb with hardly any interest being shown by the government or by the department itself to first to arrest the rot and then take steps to revive the actual spirit of policing, a police officer holding a key office in the Punjab, observed on the condition of anonymity.

It may sound harsh and sort of a sweeping statement but unfortunately this is an undeniable fact that the priorities of a vast majority of our ‘Police Service of Pakistan’ (PSP) officers have completely changed from policing to self-projection and money collection by using their office. But majority of the PSP officers are intend to concentrate on professional policing with dignity and honour, the pragmatic officer kept up.

Gone are the days when the corrupt or dishonest police officers used to get immediately spotted and marked and would be described as the ‘black sheep’ of the department by their own brethren in uniform, the officer maintained.

Now are the days that if we find an honest and upright officer, we immediately start eulogizing him with good intention because of their dedication and aim to perform their duties with a noticeable level of honesty and commitment, he said and added “good repute is actually respect from God.”

“Any police command doesn’t carry a ‘magic wand’ that he will wave with a flourish and the things will change. We don’t expect him to turn the Islamabad Police into a model police force in the country over a short period of time,” the officer upheld. “But what pains us to note is that he has yet to take the right steps in the right direction to achieve what he has promised and what he is actually supposed to do as the commander of the police force,” he added.

A few directions he gave to the force only encouraged the corrupt and unscrupulous elements in the force to start abuse their powers with impunity. We have all the reasons to believe that he had issued those directions with all the good will behind those. But unfortunately the result is that the old culture of harassing poor public and extortion by patrolling police officials on the roads and in the streets is creeping back, the officer said.

There are still high hopes pinned on him concerning change in the prevailing police culture, which has crept in the federal territory from Punjab and has become so rotten that to change it has become a slogan for the political parties.

Amidst the prevailing environments, made murkier by the political confusion in the country, the inefficiency and corruption throughout the country, particularly, in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Police Department is going un-noticed.

Simply, because the evils of corruption, nepotism, dishonesty and abuse of power have dug their claws too deep in our society.

With obvious political influence on the department the ‘check and balance system’ for monitoring the performance of officials and officers, have tailed off badly, ultimately, reflecting adversely on the crime control and maintenance of law and order situation in the twin-cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad.

However, at the same time we have seen individuals in the same police department who had refused to budge to the pressure mounted by the politicians and had left highly appreciable impressions by improving the performance, thus winning the hearts and minds of public.

It has been observed that some Station House Officers (SHOs), the Sub-Divisional Police Officers (SDPOs), the Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASPs) and the Superintendent of Police (SPs) are not coming up to the set standards of efficiency in the performances of their duties.

The situation has created a discontented element in the force as they feel that they are not being awarded and rewarded for their good work while looking helplessly at their colleagues with shady and questionable service records being patronized because of political influence and clout they have mustered up.

This is observed that some upright and professional police officers have been side-lined without concrete reasons but the rationale was that they performed their duties in earlier period according to law during the previous long ‘sit-in’. Some victim police officers have posted out of Islamabad while some have joined UN Mission to avoid rage of the rulers.

This is an established fact that the upright, honest and professional officers feel themselves misfit in the police organism for the reason that they remain intolerable for the political robust who are running the faulty system of the law enforcing agency. Because of the political deeds, the government could not introduce the police reforms that were their first main concern and prime intention.

But at the same time it should be realised that any police command doesn’t carry a ‘magic wand’ that he will wave with a flourish and the things will change. We don’t expect him to turn the Islamabad Police into a model police force in the country over a short period of time.

We do realise that such a change cannot be induced overnight or even over a considerable period of time, counting in years. But what we expect is for the police bosses to see the reality and realize how compellingly essential it has become to take the right steps in the right direction, first to arrest the deterioration and then to eventually reach the goal.

But what pains us to note is that he has yet to take the right steps in the right direction to achieve what he has promised and what he is actually supposed to do as the leader of the Islamabad Police force.

At this stage we are in dire need of officers like Zulfiqar Cheema and Nasir Khan Durrani, who never compromised on the principles, astutely confronted the political pressure and brought about a change in the force under their direct control, creating small islands of honesty and integrity wherever they went to serve. But the best contribution they made towards Pakistan Police was that they nurtured and groomed a team of honest, dedicated and upright police officers, some of which are still working somewhere in the country challenging and confronting the prevalent dishonest system.

Now is the time that we need more and more of such officer who wrote history of policing and honesty in the department.

Former Inspector General of Police KP, Nasir Khan Durrani, when contacted by the correspondent for his comments, accepting overall deteriorating situation of the society including the police department, said training and motivation is basic requirement for the young officer. He expressed his sanguinity, saying that the youth of this country is upright, honest and cultured and has capability to put the country on right direction.

Afzal Ali Shigri, author of the police reform, when contacted by this scribe to know, how the police culture could be modified, said, “Yes, a notable number of PSP officers are involved in financial and moral corruption and getting away from professionalism. It is due to deteriorating situation of the society but lack of training is prime reason of the opting wrong track.” He said that weak command was not fulfilling his responsibilities and most important responsibility is to give motivation to the officers of young lot. Peer pressure from the close relative, friends and politicians put them on wrong track.

He admitted that the political intervention is not confined to the Police department all over the country but almost every department has been manipulated by the politicians for their own gains instead of serving the public and the state.",['Shakeel Anjum'],"But majority of the PSP officers are intend to concentrate on professional policing with dignity and honour, the pragmatic officer kept up.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/659101-inspirational-story-of-blind-pakistani-girl-whos-stormed-to-britains-got-talent,,Inspirational story of blind British Pakistani girl who's stormed to Britain's Got Talent,"LONDON: A 14-year-old British Pakistani girl who lost sight at the age of 10 has become a huge sensation in ITV's famous hit show - Britain's Got Talent – hoping to make it to the final of the popular show.

Sirine Jahnagir, who is the only contestant of Pakistani origin on the hit show, is the granddaughter of Sahibzada Jahangir, who presently serves as Prime Minister Imran Khan’s spokesperson on Trade & Investment in UK & Europe. Fauzia Kasuri is Sirin’s aunt and the late pop and nasheed singer Junaid Jamshed was her uncle.

Sirine has become an instant hit after outperforming her rivals through her amazing music performances – and winning approval from judges Simon Cowell, Alesha Dixon, Amanda Holden and David Walliams.

Sirine was born in 2005 in London. Until the age of five, she excelled in everything including sports, with dancing being her favourite pastime. Her family discovered when Sirine was five years old that she had lost her vision totally in one eye and although the other eye was perfect, there was a danger it may deteriorate.

Over time, the worst fears of the family were realised as Sirine lost vision slowly in her remaining good eye until the age of 10 when she lost it all.

A family friend told The News and Geo that those 5 years were very traumatic for Sirine as she could not do many things and slowly she learnt Braille and started to read books again. Her parents and family were supportive throughout this time and helped Sirine, who wanted to make it big in the world.

Her parents had to move to Mill Hill, in North London, when she reached the age of 12, as there were no secondary schools in central London that could cater to her special needs. In her new school, Sirine had access to expertise that helped her learn other skills. It was around this time that she delved into music. She learnt how to play the piano by herself and started singing and writing music.

Sirine has never looked back and her passion took her, after a gruelling process of selection, to Britain's Got Talent.

On Saturday, she will appear in the audition stages of Britain's Got Talent on ITV.

When contacted by The News and Geo, Sahibzada Jahangir confirmed that Sirine would be appearing before the celebrity panel.

He said: “We are all very proud of Sirine. She is hard-working, lovely and passionate. When there is a disability in someone, Allah gifts that person with some other exceptional talent. Sirine’s parents have been exceptional in bringing her up and giving her everything she needed. She does charity work and helps others. She wants to thank Allah for what she has and for the blessings in her life.”

Kafeel Jahangir, Sirine's father, told The News and Geo that Sirine taught herself how to write, compose and play music.

“We are all very proud of Sirine. Music is her passion and Britain will give her the right platform to share her music with others. She is very excited. She did the auditions by herself for BGT. One day she told me to come along with her. I went along and was shocked that she was performing before 3,000 people. She taught herself how to play music.”

Kafeel said that during his trips to the UK, the late Junaid Jamshed used to sing with Sirine and teach her about music.

Sirine uses music and her story to inspire other people with disabilities. Every Monday she goes to a school and teaches a young 6-year-old boy who has the same condition as her and she teaches him Braille and gives him confidence in seeing the future and believing he can do anything as well.",[],"LONDON: A 14-year-old British Pakistani girl who lost sight at the age of 10 has become a huge sensation in ITV's famous hit show - Britain's Got Talent – hoping to make it to the final of the popular show.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/322789-beatings-rape-and-non-stop-work,,"Beatings, rape and non-stop work","UK women enslaved into forced marriages

By Monitoring desk

Betrayed by her own family, isolated from the outside world and raped daily by her violent husband, one desperate teenager turned to a confidential helpline.

The 17-year-old from the north of England first met her abusive partner the day before she was forced to marry the middle-aged man in Britain. She was 16 at the time, but her road to forced marriage in the UK began years earlier.

As an infant she was taken to Somalia, where she underwent the most extreme form of female genital mutilation, without any pain relief. Disclosing her secret more than a decade later to a call handler at a forced marriage charity, she confided that on her wedding night, her “husband” cut her open with a knife so he could consummate their marriage.

The vulnerable teenager is among thousands of forced marriage victims believed to be living as modern-day slaves in Britain – and who experts say should be given increased protection through the use of human trafficking laws.

In a call last year she told the human rights charity Karma Nirvana that she was being kept in the house and beaten and raped by her husband. When she became pregnant she thought she would be left alone, but the abuse continued.

Alex, a senior call handler who spoke to the girl, said: “After the initial call she rang back to say she had undergone FGM again, this time under the instructions of her husband. She was distressed and said she would be prevented from seeing health workers during her pregnancy in case the FGM was detected.”

She was talked through her options but later made one last call to say things had got worse and she could see no way out. Alex said: “Tragically, we never heard from her again. It’s probably the most heartbreaking case I’ve dealt with.”

In 2017 the charity fielded more than 700 calls from under-18s. Among other callers was a 22-year-old British woman seeking advice after a forced marriage in Pakistan. Her parents were coercing her to work six days a week so her earnings would reach the required threshold to sponsor her foreign spouse to come to the UK.

A 55-year-old woman travelled to the UK from Pakistan on a visit visa before being forced to marry her British employer. She said he treated her like a slave, making her work non-stop and tracking her down when she tried to flee.

He extended the abuse to her daughters in Pakistan by ordering members

of the community to target them. Specialist workers were able to advocate on her behalf and she has since been granted refugee status.

Ameera Jamil, a senior call handler, said: “Victims are reluctant to go to police for fear they won’t be believed. Where they come from such abuse might be tolerated or if the victim is a man they would be ridiculed.

More than 3,500 reports of forced marriage were made to police over a three-year period, a Guardian investigation has found, as charities warned that there were thousands more victims living in conditions of modern slavery in homes across the UK.

Data shared exclusively with the Guardian revealed 3,546 reports between 2014 and 2016. But experts warn that the figures, collected by the Iranian and Kurdish Women’s Rights Organisation under the Freedom of Information Act, are just the tip of the iceberg.

Over the same three-year period one national helpline run by another NGO received 22,030 calls from individuals or agencies concerned about a forced marriage. In 2017 the NGO Karma Nirvana received a further 8,870 calls, including more than 200 from or about children under 15, and gave advice regarding eight new clients under 10.The new figures reveal the shocking extent of forced marriage in Britain – a crime experts say should be investigated and prosecuted as a form of modern slavery.",[],"She was 16 at the time, but her road to forced marriage in the UK began years earlier.

According to a police report on the incident, Abid Malhi and his accomplice Shafqat Ali had allegedly raped her before depriving her of money and other valuables.

Shafqat Ali, who is also currently on judicial remand, was arrested a few days after the incident but Abid Malhi had continued to dodge the authorities before he was nabbed from Manga Mandi, following 33 days of a manhunt by the Punjab police.

‘Modern technology used to arrest Abid’

On Monday, Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Punjab Inam Ghani said that a special investigation team led by DIG Investigation Lahore Shehzada Sultan, through the use of modern technology and scientific approach, arrested the prime suspect of the Lahore-Sialkot motorway gang rape case.

The IGP said that a special investigation team had submitted a daily report on a regular basis to Chief Minister Usman Buzdar and IGP Office about the efforts and steps taken for the arrest.

How Abid evaded arrest

During the interrogation, Abid Malhi revealed the details of how he had managed to hide from the law for almost a month before falling into a trap laid out by the police.

According to sources, Malhi revealed to the police that he spent a month travelling through various cities in Punjab by using public transport and wearing a mask over his face.

The motorway rape prime suspect revealed that he had first fled to Nankana Sahib after allegedly raping the woman while his accomplice, Shafqat, escaped to Dialpur.

With the police on his trail, Malhi escaped from Nankana Sahib and went to Bahawalpur, where he managed to evade the police and avoid detection by wearing a mask.

""I travelled through various cities on public transport,"" sources quoted the suspect as saying, adding that he ultimately got caught after he ran out of money and was forced to contact his wife.

""Me, Shafqat and Bala Mistri went [to the highway] to commit robberies near Karol village,"" he said, according to sources. ""Mistri did not proceed with us. However, Shafqat and I went towards the jungle in Karol.""

Malhi disclosed that he and Shafqat robbed two to three truck drivers near Karol village near the motorway before they sexually assaulted the woman.

He said that the car's flashing indicators caught his attention and upon seeing a woman inside, Malhi told her to come out. Confirming initial reports of the crime that had been reported in media, he said that when the woman refused to oblige, he broke the vehicle's window and dragged her outside.

""After robbing the woman of her watch, jewellery, and money, we told her to go down the motorway,"" he said, according to sources. ""When the woman refused to do so, we took her children off the motorway, and the woman followed to protect them.""

Malhi then revealed that the suspects gang-raped the woman when she came down the motorway to protect her children.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/518246-fact-check-top-nigerian-politician-attacked-in-germany-for-seeking-medical-care,,Fact-check: Top Nigerian politician attacked in Germany for seeking medical care?,"Posts circulating on Facebook and WhatsApp claim to show protesters attacking a senior Nigerian politician while he was seeking medical care in Germany. The videos have been viewed tens of thousands of times in Africa, reflecting anger over accusations that wealthy politicians use state-of-the-art medical facilities abroad while failing to invest in healthcare at home. But the politician seen in the video wasn’t attacked over medical care at all. Senator Ike Ekweremadu was attacked at a German conference centre, not a hospital. A Nigerian separatist group has claimed responsibility for the August 17 attack, saying it was retaliation for his support for a crackdown at home.



Posts accompanying the video of a man being pelted with eggs and dragged out of a building by an angry crowd variously claim it shows Nigeria’s “vice president” or “vice president of the Senate” getting attacked over medical treatment.

“Nigerian Vice President went to Germany for treatment, his countrymen block him from entering the hospital asking him to return home and use the same facilities as other Nigerians. If he doesn’t like them, they’ve asked him to use the same taxpayer funds they steal and upgrade the facilities for all at home,” said one post doing the rounds on WhatsApp in Nigeria and Kenya.

A similar video, archived here, has been seen more than 38,000 times on Facebook since it was shared by a Kenyan account on August 22.

Its caption said: “Arrived in Germany for medical care, the vice president of the Senate of Nigeria is beaten by his compatriots who ask him to return to the country. You want better care !!! We too want some. Build 5-star hospitals to benefit everyone. You are not asked to do it from your pocket, full of money from the people that you steal from us every day. Do it with the budgeted money. Otherwise we die together.”

The same video was posted with a French caption by a Facebook user in Burkina Faso, similarly claiming to show the vice-president of the Nigerian senate being attacked by his countrymen for seeking medical care in Germany.

This politician is not Nigeria’s vice-president, and he was not attacked over medical care

The man being assaulted in the video is indeed a Nigerian politician -- Senator Ike Ekweremadu, who currently represents Enugu state. He served as the deputy senate president until June 2019, but he is neither the current vice president of the Nigerian senate nor the vice president of the country as the posts claim.

The videos show several people manhandling Ekweremadu as he attended a conference for the Nigerian diaspora in southern Germany on August 17. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) group, which is pushing for the succession of Nigeria’s southeastern regions, claimed responsibility for the incident. IPOB, which is banned in Nigeria, said its members targeted Ekweremadu over his support for a government crackdown on its activists.



The attack took place outside a conference centre in the southern city of Nuremberg, where Ndi-Igbo Germany, a Nigerian diaspora cultural association, had organised a day of celebration of Igbo culture. Ekweremadu was listed as a guest of honour on the event invitation. Ndi-Igbo Germany later apologised to the senator for the attack:



The incident was widely reported by the Nigerian media, and there is no record of Ekweremadu being attacked for seeking medical care abroad. We fact-checked another claim relating to the incident here.

Ekweremadu returned to Nigeria less than 48 hours later and has said he is “hale and hearty”.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/738933-bd-high-court-questions-ban-on-marital-rape-prosecutions,,BD high court questions ban on marital rape prosecutions,"DHAKA: Bangladesh’s High Court has questioned a ban on marital rape prosecutions after women’s rights groups argued it was discriminatory to stop alleged rapists from being charged if they are married to their victims, activists said on Tuesday. The court’s decision to seek an explanation from the government on the issue comes amid growing concern about sexual violence in Bangladesh, where the penal code and domestic abuse laws do not contemplate marital rape as a crime, a British wire service reported. Campaigners, who say current legislation discriminates against married women and girls, welcomed the court’s ruling. “We think this is very much a step in the right direction,” said Sara Hossain, from the Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust, one of several rights groups that filed a writ petition with the High Court. “We told the court that Pakistan, Nepal and India have changed their laws. The law for us also has to be in accordance with equality,” she said, adding that the group would seek a final ruling from the court after the government responds. The Deputy Attorney General representing the government at the hearing declined to comment on the court’s request, but confirmed that it had been issued on Tuesday. Last month, the government changed the law to expand the use of the death penalty in rape cases following protests triggered by an online video showing a group of men sexually assaulting a woman. Women’s rights advocates said the tougher penalties would not be enough to tackle increasing rape cases, demanding far-reaching reform of the legal system and more education to bring about real change. Nearly 1,000 sexual crimes were reported between January and September, including more than 200 gang rapes, according to human rights group Ain-o- Salish Kendra. A national survey by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics in 2015 found that at least 27% of the 20,000 married women surveyed had experienced sexual violence by their husbands.",['News Report'],"DHAKA: Bangladesh’s High Court has questioned a ban on marital rape prosecutions after women’s rights groups argued it was discriminatory to stop alleged rapists from being charged if they are married to their victims, activists said on Tuesday.

MULTAN: Senior politician Makhdoom Javed Hashmi has said the National Accountability Bureau is a biased institution as it has allegedly given a safe exit to former president (Gen) Pervez Musharraf without investigating him that how he established bungalows in the US, the UAE and London.

Addressing a press conference at his residence here on Thursday, he demanded the government made amendments to the NAB laws to convict the guilty people instead of targeting political rivals and blackmailing them for changing loyalties. He said that no society could survive without accountability and the NAB laws needed amendments for free, fair and unbiased accountability.

Hashmi alleged that Musharraf had created the NAB to blackmail politicians to join the PML-Q.

He claimed that PTI chairman Imran Khan was close to Musharraf.

Hashmi said that not a single Pakistani doctor gave his expert opinion on Musharraf's treatment abroad. He said that political parties and the government were not responsible for Musharraf’s exit. He said that the government should give a free hand to Musharraf in politics because he would fail. Hashmi said that he was ready to face Musharraf if he contested elections from Islamabad.

He said that he knew the NAB chairman for the last 40 years and he was a noble man. He alleged that the generals defaced constitution and it was not implemented in its true spirit.

On the other hand, the civilian rulers sacrificed their lives to protect the constitution, he said, adding that PPP founder Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was hanged for giving the constitution.

He said that he was a well wisher of the army. Hashmi said: “Gen Mehmood hands up the then prime minister Nawaz Sharif with his revolver and sought his resignation at gunpoint, but Nawaz refused and resisted.”

He said that the MQM and the PPP were punished for not taking part in the PTI's Islamabad sit-in. To a question, Hashmi said that he was not going to join the political party of Mustafa Kamal.",[],"He said that no society could survive without accountability and the NAB laws needed amendments for free, fair and unbiased accountability.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/306016-more-turkish-women-run-for-parliament,,More Turkish women run for parliament,"Women are likely to increase their share of parliamentary seats in Turkey’s elections on Sunday, but the gender gap remains wide as the EU-hopeful country struggles to overcome patriarchal traditions.

“Men want to play politics with men. Women annoy them in the political arena, which they consider as their own domain,” said Ezgi Kocak from the KA-DER association, which supports women in politics.

The number of women lawmakers almost doubled in the 2007 elections, reaching 9.1 per cent, or 50 of the 550 seats.

That figure could increase to 15 per cent in the upcoming polls, Kocak said, as “lobbying for women candidates has been effective in recent years,” leading parties to place them higher on their candidates’ lists. “But this is far from enough,” she added, calling for full gender equality in parliament.

The situation is even worse in local administrations: women mayors head only about four per cent of 2,950 municipalites across Turkey.

Improving women’s social status however did not figure high in campaigning ahead of the election, in which the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), the moderate offshoot of a banned Islamist movement, is seeking a straight third term in office.

The main opposition, the secular Republican People’s Party (CHP), argues it has opened a wider room for female contenders, pointing at 99 women on its list for the total of 550 parliamentary seats, compared to 78 on the AKP list. Nevertheless, in 27 of the 81 provinces, no women candidates figure are in the running.

The country’s founding father Mustafa Kemal Ataturk gave women full voting rights as early as 1934, years ahead of some members of the European Union, which Turkey is seeking to join.

But although many are today emancipated in the urbanized west, in vast rural regions where patriarchal traditions continue to grip society, women are denied education and often treated like property.

In power since

2002, the AKP has come under fire for raising the profile of Islam in daily life and impeding the improvement for women.

Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan attracted the ire of female activists last year when he said that “men and women cannot be equal” but only “complementary to each other.” He has also repeatedly urged couples to have at least three children, a proposal that women’s groups see as the reflecting a desire to keep women in the home.

The AKP denies the charges, pointing at legal amendments it has undertaken to stamp out gender discrimination.

The reforms include an overhaul of the penal code in 2004, which introduced heavier sentences for perpetrators crimes in which women are murdered for behaviour that male relatives consider a stain on their honour—so-called “honor killings”.

Women activists however insist that cases of domestic abuse against women have increased under the AKP.

In February and March, 52 women were killed by men, according to a tally by BIAnet, a news site focusing on human rights abuses. The figure was at least 217 for last year, and 27 per cent of them were killed after asking for a divorce.

“The laws have been reformed, but we must change the attitudes and implement the laws in everyday life,” said lawyer Sema Kendirci from the Woomen’s Union association.“Despite progress, Turkey is now entrapped in a system that favours men, both in professional life and in politics,” Kendirci said.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/676537-new-york-city-to-remove-roosevelt-statue-over-racism-concerns,,New York City to remove Roosevelt statue over racism concerns,"NEW YORK: New York City announced Sunday it would remove a statue of former US President Theodore Roosevelt long criticized as a racist and colonialist symbol, but the move drew criticism from Donald Trump.

The decision comes with the United States gripped by widespread protests against racial inequality -- sparked by the killing in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man -- with demonstrators toppling a number of statues of figures with racist legacies.

The bronze sculpture of Roosevelt, which has been at the entrance of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) for 80 years, depicts the former leader on horseback towering over a black man and a Native American man -- who are both on foot. Citing the ongoing movement for racial justice, the museum said: ""We also have watched as the attention of the world and the country has increasingly turned to statues and monuments as powerful and hurtful symbols of systemic racism.""

The Roosevelt statue, it added, ""has long been controversial because of the hierarchical composition that places one figure on horseback and the others walking alongside, and many of us find its depictions of the Native American and African figures and their placement in the monument racist.""

New York City authorities agreed to the museum´s request to remove the statue, ""It explicitly depicts Black and Indigenous people as subjugated and racially inferior,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. ""The City supports the Museum´s request. It is the right decision and the right time to remove this problematic statue.""

Theodore Roosevelt became the 26th US president at the beginning of the 20th century, and while he was celebrated as a conservationist and progressive at the time, he also held racist views towards black and Native American people, according to the AMNH website.

A Roosevelt family member released a statement approving the removal. ""The world does not need statues, relics of another age, that reflect neither the values of the person they intend to honor nor the values of equality and justice,"" said Theodore Roosevelt IV, aged 77, a great-grandson.

""The composition of the Equestrian Statue does not reflect Theodore Roosevelt´s legacy. It is time to move the statue and move forward."" But President Donald Trump criticized the decision to remove the statue, tweeting: ""Ridiculous, don´t do it!"" Trump had called on police to arrest demonstrators who took down a statue of Confederate general Albert Pike in Washington DC on Friday.

The protests against racial inequality and police brutality have seen the toppling or removal of statues depicting Confederate generals, colonial figures and slave traders in the United States, Britain and New Zealand. The figures targeted by protesters have included Christopher Columbus and British colonialist Cecil Rhodes.",[],"NEW YORK: New York City announced Sunday it would remove a statue of former US President Theodore Roosevelt long criticized as a racist and colonialist symbol, but the move drew criticism from Donald Trump.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/155575-Punishment-despite-compromise-in-honour-killing-cases,,Punishment despite compromise in honour killing cases,"Parliament approves two bills

ISLAMABAD: The joint sitting of both the houses of parliament on Thursday gave approval to women protection bills aimed at increased punishment for people involved in honour killings and making DNA tests mandatory in the rape cases.

Both the bills — the Anti-Honour Killings Laws (Criminal Laws Amendment) Bill, 2016 and Anti-Rape Laws (Criminal Laws Amendment) Bill, 2016 — were moved by Senator Farhatullah Babar in the joint sitting of both the houses of parliament.

One bill relates to amending the honour killing law seeking to curb murders in the name of honour and the other relates to anti-rape laws aimed at punishing rapists by use of modern technology of DNA testing in investigating rape cases.

Both the bills, initially moved by former PPP senator Sughra Imam, were passed unanimously by the Senate sometime back and subsequently moved in the joint sitting of parliament by Farhatullah Babar on the expiry of Sughra Imam’s term in the Senate.

These bills were approved by the parliamentary special committee on bills headed by Law Minister Zahid Hamid that comprised members from both the houses of parliament in July this year.

Under the anti-honour killing bill, the clause giving pardon by family members to the person who kills in the name of honour is to be removed.

Under the Anti-Rape Laws (Criminal Laws Amendment) Bill, 2014, whoever prints or publishes the name or any matter which may make known the identity of any person against whom an offence under Section 376 is alleged or found to have been committed (hereafter in this section referred to as the victim) shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine. The anti-rape bill seeks to make a DNA test compulsory as part of the procedure and investigation in all rape cases.

Similarly, for the first time, anyone hampering the investigation into a rape case will be sentenced to three years imprisonment. Besides, rape of minors, as well as mentally and physically challenged, would become punishable by death. The trial of rape cases would be binding to be completed in three months while the time for appeal in such cases would be four months.

The legislation on honour killings has introduced strict punishment for the convicts making it tougher than the ordinary murder cases. Under the new law, the convict in honour killing cases will have to face life imprisonment even if the relatives of the victims reach an agreement with the convict and pardon him or her. Under the existing law, a murderer can be released after the legal heirs pardon him and on honour killings recommends 25 years imprisonment even if the heirs of the victim pardon the convict.

Moving the bill in the House, Farhatullah Babar said the bill is aimed at preventing killing of women in the name of honour. The religious parties had objected to the bill with an argument to do away with the compoundable clause. But, Farhatullah Babar had argued that Islam never allows killing of anyone with ulterior motives. He said issue of compoundability was not an issue of ideology rather it was a political issue. “The proposed law would be a step forward to stop honour killings as there were shortcomings in the present law,” he added.

Babar said the Anti-Honour Killing Bill was passed by the Senate Committee in 2014 when it was headed by the JUI-F senator. “Subsequently it was passed by the 104-member Senate by consensus including the religious parties,” he added.

He said that under the anti-terror laws, murder was not compoundable and Qisas and Diyat did not apply. Similarly, he said Women Protection Act of 2004 was also excluded from compoundability murders. He said that opposition to exclude from Qisas and Diyat law and to make non-compoundable murders in the name of honour was motivated by politics and not religion. He said it is being opposed simply because it is viewed as women related bill and some of us do not have empathy towards women in the country. “This is not only women related but it also relates to men,” he said.","['Asim Yasin', 'Muhammad Anis']","Under the anti-honour killing bill, the clause giving pardon by family members to the person who kills in the name of honour is to be removed.
The legislation on honour killings has introduced strict punishment for the convicts making it tougher than the ordinary murder cases.
Under the new law, the convict in honour killing cases will have to face life imprisonment even if the relatives of the victims reach an agreement with the convict and pardon him or her.
“The proposed law would be a step forward to stop honour killings as there were shortcomings in the present law,” he added.
Babar said the Anti-Honour Killing Bill was passed by the Senate Committee in 2014 when it was headed by the JUI-F senator.","['bills', 'despite', 'parliament', 'compromise', 'punishment', 'cases', 'bill', 'laws', 'rape', 'killings', 'women', 'honour', 'killing', 'law']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/700X390_thenews.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'Punishment despite compromise in honour killing cases | Top Story | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'Parliament approves two bills\r\n\r\nISLAMABAD: The joint sitting of both the houses of parliament on Thursday gave approval to women protection bills aimed at increased punishment for people involved...', 'keywords': 'punishment,compromise,honour,killing,cases', 'fb': {'app_id': 650123461797330}, 'og': {'title': 'Punishment despite compromise in honour killing cases', 'image': {'identifier': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'secure_url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'width': 390}, 'description': 'Parliament approves two bills\r\n\r\nISLAMABAD: The joint sitting of both the houses of parliament on Thursday gave approval to women protection bills aimed at increased punishment for people involved...', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/155575-Punishment-despite-compromise-in-honour-killing-cases', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@thenews_intl', 'creator': '@AYAsim Yasin  & MAMuhammad Anis', 'title': 'Punishment despite compromise in honour killing cases', 'description': 'Parliament approves two bills\r\n\r\nISLAMABAD: The joint sitting of both the houses of parliament on Thursday gave approval to women protection bills aimed at increased punishment for people involved...', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg?t=015953'}, 'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style': 'black-translucent', 'apple-mobile-web-app-title': 'The News International', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#333333', 'theme-color': '#000000'})",[],news

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/614196-supreme-court-directs-commissioner-to-furnish-report-on-rusticated-boy,,Supreme Court directs commissioner to furnish report on rusticated boy,"LAHORE: The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Friday directed the Lahore commissioner to furnish a report regarding the mental and physical health of a 17-year-old boy who was rusticated by the Aitchison College.

Former chief justice of Pakistan had taken up the matter after the boy, Naveed Munir, had filed an application to the human rights cell of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

A three-member bench headed by Chief Justice Ch Gulzar Ahmed and comprising Justice Umar Ata Bandial and Justice Ijazul Ahsan ordered Commissioner Capt (retd) Saif Anjum to arrange passport and other travel documents of Munir so that he could go to a country of his choice for education.

The Aitchison College had rusticated Munir on allegation of perversion and the government, on previous directions of the court, got him admitted to the Divisional Public School.

A representative of the Aitchison College presented a report about the expulsion of the student, accusing him of moral turpitude which made CJP Gulzar Ahmed infuriated. “I have gone through the letters written by the principal about the student. He has accused Munir of involving in immoral activities, the CJP said.

“Do you have any proof to substantiate you allegations. Prima facie these accusations seem to be false, the CJP said to the representative of the college, adding that the institution administration had badly treated the teenage student.

Justice Umar Ata Bandial remarked that Aitchison is not the prime institution of the country as it is creating problems in the society. Its students and teachers both are stubborn. He regretted that an attempt has been made to ruin the future of the student because no other educational institution is ready to admit him.

During the hearing, the CJP also took the commissioner to task after he presented a report, suggesting that Naveed Munir was undergoing psychological treatment. The commissioner said the service of an expert psychologist has been hired who had conducted a counseling session with Munir.

Justice Bandial chided the commissioner for not taking care of the student, saying that he was appointed custodian of Munir, but he never went to see him. “Do not act like an officer in the courtroom. Have you ever asked the boy about his needs? It was your responsibility. Look after him like your own son, the CJP admonished him.

“He does not need psychology treatment. He needs love and affection and a congenial atmosphere to become a good human being, Justice Bandial said to the commissioner.

The CJP also addressed the boy and advised him to take care of himself and asked the commissioner to make all necessary preparations to send him abroad for higher education. He encouraged the boy and advised him to concentrate on his education, assuring him that he will be facilitated to go abroad for education.

Munir was living with his stepmother after the death of his father and was clueless about the whereabouts of her real mother who was divorced when he was a baby. His family had abandoned him to grab his costly properties after the death of his father and the former CJP had appointed the Lahore commissioner his guardian about one and a half years ago.",['Our Correspondent'],"LAHORE: The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Friday directed the Lahore commissioner to furnish a report regarding the mental and physical health of a 17-year-old boy who was rusticated by the Aitchison College.

He needs love and affection and a congenial atmosphere to become a good human being, Justice Bandial said to the commissioner.","['rusticated', 'lahore', 'bandial', 'cjp', 'student', 'report', 'commissioner', 'aitchison', 'munir', 'directs', 'furnish', 'justice', 'boy', 'court', 'supreme']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/700X390_thenews.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-02-15/614196_4324202_gulzar-justice_akhbar.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-11/ss_756866_073204_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-02-15/l_614196_062457_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-12-11/ss_756867_073745_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-02-15/l_614196_062457_updates.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'Supreme Court directs commissioner to furnish report on rusticated boy | Pakistan | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'LAHORE: The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Friday directed the Lahore commissioner to furnish a report regarding the mental and physical health of a 17-year-old boy who was rusticated by the Aitchison...', 'keywords': 'supreme,court,directs,commissioner,furnish,report,rusticated', 'fb': {'app_id': 650123461797330}, 'og': {'title': 'Supreme Court directs commissioner to furnish report on rusticated boy', 'image': {'identifier': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-02-15/l_614196_062457_updates.jpg', 'secure_url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-02-15/l_614196_062457_updates.jpg', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'width': 390}, 'description': 'LAHORE: The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Friday directed the Lahore commissioner to furnish a report regarding the mental and physical health of a 17-year-old boy who was rusticated by the Aitchison...', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/614196-supreme-court-directs-commissioner-to-furnish-report-on-rusticated-boy', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@thenews_intl', 'creator': '@OCOur Correspondent', 'title': 'Supreme Court directs commissioner to furnish report on rusticated boy', 'description': 'LAHORE: The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Friday directed the Lahore commissioner to furnish a report regarding the mental and physical health of a 17-year-old boy who was rusticated by the Aitchison...', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-02-15/l_614196_062457_updates.jpg?t=015418'}, 'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style': 'black-translucent', 'apple-mobile-web-app-title': 'The News International', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#333333', 'theme-color': '#000000'})",[],news
https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/27896-a-somber-farewell-to-senators,,A somber farewell to senators,"ISLAMABAD: No matter how delightful is a farewell but it is a message to departures that ‘the party is over’ and it is always painful to say goodbye, especially to those who have rare chances for a comeback.

The unannounced week-long farewell session of the Senate witnessed no spark and it was duller than any other day.

Sughra Imam created a stir. Usually people lack interest when their time is about to be over; they just relax and prefer to go to exit door. But a few remain till the end to enjoy the party. Sughra Imam is the one who throughout her stay in the Senate played active role and due to her efforts the Senate passed her Anti-Honour Killing Amendment Bill 2014 this week. After this amendment, honor killing would be non-compoundable and convicted person cannot escape culpability after giving blood money.

It was a commendable effort on part of her and civil society. The House would miss her but Treasury’s front row and Baboos would be relaxed as they would get rid of tricky and technical questions.

Senator Zahid Khan also played his due role till the last days and made his point about the change in route of economic corridor which fell on deaf ears. Haji Adeel, Afrasyiab Khattak and Zahid Khan were the hawks of the ANP and their contribution to the Upper House was commendable. Humayun Khan Mandukhel, Zahid khan, Haji Adeel, Afrasiyab Khattak, Ch Shujaat, Syed Muzafar Ali Shah, Syed Zafar Ali shah and Mola Bukhs chandio would be remembered as they took the business seriously.

Knowing the fact, 5o percent of senators would be replaced, the House’s mood was a bit dull which was natural. Emotional speeches were missing to acknowledge the services of outgoing senators at the time of bidding them farewell. Senate Chairman Nayyar Hussain Bukhari and his deputy Sabir Baloch were also among those who played their innings. The issue of perks and privileges of a former chief justice was resolved as the attorney general briefed the House

properly. Those who were in a bid to create a stir were disappointed. Comprehensive answers by bureaucracy were a common issue and it irritated the House and the chairman Senate often. The chairman Senate declared the secretary finance could be summoned in the privilege committee for incomplete answers.

At the patron of Confession Box of the Roman Catholic Church, we have established a ‘Conscience Box’ in the parliament where the parliamentarians share their views beyond their party lines, obviously on the condition of anonymity and secrecy. The journalists’ only interest is getting information. The other day, Interior Minister Ch Nisar was upset over linking the arrest of certain terrorists with attacking the March 23rd parade without any concrete evidence. Especially, when the Chinese president was said to be the guest on Pakistan day parade, this news might sabotage the whole event.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/711973-reduced-crowds-unlikely-to-lower-covid-spread-risk,,Reduced crowds ‘unlikely to lower Covid spread risk’,"LONDON: Academics have warned reopening stadia with reduced crowd numbers is unlikely to lower the risk of spreading Covid-19.

Researchers at the University of Reading claim without effective social distancing measures for fans before, during and after matches, rates of transmission will most probably not fall. Analysis of the number of coronavirus cases and deaths following matches played in England’s top eight divisions in the weeks prior to the 2019/20 season’s suspension showed links to higher Covid-19 cases and deaths in the local area.

The study found there were on average around six additional cases, two additional deaths, and three additional excess deaths per match per 100,000 people in the areas the games were played, with similar increases in the areas the away teams came from.

This increase was no lower after matches with low attendances than those with capacity crowds. “Our study backs up the view that reducing crowd sizes on its own is unlikely to lower the risk of spreading of the virus,” said professor James Reade, a sports economist at the University of Reading and lead author of the study.

“Even when stadiums are only partially filled, fans tend to pack together in groups. They also mix in bar areas, toilets, and queues, as well as in pubs, shops and restaurants outside the grounds. “This behaviour presents an effective route for airborne viruses to spread and is no less prevalent with smaller crowds.

“It must be noted that our findings linking cases and matches offer only observational evidence regarding the infection risk in under-capacity stadiums.

“While it is difficult to compare data before and after lockdown – as people’s behaviour and rules have changed on transport and in shops, for example – our findings do suggest pilot events will be essential to planning for the safe return of crowds to sporting events.”

The study evaluated matches played in February and March 2020 and their effect on deaths and excess deaths in April 2020 and found matches in March had a larger impact on Covid-19 cases and deaths in the areas of both the home and away teams as the virus became more widespread.",[],"LONDON: Academics have warned reopening stadia with reduced crowd numbers is unlikely to lower the risk of spreading Covid-19.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/567212-legacy-child-abuse,,The legacy of child abuse,"In the last days of 2018, a nine-year-old girl in Lahore was tortured, raped and strangled to death. In the first few day of 2019, the suspected murderer of an eight-year-old girl in Nowshera confessed to a similar crime before an anti-terrorism court. In the first month of 2019, a 12-year-old female resident of Kasur went missing after she went to attend a local seminary. Her whereabouts are still unknown.

Between January and June 2018, a total of 2,322 cases of child sexual abuse were reported in Pakistan -- a 32 percent increase in a year, as reported by Sahil, an NGO working on child protection with focus on child sexual abuse. This means that about 12 children are sexually abused in Pakistan every day. This also means that repeated cases of child sexual abuse, including the much-talked-about case of seven-year-old Zainab from Kasur -- raped, murdered and carelessly abandoned in a heap of trash - has not startled us out of our slumber.

In 2017, the National Commission of Human Rights (NHCR) constituted a three-member fact finding committee to probe child abuse cases reported between 2015 and 2017 in Kasur. It found that 720 cases of sexual abuse were reported in three years. The city is labelled by some as the ‘child rape capital of Pakistan’.

The committee observed that seven out of 16 accused arrested were acquitted by the anti-terrorism court (ATC) due to lack of coordination between the prosecution and the police.

The parents of eight raped and murdered girls in Kasur since 2015 appeared before the Supreme Court in 2017 and pleaded for justice before the three-member bench of the court that heard Zainab case. The bench remarked, ""Had the police taken the matter seriously in 2015, lives of eight girls might have been saved.""

This was despite Pakistan tightened its legislation to protect children in 2016, thereafter criminalising sexual assault, child pornography and trafficking for the first time, after a pedophile ring involved in circulating pornographic videos was exposed -- yet again in Kasur.

A common criticism on the overall law and order situation, as well as cases of child abuse is that police does not spend time on the crime scene and follow-up investigations. It is a widespread belief in Pakistan that inefficient police investigation results in weak prosecution -- hence the conviction rates are low.

""Police officers often become arbitrators in criminal cases,"" alleges Advocate Ahsan Khan. ""This was a strategy used by the British to maintain law and order. The police still follow the same rules.""

The police, however, blame the judicial system.

""It is actually the structural flaws in the criminal justice system and prolonged cases in courts that result in the public having no hope and the culprit no fear before committing a crime,"" says SP Investigation Shah Nawaz from Lahore Cantonment. ""Although the procedure to investigate murder cases is the same for adults and minors, there has been no recent reform or module in investigation. Child abuse cases are being prioritised by the police and recently, abducted minors have been recovered.""

Zainab’s murderer Imran Ali’s arrest ensued a debate on the nature and intensity of his punishment. Zainab’s parents fought a case in the court for a public execution. Imran was ultimately hanged to death on an autumn morning last year.

Under the current law, punishment for rape can either be death penalty or 10 to 25 years of imprisonment. Many argue that capital punishment may prove a deterrent against such crimes but legal experts hold a different opinion. ""When studying law, we were taught that it is the certainty of punishment and not severity of punishment that prevents crime,"" argues Barrister Ahmed Pansota. ""Even if the punishment is a fine, its regular enforcement keeps criminals at bay.""

The advocate shared an incident of 1981, when in Lahore, a young boy’s lifeless body was recovered from near a pond. General Ziaul Haq’s regime sentenced the kidnapper and killer to death. He was publicly hanged. The man’s body hung in full view for an entire day. Yet, between 1983 and 1992, 11 similar incidents of rape were committed against minors, as young as four years old.

In this worrying situation, many voices have been raised in favour of sex education in the country. Yet, sex education in schools, a common concept in the West, is a taboo topic in most of Pakistan.

In 2014, an elite private school in Lahore was forced to remove all sex education from its curriculum. ""It is against our constitution and religion,"" said the then president of the All Pakistan Private Schools Federation, Mirza Kashif Ali. At the same time, teachers operating in eight schools run by a local organisation in Johi, a village in Sindh, started imparting sex education to their students. Their sex education lessons, starting at age eight, covered changes in their bodies, their sexual rights and how to protect themselves against any physical or verbal attacks. Although bound by traditions and with relatively lower rate of literacy, none of the villagers objected.

""When you talk about your bodies you set a precedence that it’s alright to talk about it,"" says Daheem Din, a Marriage and Family Therapist, based in Lahore. ""If one forms a healthy image of oneself and the opposite gender, the curiosity among children settles down. It helps them deal with adolescence and leads them to be respectful of themselves and others.""

Last year, the Punjab government decided to introduce child protection curriculum in every educational institute of the province, including supplementary material based on injunctions of the Holy Quran. It was also decided to make the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau responsible for dealing with psychological issues of abused children.

While teachers of religious education can play an important role in inculcating moral values in their students, some have been accused of doing otherwise.

In 2017, when a cleric was caught red handed with his victim in a madrassah in a village in Punjab, the police were unable to pursue the case since pressure from militant groups forced the parent to drop charges and ‘forgive’ the attacker. This was one of the three cases that emerged in South Punjab in one month, which included gang rape of a 12-year-old boy by former students of a madrassah and the rape of a ten-year-old who was sodomised by the madrassah’s principal.

""It is not just the case with the madrassah system but all institutions which have children’s hostels,"" says Dr Shahzad Saleem. ""In many hostels, child and adult sexual malpractices are common. All hostels must be reformed.""

It seems that there can be no single deterrent to help reduce the number of child abuse cases. Squabbles between the judicial and the law enforcement systems further complicate the situation. Almost all experts agree that a change in the societal mindset is the key to solution. This may seem like a daunting task but dedication can start bearing some fruit in future.

""Punitive measures should be adopted but it must be understood that punishments cannot solve the problem,"" reiterates Dr Shehzad Saleem. ""Education, learning, changing mindsets and setting healthy social trends is the way forward.""",[],"Between January and June 2018, a total of 2,322 cases of child sexual abuse were reported in Pakistan -- a 32 percent increase in a year, as reported by Sahil, an NGO working on child protection with focus on child sexual abuse.
This also means that repeated cases of child sexual abuse, including the much-talked-about case of seven-year-old Zainab from Kasur -- raped, murdered and carelessly abandoned in a heap of trash - has not startled us out of our slumber.
In 2017, the National Commission of Human Rights (NHCR) constituted a three-member fact finding committee to probe child abuse cases reported between 2015 and 2017 in Kasur.
Child abuse cases are being prioritised by the police and recently, abducted minors have been recovered.""

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/715541-na-divided-over-public-hanging-of-rape-convicts,,NA divided over public hanging of rape convicts,"ISLAMABAD: The members of the National Assembly while discussing the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway rape case on Tuesday demanded exemplary punishment for those involved in rape crimes against women but division was visible on death penalty and public hanging for culprits.

Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry fell short of demanding capital punishment for culprits involved in rape crimes, but he called for reforming the justice system in the country to increase conviction rate in rape cases to prevent such inhuman acts. He also suggested that a rape victim should be treated as victim of violence and women investigation officer should be appointed to handle such cases.

Fawad Chaudhry observed that the recent tragedy had shaken the nation and people wanted that culprits should be hanged publicly, saying that anger in public increases when such incidents happen repeatedly. He observed that in the Zainab case, the culprit was hanged and another person namely Mudassar, who was stoned to death by people, was found innocent.

However, he said the hanging of a culprit has not resulted in preventing tragic incidents, and rape cases were continuously happening. “We need to reform the justice system in a way that punishment is awarded in shortest time and there should be no reconciliation between the aggrieved party and culprits,” he said.

Maulana Abdul Akbar Chitrali of Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), while strongly condemning the tragedy, said such cases could have been prevented had the government removed shortcomings in the Zainab Alert Bill.

He demanded that punishment for culprits involving in rape cases should be decided in the light of the injunctions of Holy Quran and Sunnah. “The Holy Quran categorically directs for punishment for married and unmarried persons involving in rape cases with consent or without consent,” he said.

The JI parliamentarian, however, opposed castration of men involved in gang rape cases as proposed by Minister for Human Rights Dr Shireen Mazari. “I question as to what will happenif a women rapes a man,” he said.

However, he said the suggestion from the minister has proved that there were shortcomings in the Zainab Alert Bill. He recalled that following public hanging of culprits involved in raping a child during General Zia regime, no such incident occurred for the next 10 years.

The PPP parliamentarian Raja Pervaiz Ashraf regretted that the justice system has not been able to yield results to prevent such incidents. “In our system, it is the victim who suffers while culprit escapes punishment,” he said, adding that most of rape cases could not reach logical conclusion.

Minister of State for Climate Change Zartaj Gul regretted that the opposition used the tragedy for political point scoring. She suggested that a committee should be constituted to decide as to how to take forward the Shariah laws, saying that names of victim women and children should be kept secret.

Amir Haider Hoti of the ANP demanded disciplinary action against the police officer who gave irresponsible statement with regard to the rape incident. The PPP parliamentarian Hina Rabbani Khar said not only the tragic incident but also the irresponsible statement given by the police officer had shaken the whole country. “What compelled the police officer to give such statement,” she said, questioning whether he was giving message that no woman should come out of her house in night time.",['Muhammad Anis'],"He also suggested that a rape victim should be treated as victim of violence and women investigation officer should be appointed to handle such cases.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/604898-usman-buzdar-is-there-to-stay-no-one-can-blackmail-me-says-pm-imran,,"Usman Buzdar is there to stay: No one can blackmail me, says PM Imran","PESHAWAR/LAHORE: Amid differences between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan and his key cabinet members, three provincial ministers were sacked on Sunday.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday categorically ruled out removal of Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar, and warned that nobody could blackmail him at all.

Those removed included Health Minister Shahram Khan Tarakai, Tourism, Sports and Culture Minister Mohammad Atif Khan and Revenue and Estate Minister Shakeel Khan. Shahram Tarakai and Atif Khan are related to each other.

The ministers were sacked for not heeding the cabinet’s decisions and creating difficulties, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Information Minister Shaukat Yousafzai was reported as saying by Geo News.

Prime Minister Imran Khan, Yousafzai added, decided to remove them for their negative behaviour. Sunday’s notification had also said the lawmakers were removed from office with ""immediate effect"".

The information minister said no one would be allowed to blackmail the ruling PTI or the government. Khan was also a candidate for the KP chief minister post but was given the biggest ministry, as well as, four provincial departments, he added.

Atif Khan never accepted incumbent Mahmood Khan as the chief minister and continued to create difficulties, Yousafzai explained. According to senior leaders of Pakistan Tehreek-I-Insaf (PTI), Prime Minister Imran Khan had personally approved the removal of the three ministers.

There had been differences for quite some time between the chief minister and some of his cabinet members including, Shahram Khan Tarakai and Atif Khan. However, it was stated to be a difficult decision for Chief Minister Mahmood Khan to remove Shahram Tarakai and Atif Khan from the cabinet as both were considered to be close to Prime Minister Imran Khan.

Shahram Tarakai and Atif Khan had long association with Imran Khan and were in the good books of the PTI chairman. It was not less than a surprise to many party leaders, including Shahram Tarakai and Atif Khan, that Imran Khan would sack them ignoring their long association with him and PTI. The two ministers and some other party legislators were reportedly critical of Mahmood Khan in indoor meetings for his alleged poor performance and growing corruption in the government that damaged PTI’s image in the public.

According to the party insiders, Shahram Tarakai and Atif Khan before publicly criticising the chief minister had raised the issue with the prime minister and informed him a number of times that corruption was rising in government departments. They said Imran Khan was not happy over the differences between the chief minister and the two senior ministers.

Senior party leaders were expecting Imran Khan to call the two sides to Islamabad and listen to them. “Our assessment was that he will call them and carefully listen to their complaints. We expected he would constitute a committee of senior PTI leaders to resolve the issues between the chief minister and the cabinet members,” said a senior PTI leader in Peshawar.

Pleading anonymity, he said until Friday the prime minister had no intention of taking such a serious action against the cabinet members, but when he called Mahmood Khan to Islamabad upon his return from overseas he changed his mind.

According to PTI leaders, some senior party leaders from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa played a “very negative role in creating doubts in the mind of the prime minister and made him believe that Shahram Tarakai and Atif Khan were in fact creating problems for the government.”

“The prime minister even without listening to the other side of the story removed the ministers from their positions. I am sure he was presented a wrong picture and I know certain people played a very negative role in this crisis,” said a party insider.

Also, sources close to the prime minister in Islamabad told The News that there were rumours in the party that Imran Khan is expected to replace the chief ministers of Punjab and KP in March or April 2020. In KP, it was reportedly discussed that Atif Khan is the favourite choice of Imran Khan to replace Mahmood Khan.

“I don’t know if Imran Khan had any such plan for Atif Khan but some people told the prime minister that Atif Khan and his group was creating problems for the PTI government in KP at the behest of some key powerful quarters. And that could be one of the reasons he removed them from the cabinet without listening to them,” said the PTI leader in Islamabad.

According to sources, Mahmood Khan was initially reluctant to take action against the cabinet members but some other party people opposed to Shahram Tarakai and Atif Khan instigated him and assured him of their support.

“It is no more a secret that things are not satisfactory in KP and the chief minister is not delivering. I am afraid that people who supported him in this critical situation will now blackmail him to make decisions as per their wish,” said a PTI legislator close to the chief minister.

This correspondent spoke to Shahram Tarakai and Atif Khan and both said they didn’t expect the decision. They, however, avoided to react to their removal and said they would respond in time.

“Obviously, we didn’t have any personal interest and our sole aim was to bring relief to the common man in the province. We may or may not react to this decision as we don’t believe in blackmailing or maligning people,” said Shahram Tarakai.

There were media reports that Prime Minister Imran Khan had called the two senior ministers to Islamabad after their removal but Atif Khan denied these reports.

Earlier, sources close to the chief minister told The News that the differences cropped up after Mahmood Khan refused to accommodate in the cabinet some party MPAs recommended to him by the cabinet members.

“There would have been no issue had the chief minister adjusted their nominees in the cabinet. The chief minister used to hold them in high esteem as he knew about their connections with Imran Khan and status in the party,” said a PTI office-bearer close to the chief minister.

Also, the sources said that Mahmood Khan was already under pressure from National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser and Federal Minister Ali Amin Gandapur who wanted him to adjust their younger brothers in the cabinet, which he refused.

Mahmood Khan’s opponents had also alleged that he had no role in the governance and was letting non-elected people make important decisions.

They particularly mentioned names of two senior bureaucrats, one sitting in Islamabad and close to the prime minister, and another close to the chief minister in Peshawar for allegedly making all important decisions of KP government.

In Lahore, the prime minister firmly supported Punjab CM Usman Buzdar while speaking to parliamentarians, ministers and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Punjab office-bearers at 8-Club Road here.

The PM said he would not succumb to any pressure and made it clear that Usman Buzdar was the chief executive in Punjab and the bureaucracy was under his command.

Punjab CM Usman Buzdar, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and senior leaders of the PTI Punjab as well as senior officials of central and Punjab governments were also present.

The PM met MNAs and MPAs from Punjab in two different sessions in which most of his party members slammed the Punjab bureaucracy over lack of cooperation with them. An MPA from Rawalpindi lodged complaint about the Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) concerned for not paying attention to the genuine grievances of people. He said the police official did not even bother to pick phone calls of the MPAs.

The PM took notice of the situation and directed the officials concerned to address the complaint. Similarly, some of the MPAs also lodged complaints that bureaucrats were obliging one another and favouring their relatives but their dealing with the elected team of Punjab was totally different. They complained that their development projects were not being implemented.

Some of the members also urged the prime minister to empower his chief minister. At this, according to sources, the PM categorically stated that Buzdar was the chief executive of the province.

He directed the Punjab government to address all just grievances of the MNAs, MPAs and at the same time, he stated that no tolerance would be shown towards unlawful and corrupt practices. The PM also directed his political and official teams not to promote nepotism even if anyone was PM’s relative. He also asked his team to pay attention to development of their areas, which could not be ignored at all.

The PM also called for evolving an effective mechanism, aimed at solving problems of people and creating a good coordination between bureaucracy and the elected representatives.

Imran Khan made it clear that he had never succumbed to any pressure in the past nor would he do so in future. He said he had passed through a testing phase and now things were moving in the right direction and urged his stalwarts to avoid infighting and continue to move ahead with a positive intent.

Imran Khan also took his team into confidence over his recent visit to Davos and stated that now Pakistan was being envisaged as a safe country from investment point of view and situation was improving for the country. He said the foreign companies had shown interest in investing in Pakistan.

The PM said he knew who was a conspirator, and from where he was hatching plans against Punjab chief minister, according to Geo News.

The prime minister said he knew who was creating a controversy to oust Buzdar and that the conspirator wanted the post for himself.

“If the incumbent CM was removed, the new one, too, would be forced to step down in a similar manner,” the prime minister warned. A new chief minister, if appointed, would not even last 20 days, he added.

The premier said there was negative propaganda that Buzdar did not have the required authority; however, the chief secretary and inspector-general (IG) of Punjab were new and would work as part of the CM's team, he added. The premier told the meeting participants that CM Buzdar had complete authority.

PM Imran also tasked the Punjab government to quickly hold municipal elections at a village-council level, emphasising that lower-level

Arshad Aziz Malik adds: This correspondent had reported in Jang and The News that differences between KP CM Mahmood Khan and some of his cabinet members had deepened and that PM Imran had also taken notice of the friction.

Senior PTI leaders had told the publication on Thursday that certain people in the party also took notice of the differences and decided to constitute a jirga to resolve the issue before it damages the government and the party.

Meanwhile, expressing satisfaction over the performance of Jam Kamal Khan,Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani on Sunday said that he will remain the chief minister of Balochistan, reported a private news channel.

Talking to journalists along with Balochistan Assembly Speaker Abdul Quddus Bazanjo and Defence Minister Pervez Khattak in Islamabad, Sadiq Sanjrani said that Jam Kamal is ensuring good governance in the province and he will continue his services as chief minister of the province.

The Senate chairman underscored the need for dialogues to resolve issues. On the occasion, the Balochistan Assembly speaker thanked the leadership for hearing grievances and said that strengthening Balochistan will further strengthen Pakistan.

Pervez Khattak, in his remarks, said the committee constituted by the prime minister is in contact with other parties of the province. It is pertinent to mention here that Bizenjo had submitted a privilege motion against Balochistan CM on January 24. He was of the view that the CM’s remarks about him were unnecessary and non-parliamentary.

Earlier on January 23, Chief Minister Balochistan Jam Kamal had said that he was not giving much attention to the remarks of the Speaker Balochistan Assembly Abdul Quddus Bizenjo and had said that the coalition government in the province had performed after coming into power.

He had said that the government should only be judged by the works it had carried out rather than hurling blames at each other. “It would not matter if I say that the Center or a province is not performing to my expectations,” he had said.","['Faizan Bangash', 'Mushtaq Yusufzai']","Meanwhile, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday categorically ruled out removal of Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar, and warned that nobody could blackmail him at all.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/662426-this-is-how-police-solved-boy-s-murder-mystery-in-48-hours,,This is how police solved boy’s murder mystery in 48 hours,"LAHORE:The Lahore Investigation Wing police have really performed a miracle by saving huge expenses on DNA tests, which had cost Rs 80m to the Punjab police in the Zainab murder case, and solved a child abuse and murder case by only one DNA test and above all within 48 hours.

On May 16, 10-year-old boy Ghulam Mustafa was found dead from an under construction plaza in Nawab Town. The condition of the body and circumstantial evidence implied that the boy had been abused and murdered.

The murderer also tried to set the boy ablaze and create an impression that the boy had tried to set himself on fire. The killer failed to burn the body as he heard someone’s loud voice in the plaza that was also used by locals as a shortcut passage to reach their locality. He placed the body in the washroom, locked the room from inside and escaped through a small window over the door.

The matter was brought to the notice of DIG Investigation Lahore Dr Inam Waheed, who reached the crime scene and constituted eight teams to solve the mysterious death. The first team was directed to talk to local children, the second team was asked to identify people who were involved in such crimes, the third team was ordered to interview local labourers, the fourth team was asked to engage local vendors for information, the fifth team was to interview locals, the sixth team was tasked with checking locals as well as CCTV cameras, the seventh team was in contact with family members of the victim and the eighth team was supposed to coordinate with all teams.

The idea to talk to the children in a friendly way worked and one of the children informed the police that a local of the area, Abdul Rehman, was involved in abusing children. Another child told the police that an abused victim and his family had left the locality. The police asked the boy to lead them to the house of the accused. Meanwhile, another team rushed to the houses of other victims, including the family which had migrated from Lahore.

The police team was informed by the family that Abdul Rehman had abused their child and they left the city in shame. As per police, Adbul Rehman had abused three boys after luring them as they played outside their homes.

His offense became more serious as he continued to evade capture, with the intervention of elders of the area, who requested the victims’ families to forgive him. There was a distinct pattern to his offences. In each case he approached his victims near to where he could easily abuse them. The swift investigation led the detectives to present evidence to Abdul Rehman, including a positive DNA match, which left him unable to deny his heinous crimes.

There is no shred of doubt that the Lahore Investigation Wing has saved the city from a new threat. A racket in Kasur in 2015 had caused the removal of then Kasur DPO Rai Babar Saeed, who is presently serving as DIG Operations Lahore.

The then Punjab Chief Minister had made Additional IG Special Branch Arif Mushtaq, DPO Rai Babar Saeed and two DSPs OSDs over their negligence and misreporting of the incident, following recommendations of the then IGP Mushtaq Ahmad Sukehra.",['Salman Aslam'],"The condition of the body and circumstantial evidence implied that the boy had been abused and murdered.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/710564-no-honour-in-murder,,No honour in murder,"The verdict delivered by a two-member bench of the Supreme Court that ‘honour killings’ are not honourable at all, and in fact just the opposite, serves women well in the country. In Pakistan today, over a thousand women are killed each year in the name of honour, according to data collected by various NGOs and the media. This of course, is far too many. There are also male victims of honour crimes, when both a woman and the man she has chosen to wed are murdered in the name of honour. Justice Faiz Isa in his detailed verdict, stated that the word ‘honour’, stems from the Urdu word ‘ghairat’ but that this was a mistranslation of the term. He said that because of this, it is often interpreted by people that an honour crime is something carried out in a worthy cause, and therefore, something which is worthy of praise. He said just the opposite is true. And that religious laws make this quite clear by banishing murder of this kind.

The two-member bench was hearing an appeal by a man already in jail who had filed a petition in 2015 against being imprisoned for the killing of his wife. He had originally been sentenced to death by a sessions court. But the Lahore High Court changed this to a term of life imprisonment on the basis that he had fired just once to kill his wife, and that this was an honour crime. Justice Faiz Isa emphasized the need for honour killings to be stopped. In this situation, he praised the efforts of the National Assembly and pointed out that it had passed several laws, which made it difficult for people to escape the maximum sentence by using ‘honour’ as the excuse to get away with what was pointblank murder.

We know that such crimes take place frequently in our country. Not all of them are reported. It is unclear how many may go unnoticed and undocumented in the records of any organization or any other institution. This in itself is highly disturbing. This is also disturbing that society continues to accept such crimes so widely. A murder in the name of honour is murder. There is nothing honourable about it, and the excuse that the killing is intended to save the reputation of the family and especially its male members, has been refuted time and again, by religious scholars. The matter needs to be taken up at more forums. The verdict delivered by the Supreme Court will help in this cause. It is essential that we act more firmly to stop honour killings of all kinds and protect women against such acts of violence carried out most often by their own family members. Justice Isa and his compatriot on the bench have done well in this case. We hope the matter can generate a broader debate on honour killings and lead towards laws, which can bring such killings to an end in a country that has seen far too many of them over the last many decades.",[],"There are also male victims of honour crimes, when both a woman and the man she has chosen to wed are murdered in the name of honour.

Talking to the artists, she said that art is a vibrant medium that can be used as a tool for social change. Marilyn also had a close interaction with the honour-killing victim’s family and offered her sympathy and support. She also took a keen interest in the display of paintings.

Among the senior most artists who encouraged the initiative are Mobina Zubeiri, Saeed Akhtar, Hajra Mansoor, Mansoor Rahi, and Kaleem Khan.

The exhibition

opened with a mime performance conceived by Alina Chaudry, playing the role of a girl victim with her patriarchal brother, played by Nasir. Orchestra Art Academy lead by Malik Faiz Bashir gave their best performance to add bring a lively musical touch to the evening. Flute was played skilfully by Salman Adil, ‘sitar’ by Arsalan Nizami, violin by Imran Khan and Aamir Hussain was on ‘tabla’.

During the poetry recital session, Ata Turab, a local poet and TV host recited Urdu poetry while English poetry was contributed by Shaheen Sultan Dhanji, a social development expert and a writer based in Canada.

The exhibition focuses more on the solutions in the form of law reforms and legislation along with changing the mindset of society through such initiatives. The exhibition also aims to protest against the brutal death of Sobia Khanum a week back. She was killed by her perpetrator who was her former husband — he learnt through their children that Sobia’s parents were planning to get her remarried. Her former husband sent a message through one of their children for Sobia to meet him under the pretence he wished to marry her again. Innocently Sobia fell under the trap and met him the next day. She was driven off by her former husband and few men, who then took her away from Pindi Ghaib village to a remote area and she was raped by those men, killed and her body was mutilated.

Upon hearing this heinous crime against a woman, Faiza Khan probed for information relating to what had occurred. She said, “I contacted artists and decided to collaborate into an interactive exhibition condemning honour killings. Immediately I contacted the victim’s family and invited them to speak at the inauguration for ‘In the Name of Honour’. Relatives and family of the victim were also present at the exhibition to share their grief and experience with the guests and participants.

A short video presentation was shown by Faiza Khan, highlighting the problem of honour killings in Pakistan, defining the term as acts of murder in which a woman is killed for her actual or perceived immoral behaviour. The average annual number of reported honour killings was estimated to be more than 10,000 per year in Pakistan. The presentation highlighted the legislation regarding the killings and how ineffective it has been on the ground level. Females in the family supported the attacks most of the times, as it is a community mentality.

HRCP’s statistics on honour killings show that they have been increasing despite of legislation. Faiza Khan boldly brought to light that honour killings has become an ‘industry’, involving tribes people, police and tribal mediators, which provides many opportunities to make money or obtain a woman in compensation. Reports about men who have killed other men in murders not connected with honour issues who then kill a woman of their own family and camouflage the murder as an honour killing. Numerous cases go unreported and almost all go unpunished. It is a thousand years of tradition supported by tribes, communities and influential people in the society.

A unique animated film on ‘Karo Kari’ was also screened at the exhibition by Saeed Mangi, a faculty member of NCA. The film was an eye opener on the issue. Discussions followed the performances and presentations that lead to many important decisions and ideas about upcoming projects of RASTAY. The organization announced on this occasion the new team members. Nahida Raza, who is also the curator of Jharoka Art Gallery was announced to be the new Art Director of Rastay, Islamabad Chapter and the artist Arif Khan was chosen as the Director of Communication and Media section. Faiza Khan and Shaheen Sultan continue to serve as President and Vice President of RASTAY respectively and Malik Faiz Bashir contributes as the director of environment sector of Rastay.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/657429-call-to-combat-domestic-violence-during-covid-19-pandemic,,Call to combat domestic violence during Covid-19 pandemic,"PESHAWAR: The civil society organizations here on Monday called upon the national disaster management agencies to take measures to combat domestic violence at a time when the country is facing the coronavirus pandemic.

The civil society organizations (CSOs) expressed appreciation for the actions that the provincial government had taken to protect citizens from the COVID-19 pandemic. The CSOs appreciated the swift actions of frontline medical staff and security agencies to fight the coronavirus pandemic.

Data released by UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, said that 31 million additional cases of gender-based violence (GBV) were expected if the lockdown continued for six months.

It said that if the lockdown continued for every three months, an additional 15 million extra cases of gender-based violence were expected. The data said that Covid-19 would disrupt efforts to end child marriages, potentially resulting in an additional 13 million child marriages taking place between 2020 and 2030 that could have been averted otherwise.

According to the CSOs, while the root cause of GBV was unequal power relations, the Covid-19 pandemic was likely to increase the known triggers of GBV.

Indications from women’s rights organizations and GBV service providers in Pakistan and elsewhere around the world during Covid-19 showed increased risks of gender-based violence. Qamar Naseem Programme Coordinator Blue Veins and co-chair EVAW/G Alliance KP said, “Women and girls are more affected by pandemics generally because of the gender inequality evident in society at large.

“Women and girls trapped in abusive domestic situations are in jeopardy because of the lockdowns and restrictions on their movements imposed by governments to contain the spread of the pandemic. We call on all the provincial and national disaster management authorities to give attention to this urgent issue so that support to victims of domestic abuse are included in their Covid-19 response plans,” he said.

Sana Ahmad, a women rights activist from “Girls Got Voice, said, “It is clear from pandemic that during health crises, women typically take on

additional physical, psychological and time burdens as caregivers.

As such, it is critical that all actors involved in efforts to respond to Covid-19 - across all sectors - consider GBV within their programs planning and implementation.

Taimur Kamal, Coordinator of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Civil Society Network, said, “The government needs to allocate adequate funding and have careful planning of shelters for women and girls escaping domestic abuse.

It means increasing the level of online support services including help-lines to police and social services.

It is clear that health workers and police services are working at full stretch dealing with the consequences of this pandemic, but it is crucially important that they liaise with civil society organizations so that necessary support is provided to the increasing number of victims of domestic violence as a result of Covid-19.”",['Bureau Report'],"PESHAWAR: The civil society organizations here on Monday called upon the national disaster management agencies to take measures to combat domestic violence at a time when the country is facing the coronavirus pandemic.

The anti-honour killing and anti-rape bills were originally laid before the Senate in January 2014. After review, revision and follow-up, they’re adopted by parliament on Thursday.

“Every year, hundreds of women have their rights violated, are abused physically or sexually, and even killed in the name of honour,” said UN Resident Coordinator Neil Buhne in a statement issued here.

Neil Buhne said the crisis of violence against women and harmful traditional practices had often been seen as private matters that were ‘outside’ justice.

“Passing and implementing effective laws and policies to protect the rights and well-being of survivors and strictly punish perpetrators can provide the foundation for a coordinated and comprehensive approach to end violence against women across the country,” he insisted.

The UN resident coordinator said the United Nations system stood ready to help Pakistani government address the marginalisation and discrimination against women.

He said all possible support would be provided to Pakistan to implement measures meant for strengthening effective implementation, including training of officials handling cases of violence against women, the establishment of mechanisms for monitoring and impact evaluation as well as accountability, and better coordination.",[],"Islamabad: The United Nations has appreciated the unanimous approval of the much awaited legislation against honour killings and rape by parliament and declared the development a historic success.

The UN resident coordinator said the United Nations system stood ready to help Pakistani government address the marginalisation and discrimination against women.","['united', 'effective', 'parliament', 'nations', 'legislation', 'violence', 'resident', 'rape', 'rights', 'coordinator', 'honour', 'women', 'hails', 'killing']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/700X390_thenews.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'UN hails legislation against honour killing, rape | Islamabad | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'Islamabad: The United Nations has appreciated the unanimous approval of the much awaited legislation against honour killings and rape by parliament and declared the development a historic...', 'keywords': 'hails,legislation,honour,killing,rape', 'fb': {'app_id': 650123461797330}, 'og': {'title': 'UN hails legislation against honour killing, rape', 'image': {'identifier': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'secure_url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'width': 390}, 'description': 'Islamabad: The United Nations has appreciated the unanimous approval of the much awaited legislation against honour killings and rape by parliament and declared the development a historic...', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/155933-UN-hails-legislation-against-honour-killing-rape', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@thenews_intl', 'creator': '@OCour correspondents', 'title': 'UN hails legislation against honour killing, rape', 'description': 'Islamabad: The United Nations has appreciated the unanimous approval of the much awaited legislation against honour killings and rape by parliament and declared the development a historic...', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg?t=020132'}, 'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style': 'black-translucent', 'apple-mobile-web-app-title': 'The News International', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#333333', 'theme-color': '#000000'})",[],news

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/720272-police-officer-martyred-as-cops-chase-fleeing-robbers,,Police officer martyred as cops chase fleeing robbers,"The additional station house officer (SHO) of the Gulistan-e-Jauhar police station was martyred on Friday morning in an exchange of fire with suspects who were trying to flee after stealing cash from a citizen within the limits of the Ferozabad police station.

The officer, 56-year-old Rahim Khan, was martyred in the Gulistan-e-Jauhar area after around-half-an-hour-long chase that began on Khalid Bin Waleed Road.

Police sources said the Ferozabad police immediately reached the scene when they received the information of a citizen being robbed on Khalid Bin Waleed Road as he got into his car after withdrawing cash from a private bank. As the police arrived there, the chase began after the suspects fled the scene in a white car.

Police across the district were informed about the incident and the Gulistan-e-Jauhar police led by additional SHO Rahim Khan started snap checking after installing a picket near the Safari Park. When police signalled a white vehicle to stop, those present inside opened fire, resulting in the additional SHO’s death.

Police said four suspects were present in the white car. As they opened fire, a bullet hit the officer who was on the front seat of a police van. After the firing, the suspects abandoned the car after some distance and escaped. According to eyewitnesses, one or two suspects were also injured after the police returned fire.

A contingent of police cordoned off the area and launched a search operation for the culprits. Confirming the incident, District East SSP Sajid Sadozai said Sub-Inspector (SI) Rahim Khan, who was serving as the additional SHO of the Gulistan-e-Jauhar police station, had embraced martyrdom in the line of duty. His body was shifted to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre.

The Sindh inspector general of police (IGP) also took notice of the martyrdom of the SI and sought a detailed report from the District East SSP, directing him to arrest the culprits behind the killing of the police officer.

Multiple CCTV footage of the police encounter circulated on the electronic media and social media. It can be seen in those footage that the police tried to intercept the criminals in the Ferozabad area at around 10:22am; however, they escaped in the white car.

Police again intercepted the suspects after they signalled them to stop their car in Gulistan-e-Jauhar during snap checking at around 10:47am. Police personnel can be seen chasing the criminals and attacked by them in the CCTV footage.

After the suspects abandoned the car, police impounded it. Police said bullet marks and blood stains on the car suggested that some of the suspects were also injured during the exchange of fire; however, they had not been arrested till the filing of this story.

Police added that the suspects’ car had a fake number plate as another car having the same number was on verification found to be with its owner. Various special police teams have been formed to trace and arrest the fleeing suspects. Police officials are also looking for hospitals where the injured suspects could be admitted for medical treatment. A case has been registered and further investigations are under way.

Funeral prayers

The funeral prayers for the martyred additional SHO were offered at the Police Headquarters,

Garden.

Senior police officials including Karachi Additional IG Ghulam Nabi Memon attended the prayers and paid tributes to the martyred cop. “The police Jawans who sacrificed their lives in the line of duty to eliminate terrorism and maintain law and order situation in Karachi are the pride of the police department,” the additional IG Karachi said.

“SI Rahim Khan embraced martyrdom during an exchange of fire with the four suspects involved in the robbery incident. Hundreds of Karachi policemen have so far sacrificed their lives in the line of duty.”

In a statement issued here, the AI said killing of social media celebrity Qandeel Baloch by her brother has highlighted the importance of the fact that crimes being committed by making the family honour basis should be stopped.

AI hailed the Punjab government’s decision on making the state complainant in Qandeel murder case under which the family members will have no legal right to pardon the accused in honour killing cases.

AI office bearer Champa Patel said basic reforms are needed to eliminate the pardon factor in the incidents of honour killing in Pakistan.AI, however, said that it was not in favour of capital punishment. Thousands of women and girls from all walks of life are facing the threat of falling victim to such crimes all over the country.

According to the current annual report of Human Rights Commission of Pakistan as many as 1,100 women were killed in the name of honour in Pakistan last year.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/250542-cg-shelton-reiterates-us-support-for-activism-against-gender-based-violence,,CG Shelton reiterates US support for activism against gender-based violence,"The US Consulate General of Karachi observed the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on November 25, kicking off a campaign, ‘16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence’.

Consul General Grace Shelton took the occasion to reaffirm the US government’s commitment to defending the rights of women and girls to live free from violence. On November 28, she delivered remarks as the chief guest at an event organised by the Aurat Foundation, called ‘Orange the World, Let’s Go Together, No More Violence’.

She joined representatives from the Sindh government, civil society organisations, and the arts – all committed to eradicating gender-based violence. Consul General Shelton said, “The United States is proud of its close partnership with governmental and non-governmental organisations in Sindh to support survivors of gender-based violence.”

The United States has invested over forty million dollars to help survivors get better access to health, security, and legal services in Sindh. The consul general also noted the US recently signed an agreement with UN Women for a three-year, $3.5 million project to help law enforcement prevent and respond to violence against women in Sindh and Balochistan. It has also supported shelters and half-way houses with training and materials. These safe places empower women to report crimes and get the assistance and skills they need to reenter society.

In remarks on the consulate’s Facebook page on November 25, Consul General Shelton introduced the consulate’s social media campaign, “Karachi Champions Combating Gender-Based Violence”.

Every day from November 25 until December 10, the consulate’s Facebook page spotlights a short interview with local heroes making a difference in Karachi’s hospitals, schools, government, and civil society organisations.

As in years past, the United Nations selected the colour orange as a unifying theme, and the

historical Consul General’s residence and Sindh Assembly building are both lit up in orange to mark the event.

Consul General Shelton said on Facebook, “Wiping out this stain on our societies requires each of us to speak up and take action. Whether it occurs at home or at work, downtown in the city or on the farm, gender-based violence should have no place in any society.”",[],"The US Consulate General of Karachi observed the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on November 25, kicking off a campaign, ‘16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence’.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/473175-three-pindi-policemen-gang-rape-girl,,Three Pindi policemen gang rape girl,"Rawalpindi: In a shocking incident three police constable (Muhafaz Force) of Rawalpindi Police abducted a 22-year-old girl, Mst Rafia Azeem from Bahria Town Phase-8 at around 2 a.m. on May 16, 2019 and allegedly gang raped her for the next two hours in the rear seat of official police vehicle before dropping her off near her hostel located in Commercial Centre, Satellite Town at around 4 am.

The three Rawalpindi Police constables were accompanied by a young civilian. They were identified as Constable Muhammad Naseer, Constable Rashid Minhas, Constable Muhammad Azeem and civilian young man Amir Sikandar. All four have been arrested and their medical tests have been conducted already.

According to the details of the horrifying incident revealed by the young girl in the First Information Report (FIR) she stated: “she, along with a friend, identified as Umair Azam Kiyani had gone to Bahria Town Phase-8 for some outing and to have ‘sehri’ for keeping fast.

“We were near ‘Statute of Liberty’ in Bahria Town Phase-7 when we were stopped by a white Toyota Corolla car, bearing registration no: ADB-332, in which four persons were riding.

“They pulled both of us out of our vehicle and forced me to sit in their car on gun point while they threatened and told my friend Umair Azam Kiyani to go away.

“They drove off some distance and then parked the vehicle on the road side and put dark blinds on the windows of the vehicle and raped me one by one in the back seat of the car.

Later, they dropped me off in Commercial Centre near my hostel. Before freeing me, they snatched Rs30,000 as well as a gold ring valued at Rs12,000.

“They also asked her to stay in contact in future as well as even dared to feed one contact number in her cell phone while hurling threats of dire consequences if she did otherwise.

She said that she was too ashamed of what had happened to her and terrified as well and it took her a whole day to pick up courage and compose herself to approach the police to file this FIR.

The FIR in the case has been registered in the Rawat Police Station under sections: 376B, 367A and 382 PPC.

Unfortunately, this is not the first time that such an incident occurred.

Back on 22nd May, 2005 a 15-year-old girl was raped by Islamabad Police officials inside the Shehzad Town Police Station and even earlier a 17-year-old girl was gang raped by police officials in Sialkot.

At that time even the then President Gen Pervez Musharraf was shocked over the incident and ordered a high level inquiry. It was learnt that the culprits involved in those cases were sentenced to different terms of imprisonments and fines.

However, at least in one case, the police managed to twist arms of the victims and reached an agreement with them to resolve the issue.

The most disturbing point in the whole issue is that the police, the department that is supposed to be protecting people and helping them in distress, itself is engaged in such heinous crimes.

The City Police Officer (CPO) Captain (r) Faisal Rana, reacting to the incident ordered immediate arrest of all the culprits involved in the incident and had already ordered a departmental inquiry besides registering the FIR against them.

When contacted, the CPO Captain (r) Faisal Rana said that the police has immediately responded to the complaint and all four persons, including 3 Pindi Police Muhafaz Force officials and one civilian have been arrested already.

“We have already conducted the medical of the victim as well as the four perpetrators of crime and the case has been referred to SP Investigations for strongest possible action against them. The minimum departmental action against them would be dismissal from service.

“Their crime is not of ordinary nature. They have shattered the people’s confidence in the police force.

The police is the protector of life, property and honour of the masses.

The FIR in the case has been registered in the Rawat Police Station under sections: 376B, 367A and 382 PPC.
Back on 22nd May, 2005 a 15-year-old girl was raped by Islamabad Police officials inside the Shehzad Town Police Station and even earlier a 17-year-old girl was gang raped by police officials in Sialkot.
At that time even the then President Gen Pervez Musharraf was shocked over the incident and ordered a high level inquiry.
The City Police Officer (CPO) Captain (r) Faisal Rana, reacting to the incident ordered immediate arrest of all the culprits involved in the incident and had already ordered a departmental inquiry besides registering the FIR against them.","['vehicle', 'rawalpindi', 'raped', 'ordered', 'young', 'girl', 'constable', 'policemen', 'town', 'officials', 'pindi', 'rape', 'gang', 'incident']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/700X390_thenews.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'Three Pindi policemen gang rape girl | Lahore | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'Rawalpindi: In a shocking incident three police constable  of Rawalpindi Police abducted a 22-year-old girl, Mst Rafia Azeem from Bahria Town Phase-8 at around 2 a.m. on May 16, 2019 and allegedly...', 'keywords': 'pindi,policemen,gang,rape,girl', 'fb': {'app_id': 650123461797330}, 'og': {'title': 'Three Pindi policemen gang rape girl', 'image': {'identifier': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'secure_url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'width': 390}, 'description': 'Rawalpindi: In a shocking incident three police constable  of Rawalpindi Police abducted a 22-year-old girl, Mst Rafia Azeem from Bahria Town Phase-8 at around 2 a.m. on May 16, 2019 and allegedly...', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/473175-three-pindi-policemen-gang-rape-girl', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@thenews_intl', 'creator': '@SAShakeel Anjum', 'title': 'Three Pindi policemen gang rape girl', 'description': 'Rawalpindi: In a shocking incident three police constable  of Rawalpindi Police abducted a 22-year-old girl, Mst Rafia Azeem from Bahria Town Phase-8 at around 2 a.m. on May 16, 2019 and allegedly...', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg?t=015835'}, 'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style': 'black-translucent', 'apple-mobile-web-app-title': 'The News International', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#333333', 'theme-color': '#000000'})",[],news
https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/131776-How-can-police-be-reformed,,How can police be reformed?,"In the presence of over a century-old Police Act, 1861 instead of the Police Order, 2002, no improvement can be brought in the department merely through fresh recruitment even under army supervision or by hiring 2,000 ex-servicemen without making it a modern and professional force, free of political interference.

Police can neither be reformed nor depoliticised without changing the basic mindset about Karachi that it’s a multi-ethnic city of 25 million, needing a truly metropolitan status like New York or London.

The decisions taken in back-to-back meetings this week – including the one chaired by Gen Raheel Sharif at corps headquarters and the apex committee meeting at CM House - are important to improve law and order, but before formalising a recruitment policy, it is important to look into the issue of old police order and why the Sindh government had enforced the 1861 Police Act, instead of the Police Order, 2002 which provides a solution to the problem through National Public Safety Commission.

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa model, which is close to the original Police Order, 2002, provides the way forward to make police non-political and a professional force. Though it still has lot of good officers and jawans, hundreds of personnel are being probed for their links with criminals or having criminal record.

Karachi needs a complete package ‘Karachi Action Plan’ and highly-effective police reforms. It’s neither a lengthy procedure nor a huge exercise.

Recruitment could be made through Public Safety Commission, while seeking army's help for training to combat terrorism and street crimes. Localised recruitment on strict merit ignoring ethnic lines can help as local people are well aware of the areas and know how to handle the situation. But there is certainly a need for complete supervision for which the apex committee can be expanded and could include the city mayor’s input as well

Institutions like Citizen-Police Liaison Committee (CPLC), which had been damaged due to political interference, could be reformed too.

The experiment of hiring ex-servicemen in the past was not be successful and according to a former IGP, the retired people even from the armed forces do not have the energy level required in combating criminals and terrorists in a city like Karachi.

Therefore, it would be better to have fresh recruitment, while some ex-officers can be used for their training or consultative purposes if, at all, there is a need.

Karachi has three major problems – political, civic and administrative which includes its police and local administration. Due to deep-rooted political problems which have now turned into a serious ethnic issue, there is no easy solution to the other two and as a result Karachi has turn into world's biggest ‘katchi abadi’.

Unfortunately, there is no political will to give Karachi the metropolitan status with a metropolitan police like New York and London or even a police commissioner as powerful as in Mumbai. It was also because of biased approach that the successive regimes, whether civilian or military, had failed in addressing the issue, thus further aggravating the situation.

In the past several commissions and reports on Karachi have called for local police system, powerful local government and a powerful mayor.

Police need a powerful IGP for which a consensus is needed between the federal and Sindh governments. But once an IG is appointed, he should be empowered to transfers/ postings and should have a strong say in the promotion, at least, to the level of DIG or even additional IGP.

Similarly, the Public Safety Commission must be comprising people from different walks of life, who do not have any conflict of interest.

There is no doubt that police had not only been politicised during the last three decades but also become more loyal to the regime rather than the state. Much was expected from the PPP-led Sindh government when the party won the election in 1988 and again in 1993 and 2008, that it would reform the police and make it more people friendly.

Police and security agencies were used against the PPP, first by the Zia regime and later under late Jam Sadiq Ali, but they too used police against their opponents and found the answer in making the force more politicised.

Therefore, the entire police force was politicised in a very systematic way and used against the rivals. In the process, it became a very corrupt institution.

Firstly, the military regime under Zia used the police force against the PPP workers and they had clearly instructions to involve them in the Al-Zulfiqar case. Later from 1990 to 1992, late chief minister Jam Sadiq Ali repeated the exercise.

Unfortunately, no efforts were made to reform the police during the 1992 army operation. Instead the target was to pick the MQM’s alleged militants and forced them to join rival factions. At times, this policy brought serious differences between the two premier intelligence agencies – ISI and MI.

In 1992, the then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif send a retired Lt-Gen, Shafiq-ur-Rehman to probe against police over the complaints of businessmen, women and others regarding extortion and harassment. Jam was the CM, Irfanullah Marwat adviser on home and DIG Samiullah Marwat. The trio has been accused by the PPP, in the opposition at that time, of creating a reign of terror in the city.

The Shafiq report confirmed most of the allegations after meeting the victims and questioning the officers concerned. It also recommended measures to depoliticise the police and punish the responsible. Most of these recommendations were brush under the carpet but DIG Marwat paid the price and lost his job. He was also sent to jail.

Under Benazir Bhutto's second government from 1993 to 1996, police was again tasked with targeting criminals and terrorists, but as it had replaced the army, which was withdrawn, the suspected MQM militants remained its focus. Though BB gave a freehand to Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar and the police chief, Dr Shoaib Suddle, they continued zooming in on the MQM, and many of its militants were killed extra judicially. This operation was stopped when even BB's own brother Mir Murtaza Bhutto was killed in an encounter.

BB could have reform the police in the presence of Suddle and his team but, at the end, some 16 police officers and constables faced imprisonment and trial in Murtaza's murder.

In the initial years of Gen Pervez Musharraf, police were used against political opponent but more in Punjab but, at the same time, he introduced Police Order, 2002 – considered as one of the best till this date. However, some important clauses were removed from the original order due to the pressure from certain political and non-political quarters.

If we can have a special force for China Pakistan Economic Corridor in view of its economic importance for the country, why not give a special status to Pakistan's economic hub and make a Karachi Metropolitan Police. If our enemies, whether internal or external, can conspire to sabotage Pakistan's game changer, it can also harm the country's commercial hub.

Unlike in the past operations, this operation, by and large, remained above political biased and this is the right time to bring major reforms in police instead of just increasing its strength.

Police can be reformed, if we really want to reform it, and can be depoliticised, if we really want to depoliticise it.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/674931-blackmail-indecision-and-breach-of-contract,,"Blackmail, indecision and breach of contract","LAHORE: There is a disconnection when we look at the state, and trade and industry, despite the fact that this government has interacted with the businesses much more than the previous regimes. The problem arises when government fails to act on agreed points.

In many cases, the government fully understands the impracticality of its decisions, but continues with those impracticable decisions. In some cases, the government is convinced that Pakistan having a full database of its citizen has the ability to document the entire economy, but feels constrained to implement this concept by linking all economic transactions with the CNIC numbers of buyers and sellers.

Government fails to even act on issues where businesses and state are on one page. It is reluctant to act on issues necessary for improving tax compliance fearing traders’ agitation.

Even before coming to power the ruling party assured the exporters that they would be provided gas and power at regionally competitive rates on long-term basis. After assuming power, the government announced to provide five exporting sectors a competitive power and gas tariff for six months.

The economic team never realised that exporters could never benefit from such benefit on short-term basis. When they negotiate the export deal they execute in four to eight months. They cannot evaluate their cost on a short-term concession.

This fact was made known to the economic planners in various meetings and they understood the underlying problem. Still next three energy and tariff concessions were again announced on six monthly bases. In the next budget the tariff concession has not been announced (as it requires subsidy).

At least exporters should have been informed that a policy was being drawn. However, exporters are also agitating for point scoring only. After steep decline in rupee value the electricity tariff is already in line with the regional power tariff. The cost of imported gas is also much lower than the cost of locally supplied gas.

Exporters this time around are facing the problems of declining demand in the global markets. No concessions would boost the demand.

Moreover, highly devalued rupee was so advantageous for our exporters that the Indians were finally forced to devalue their rupee as well. Still, during the PML-N regime one Indian rupee was equivalent to Rs1.70 Pakistani rupees.

Now one Indian rupee is equivalent to 2.10 Pakistani rupees. Our exporters have failed to take advantage of high devaluation.

Economic planners do not have the courage to confront the exporters lobby and insist that they enhance their efficiencies instead of pressing the government for further concessions.

Another contentious issue between the government and the businesses is that of CNIC. The government last year decided in principle to document all purchases from retailers through CNIC.

All retailers were asked to provide the CNIC number of all purchases above Rs25,000. The traders and even the industry agitated.

The matter was first deferred for one month, then two months and finally for six months. After lengthy negotiations, it was notified that from January 1, 2020 all purchases above Rs50,000 would be documented through the CNIC of the buyer.

The notification was not fully implemented by the time Covid-19 hit the economy. Traders started agitating that the demand has declined after pandemic and buyers are not ready to provide their CNIC.

Now in the budget for the next year it was announced that the CNIC number of the purchaser would be mandatory on purchase of goods or services worth Rs100,000 or above. Traders again are opposing it.

They know that they can exert pressure on the government and defer its implementation indefinitely.

All this is happening at a time when we are hard pressed for revenues; when we are desperate to enhance our productivity; when businesses need hand holding from the state to move on from depression to growth.

The government has never adopted a principled stance. It is always prone to pressure from vested interests.

Economy and growth are triggered through prudent policies of the state. A government has to exert its writ particularly in cases where it is convinced that it would benefit the nation and the economy in the long run.

It should be prepared to face short-term agitations instead of giving in to its justified stance. This could only be done by a leader who has confidence in his/her ability.",['Mansoor Ahmad'],"Government fails to even act on issues where businesses and state are on one page.

In a country established for Islam, the rulers had thrust a system based on tyranny and exploitation, exactly opposite to the message of Karbala which was to fight against oppression and tyranny, he said while delivering Friday sermon at Mansoora Masjid.

Siraj-ul-Haq said the passage of a so-called Honour Killing Bill by the joint session of the parliament in conflict with Quran and Sunnah proved that the ruling party was out to demolish the ideological boundaries of the country. He said denying the right of compromise to the parties in the cases of honour killings was repugnant to divine injunctions, and added that any law in conflict with the Shariah would not be tolerated.

He said the controversial Bill should have been referred to the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) for advice and deplored that a suggestion to this by the JI and other parties had not been accepted. He said the Bill had challenged the position of CII. He said the Constitution did not permit such a law and the ruling party and PPP should have respected the Constitution.

He said the message of Imam Hussain (RA) to the Ummah was not to yield before tyranny and injustice. Therefore, he said, all those who loved Imam Hussain (RA) would have to stand against tyranny. He said Imam Hussain never desired power. Instead, his struggle was for the rule of Holy Quran and Sunnah and he sacrificed his entire family for this great cause. Imam Hussain’s everlasting message to the believers was not to bow before tyranny and not refrain from laying down one’s life for the revival and survival of the Shariah system.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/688371-amber-heard-faked-injuries-for-blackmail,,‘Amber Heard faked injuries for blackmail’,"A live-in friend who witnessed Johnny Depp’s tumultuous marriage to Amber Heard told the Hollywood actor’s libel trial on Friday the actress faked her injuries in order to blackmail him.

The ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise star is suing the publisher and executive editor of Britain’s The Sun newspaper in London’s High Court over a 2018 story branding him a ""wife beater"".

The Sun says it can prove the 57-year-old abused the 34-year-old model and actress on 14 occasions before their two-year marriage fell apart in 2017. Depp kicked off proceedings last week by admitting he told Heard after a particularly stormy encounter the two were ""a crime scene waiting to happen"".

But the focus shifted from the actor’s alleged tendency to smash things up while high or drunk to Heard’s credibility as Depp’s various bodyguards and staff took the stand this week. Depp’s childhood friend Isaac Baruch -- an artist who lived in the couple’s five penthouse apartment complex in Los Angeles -- said pictures of Heard’s injuries leaked to the media were ""phoney baloney"".

""She had filed a fraudulent domestic violence claim to push her hand and extort and blackmail him in the divorce,"" Baruch said. One photo in question shows the right side of Heard’s face around her eye covered in red markings.

But Depp’s friend said he saw Heard from ""12 inches away"" the next day and her skin was clear. ""I didn’t see a single bruise, redness, mark or the red tinted cellphone imprint that was advertised in (magazines). Nothing. Not anything,"" Baruch said.

Lawyer Sasha Wass, representing The Sun’s publishers News Group Newspapers (NGN), tried to cast Baruch as an unreliable witness who depended on Depp for his livelihood. She noted that Depp gave Baruch free accommodation and tens of thousand of dollars a year in living expenses.

Wass also asked how Baruch could be sure Heard was not covering up her bruises with makeup. Baruch said he was ""100 percent sure"" because he saw Heard four more times over the next three days.

""I saw no marks of any kind on either side of the face,"" he said. Heard has been attending the hearings daily but will only enter the witness box for the first time Monday. She can expect to be grilled by Depp’s lawyer about whether she had staged or otherwise misrepresented any of the photos of her face submitted to court.

The Sun’s lawyers said they received a notice from Depp’s team on Friday claiming that around 20 of the images had been ""adapted or manipulated"". Depp’s lawyers said the picture Baruch was being asked about had been ""photoshopped"".

Judge Andrew Nicol agreed to look into the matter further next week. But Wass presented an audio recording in which Heard told one of her staff that she covered up her bruises in public. ""I hid it from everyone,"" Heard said in the undated recording played in court.",[],"A live-in friend who witnessed Johnny Depp’s tumultuous marriage to Amber Heard told the Hollywood actor’s libel trial on Friday the actress faked her injuries in order to blackmail him.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/204284-DNA-testing-vital-in-cases-of-gender-based-violence,,‘DNA testing vital in cases of gender-based violence’,"A number of civil society and women rights activists, government officials and media personnel met Qazi Shahid Pervez, the provincial home secretary, and the Citizens-Police Liaison Committee chief Zubair Habib separately to discuss upgrading the forensics laboratory with DNA testing facilities.

Called the Provincial Steering Forum (PSF), the delegation included Shehla Qureshi, the city division’s SP, Ellahi Bakhsh Baloch and Raheema Panhwar from the Strengthening Participatory Organisation (SPO), civil society activists Lala Hassan and Saleem Abbasi, Zia Ur Rehman, a journalist, and DSP Shehla Ghani.

The delegation met Pervez at his office on Thursday and discussed the various aspects of handling gender-based violence cases, the appropriate time to report incidents, the procedure for medical treatment, timely evidence gathering and referrals to shelters.

SPO’s Panhwar said there were several instances where women had been denied justice due to a lack of evidence. “The importance of DNA evidence in cases of violence against women cannot be overstated,” she said.

Qureshi, a female officer representing the police department in the PSF, said women facilitation centres should be established at police stations or at SSPs’ offices, because survivors of gender-based violence were hesitant to relive their experiences in the presence of insensitive male law enforcement officers. “Female victims need access to women protection centres at police stations where they can register their cases and also temporarily take shelter there,” she suggested.

Home Secretary Pervez said DNA tests would not only help survivors of gender-based violence, but also prove invaluable in the identification of anonymous dead bodies. He agreed that an improved mechanism for sample collection and DNA preservation was direly needed.

He added that sufficient funds had been allocated to establish the forensics lab, and consultation about its management and data bank was underway between the CPLC and the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences.

Pervez advised the delegation to identify areas where the home and women development departments could collaborate to combat violence against women. The secretary also said he would write a sensitisation letter to police departments to set up women facilitation desks in at least 25 police stations.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/271400-child-abuse-talk-still-a-taboo-in-pakistan,,Child abuse talk still a taboo in Pakistan,"“I am a girl. My name is Zainab. My father’s name is Ameen. I am seven years old. I live in Kasur. I am student of grade one, and I like mangoes very much.”



This is the last writing of that innocent girl, which she penned as her introduction in her Urdu homework notebook as an ‘essay’ on her person. Then a cruel and apathetic savage pounced on these words and soaked them in blood. And today, every face has become a picture of helplessness; asking only one question: is it essential that every time a Zainab must sacrifice her honour and life to expose the apathy and cruelty of a savage?

The assault-cum-murder of innocent Zainab has shaken the conscience of the nation once again. Such incidents have ever been taking place all-over the world without any distinction of developed or developing and Muslim or non-Muslim countries.

Only two years back, child sex video scandal in Kasur made headlines in the national and international media, and then all went to a slumber of apathy once again. Now political point-scoring is going on over the Zainab tragedy. The social media is reverberating with an emotional syndrome, and the so-called intellectuals are suggesting various punishments for the culprit, who is yet to be arrested till filing of the report. In this backdrop, this report is being published.

22,528 children sexually assaulted in 71/2 years in Pakistan: During the past years, the number of child sexual abuse cases has gone up continuously. A study showed that during the past seven-and-a-half years, from 2010 to mid-2017, at least 22,528 cases of child sexual abuse were reported.

In 2010, 2,252 such incidents were reported; in 2011, the number went up to 2,303; in 2012, as many as 2,788 such cases were reported; in the next year, 2013, the number further went up to 3002; in 2014, a visible increase was seen with the total number of reported cases reaching 3,508; in 2015, the reported cases stood at 3,768; in 2016, 4,139 cases of child sexual abuse were reported; while in the first six months of year 2017, 768 incidents were reported.

However, it is a common belief that the number of child sexual abuse is much more than what is reported to the police or in the press. Mostly majority of such cases are not reported to the police due to the so-called ‘shame’ attached with the issue in our society.

According to year 2016 report, at least 11 children fell victim to sexual assault daily on an average in Pakistan. The total number of cases, involving sexual assault, kidnapping, going missing and forced child marriages, reported to the police stood at 4,139 in this year. The increase in the number of such cases was 10% compared with year 2015. The major crimes, committed against children, reported to the police, were 1,455 abductions, 502 rapes, sodomy 453, as many as 271 victims were gang-raped, cases of sexual assault involving more than one person stood at 268, while rape attempts reported were 362.

After sexual assault, 100 children were murdered. The total number of culprits was 1,765, while majority of them were either relatives or acquaintances of the victim children. The culprits included 798 persons whom the victims didn’t know earlier, 589 were acquaintances, 76 relatives, 64 neighbours, 44 maulvis, 37 teachers and 28 policemen.

In 2016, 76% cases of sexual abuse were reported from rural areas and remaining 24% were reported from city centres. As many as 2,676 cases were reported in Punjab, 987 in Sindh, 166 in Balochistan, 156 in Islamabad, 141 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, nine in Azad Kashmir and four in Gilgit-Baltistan.

In the first six months of 2017, the majority of child sexual assault cases were reported in Punjab.

Child abuse incidents in Pakistani seminaries: US news agency: An American news agency prepared a research report on child abuse and exploitation in Pakistani seminaries. However, most incidents are not highlighted because of two major reasons; one is that religious scholars, preachers or seminary teachers are very influential and the second is that discussing sexual abuse is considered a forbidden tree.

Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousuf, however, denied the news about increasing incidents of child sexual abuse in seminaries. He said such discussion was aimed at defaming religion, religious scholars and seminaries. Black sheep are everywhere and such incidents may take place off and on.

Committing child abuse is an incurable psychological disease which is called paedophilia in English. For the first time this term came to forefront in 19th century. This disease is linked to abnormal nervous system. The patient of this disease hesitates in having sexual relationship with any mature person; such person cannot live normal married life. Moreover, it is difficult for such person to have sexual relationship with a mature woman; he is attracted towards children. No cure for this disease has been found so far.

Types of sexual exploitation of children: Touching body parts: This type begins with unnecessary embracing the children; clinging; kissing and caressing. Parents need to keep their eyes open in this situation and they must be careful in case of frequent visits of relatives, children’s unnecessary interaction with domestic servants and family friends.

Pornography: In this type children are shown sexual pictures, videos and organs. In this situation, parents should keep an eye on their children when they use Internet at home and access to such sites need to be checked.

Unethical conversation: Children are trapped through vulgar conversation, pun, and jokes; such acts are done with children in solitude on Internet, social media.

Self-enjoyment: In this act children are forced to have sexual enjoyment. Such experience is horrible for innocent child but threats and greed keep the child silent and the victim child does not complain against the accused.

Sexual abuse: Targeting children through sexual abuse is the extreme situation. Mostly parents use to visit relatives or neighbours while leaving their children with servants or relatives; they must be careful because there are horrible results of such damned act and the criminals kill the affected children to conceal their sin.

Porno videos and pictures: Sometimes, the habitual criminals hurl threats at children and forcibly involve them in making obscene videos and pictures. The criminals also force their victims to bring other children with them for this act. These videos and pictures are uploaded on Internet. Kasur incident reported few years ago is also such an example.

Child prostitution: This is the worst form of sexual exploitation and children are kidnapped for this purpose.

What parents should do? Parents should be cautious and they should try to gain their trust and love. Children should be shown affection by their parents so that they do not need the attention of others. If they are neglected, someone else will become their sympathiser.

Parents should be alert to any sign of change on bodies of their children. They should reach to the bottom of injuries or bruises on their faces or bodies.

They should be aware about costly gifts to children including mobiles and seek explanation if they get a costly gift.

They should also notice if children stay out late or delay their return home.

Inform children about how to react when someone touches them. They should be informed to raise the alarm or run away in case of a touch. Do not leave a child alone with a servant, neighbour, or relative.

Take care if your child is extremely happy or worried after the arrival of a guest, especially if they are of opposite sex.

The children must be given confidence so that they could speak up without any fear of harm. The children should be medically tested and examined by a psychiatrist.

Discussion on child abuse still a taboo in Pakistan: Many countries have introduced strict laws and punishment for child abuse. They included the issue in syllabus and trained children against it. They are trained to call emergency helpline. Parents are informed through TV how to save their children from abuse. Children activities on the Internet are monitored. Many countries have blocked sexual content.

A Britain agency closes down indecent sites. Britain, Canada and other countries have published booklets to educate children about the issue. Save The Children and other such organizations are working there.

India has also taken practical steps to protect children despite being a conservative society. Nobel Prize winner Kailash Satyarthi visited 22 sates to save children from abuse. Indian actor Amir Khan started a programme on the issue in 2012. It became popular among people. He taught children how to save themselves from beasts. His video has become viral after the Kasur incident.

However, it is still a taboo to discus the issue in Pakistan. Nobody can speak explicitly on TV for fear of decrees. Parents cannot talk to children on the issue because of shame and in this way we a pushing our children into darkness.

Why murder after abuse?: In most of cases, children’s relatives, friends, neighbours and drear-ones are their tormentors. They put pressure on children to keep quite after abuse. According to a report, a relative or acquaintance is involved in child abuse in 80% of cases. Many children are abducted and killed after rape because the abuser fears for arrest after being identified.

Kind behaviour of the Prophet (PBUH) with children: Islam provided a place to children, which is available to other people of society. Islam provides rights to children even before their birth. The rights include life, inheritance, will, trust and maintenance. No other system provides children such comprehensive rights.

Every aspect of the life of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) is accomplished and complete. If we see the treatment of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) with children, we find no one as polite and merciful as Holy Prophet (PBUH) is with children. He said those who do not take pity on young people and respect the elders are not among us. Similarly, he said those who are deprived of politeness, actually they are deprived of all blessings.

Holy Prophet (PBUH) protected the rights of girls, gave them education and emphasised spending on betterment and reformation of girls. So, he said: “One who brings up two girls till their adulthood, he and I will be together on the Day of Judgment.”

Children’s rights, International agreements-abiding country: In November 1989, the UN General Assembly reached an international children agreement. In September 2, 1990, the agreement came into being. This agreement consists of 54 clauses. Among these clauses, 41 clauses are pertaining to children. One-hundred-and-ninety countries have signed this agreement. Pakistan too endorsed the agreement in December 12, 1990.

According the first article of the agreement, a boy and a girl under the age of 18 should be considered a child. The second article of the agreement says a child will not be discriminated for his colour, race, creed, religion, language, country, nationality, tribe or any disability. The 19th article of the agreement says a government shall take measures to protect children from physical, mental, sexual punishment, mistreatment and non-attendance.

The 34th article of the agreement says a child will be protected from any mistreatment, abuse and disgrace and every child will be kept away from any prohibited business.

The article 35th of the agreement says a government along with other countries will establish a system to eliminate child trafficking and business of abducting children.

The 37th article of the agreement says children will be kept safe from cruel treatment, punishment, severe punishments, including death and life term. In June 11, 2011, Pakistan endorsed International Optional Protocol against sale of children, use of children for sex and child phonographic, and after the endorsement of the protocol Pakistan is now bound to take measures to stop such crime against children.

What does Pak law say about child abuse?: According to Pakistan Penal Code, criminals involved in child sexual abuse are given punishment of minimum two-year jail and maximum life term by courts.

In 2016, for the first time in the history of Pakistan, parliament made a law against child sexual assault, making porn films of children, and their trafficking. Under this law, child abuse punishment has been increased from seven years to 10 years in jail.

According to Section 40 of the Act 2004 of Punjab, child abuse will bear three-year jail and Rs 50,000 fine whereas there is no fixation of punishment of child pornographic. Due to this reason, in Kasur videos scandal case anti-terrorism Act 1997 clauses had to be included.

According to KP Act 2010, Section 48, child pornographic bears minimum threes year jail and maximum seven year jail along with fine from Rs 200,000 to 700000 whereas, according to Section 50 of the Act, showing porn movies to children or trying to involve them in sex activities will have seven years jail and heavy fine.

In Kasur video scandal, a case the clauses of Pakistan Penal Code PPC 376 and 277 had to be included because there was no fixation of punishment or law to deal with such crime.

Zainab tragedy in German media: According to the German media analysis, politicians found it as an opportunity of point-scoring against each other after the murder of minor girl Zainab.

Imran Khan attacked Shahbaz Sharif, saying Shahbaz met the parents of Zainab early in the morning just to avoid people’s criticism of his negligence. Former Pakistan president Asif Ali Zardari and other PPP leaders lashed out at the Punjab government and held it responsible for crimes against children in Punjab. Activists of Khadim Rizvi of Tehreek Labaik Ya Rasoolullah reached Kasur and delivered fiery speeches and added fuel to the fire.

Social media: Social media is viewed as the head-fountain of fake news all-over the world. A report in British news media said, people of ‘Socialistan’ are in fix. They don’t know what to do to focus on third marriage of Imran Khan or condemn Kasur incident. These people of ‘Socialistan’ are so angry that they have sent lakhs of tweets of condemnation and demands for hanging the culprits, but these people hardly attend any candle-lit or demonstrations taken out in Karachi and Islamabad against the Kasur incident.",['Rafique Mangat'],"375 million, live in India, and 275 million of them are victims of sexual abuse, placing the country on top of the list of world nations as far as child sexual abuse is concerned.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/567567-resolve-pashtun-women,,The resolve of the Pashtun women,"When women in Peshawar got the news of Women March on ‘International Women’s Day’ from other women on social media, they decided to be a part of it. The Women March, beginning from Hyderabad via Karachi to Lahore and Islamabad, also encouraged women in Peshawar and they urged each other to be a part of it. There was no banner and no organisation to support it but still women were calling on each other with the expectation of presence of a few women. However, they were surprised to see a large crowd of women from different backgrounds gathering at Press Club Peshawar the next day.

Pashtun women came out on roads for the march to emphasise the issues that women are facing at the grassroot level, especially in KP and erstwhile FATA. Pashtun women, who are already a victim of patriarchy and poverty for centuries, are burdened with additional traumas caused by terrorism and the war on terror.

Pashtun women are facing issues which are much more serious than the issues faced by women in the rest of the country and they need serious attention. These issues include patriarchy, poverty and terrorism. They are victims of inhuman customary practices called Riwaj and Swara (forced or compensation marriage to solve a fued), Walwar or Rasnama (a bride price), Ghag (men’s uproar to claim/occupy a woman for marriage without her consent), honour killing to protect the man’s Nang (honour), Miratah (woman without a male member like husband, son, brother or father, etc, so her property is distributed amongst other men of the family).

The financial problems of a Pashtun woman are not addressed who don’t get her inheritance or dowry rights given by the constitution and Islam, especially tribal women who are kept deprived of inheritance in another form called Shamilat (The joint owned property) which is distributed only among men through a custom called Wesh (Distribution). These are some of the core patriarchal practices which are unconstitutional but are still faced by Pashtun women.

There are many other patriarchal issues which are unconstitutional as well but are still in practice like forced marriage and barriers to girls’ education, right to work, right to vote and right to contest election. Representation of Pashtun women in parliament and all forums of decision-making process should be ensured.

Pashtun women need special attention of policy makers and should be kept out of the crowd who are facing patriarchal issues and poverty because they are facing the added burden of trouble caused by terrorism and war on terror for more than a decade. They became widows, orphans and disabled, they were forced to leave their home and became ‘Internally Displaced Persons’ (IDPs). This women march was a great opportunity to bring forth all these issues to the world.

‘Women March’ was an opportunity to draw the attention of policy makers and the whole world towards these issues.",[],"When women in Peshawar got the news of Women March on ‘International Women’s Day’ from other women on social media, they decided to be a part of it.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/610201-police-investigation-is-entry-point-in-criminal-justice-system,,Police investigation is entry point in criminal justice system,"Islamabad : Police are the entry point in the criminal justice system and a door for access to justice. If its core function of investigation is compromised due to political interference, vested interest or corruption coupled with inefficiency, it will surely lead to miscarriage of justice at the door, a experienced police officer, believes in scientific investigation, averred.

A serving senior police officer, while talking to ‘The News’, on the condition of anonymity, conceded that there probably are thousands of innocent individuals, both men and women, young and old, who somehow got implicated in some acts of crime and have been handed out different sentences, even from death to life imprisonment or other terms, only because of flawed investigations.

“We need to hire crime investigation experts who should be trained on scientific lines, using latest forensic sciences for collecting evidence to corroborate the facts in any crime. Similarly, for interrogation purposes we need to hire psychologists and psychiatrists to engage with the alleged criminals instead of using ‘third degree’ tactics,” he added.

“We have seen quite experienced young investigators, who wanted to carry out investigations in any act of crime on scientific basis, using forensics to unveil and unearth evidences and applying human psychology with reasoning to get to the bottom of a case at hand.

“Unfortunately such investigators could not sustain long and with the passage of time, abandoned their actual skills and started following the notorious police investigations prevailing in our police stations since colonial times,” the senior police officer said.

“The traditional practice of investigation is to resort to blackmailing in the form of detention of the close relatives of any alleged criminal and even if it does not work the inhuman violence is what the investigators employ to extract confessional statements,” the police officer supervising the investigation section of the Punjab police department, said, adding that a notable number of inexperienced lot of young investigators, misusing their offices, are practicing old tradition of investigation and misguiding the courts of justice.

As a result, an accused, an overwhelming majority of whom are poor, uneducated individuals, ends up as a ‘proven’ criminal and handed out convictions which range from death by hanging by the neck till death, life imprisonments or other sentences to be served in confinement of jails for years and years for a crime that they have never committed.

There are thousands and thousands of such victims lodged in jails all over the country, awaiting the government to make some meaningful amendments in the prevailing laws, which may help them prove their innocence and get their freedom.

Meanwhile, the former Inspector-General of Police of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Nasir Khan Durrani, pointed out that another major corrupt practice to influence investigations is bribe. “This bribe could start with thou sands of rupees and may end up in multi millions, depending on the severity of case. This financial corruption has frequently impacted investigations, leading to flawed evidence which eventually ends up in weak prosecution,” the former IGP said.

He said that the system of review and revision in the criminal justice system during the course of investigation need to be improved.

“The top most priority of the government should be to change ‘Police Culture’, this ‘Thana-Kutchery culture’ (Police Station and Court culture), completely revamp the police investigation system and separate it from the police department, hire investigation specialists who are abreast with the modern and scientific means and manners of crime investigation and continue training more and more crime investigators in the country,” Nasir Khan Durrani said.

He pointed out that at present the ‘First Information Report’ (FIR) in any case is considered to be the complete case file by the police as well as the judiciary. “This is wrong. The FIR should be considered only as the initial report. At present a whole case is built on the FIR and the changes made in it eventually make the whole thing suspicious. And the courts also consider these FIRs as the basis of any case and because of the faulty investigations the case ends up in a flawed decision,” he said.

About the ‘eye witnesses’ in any case, he said, there is a big importance of eye witness or eye witnesses in any case all over the world. “But the statement of an eye witness or eye witnesses should be brief and authentic in which he or she should narrate only what he or she has seen with his or her own eyes,” he said.

“But in our ‘kutchery and court’ system is overwhelmingly powerful and the touts and mafias have dug their claws too deep in this rotten system. They are openly buying fake professional witnesses who are very well trained to give evidence in the court of law under oath and the judges have no option but to believe their statements and make decision on the basis of those,” the former IGP said.

Another issue, he added, is the credibility of ‘Dying Declaration’, a statement given by a victim just before his or her death. “Usually these ‘Dying Declarations’ are declared not credible on the basis that the dying person could have wrongly implicated somebody for his or her enmity.

Yet another issue is the confessional statements extracted by the use of violence or harassment. “Almost always such statements given by any alleged culprit are denied in the court of law and are set aside by the court as an account taken under duress. So, these are just a few factors, a few of the major factors in fact, which are crippling our investigation and legal system and need to be paid immediate attention with more steps to be introduced for gradual change in the long run,” Nasir Khan Durrani said.

Deputy Inspector General of Police, Asim Gulzar, when contacted to get his belief in investigation skill, said, “Criminal investigations in Pakistan move from criminal to crime scene which ultimately leads to fabrication of evidence, forced confessions, torture and ultimately acquittals or wrong convictions”.

Investigation under Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) is defined as the “Collection of Evidence” which in turn requires use of scientific tools and latest techniques, the DIG maintained.

In order to improve investigations, police must shift its focus on crime scene and use scientific methods, ensure chain of custody procedures and secure he evidence to identify the criminal, Asim Gulzar added.

It is high time that investigative function shall be further developed and only certified investigators must be deputed by law to investigate the cases and in case of motivated or wrong arrests, the investigation officer and the department must face the civil damages suits, he concluded.",['Shakeel Anjum'],"Islamabad : Police are the entry point in the criminal justice system and a door for access to justice.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/613482-high-court-orders-swift-dna-tests-in-rape-and-assault-cases,,High court orders swift DNA tests in rape and assault cases,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Thursday took exception to the standard operating procedure (SOP) of the police for dealing with rape and assault cases, saying that no exact time frame was mentioned for the investigating officers to take DNA samples and getting them tested.

The SHC’s division bench headed by Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar directed the provincial police chief and the home department to convene a meeting to devise a complete mechanism under which IOs or SHOs are not burdened with the cost or demand of bill of DNA tests.

The court said that there must be a system under which after the collection of samples a bill for their tests is sent to the provincial government for payment.

The order came on a contempt application against non-compliance of the court’s directives calling for the home department, district & sessions courts and anti-terrorism courts to ensure arrangements for DNA tests, recording of victims’ statements through teleconference and in-camera trial proceedings in rape and assault cases. The applicant’s counsel said that on January 31 last year the high court had directed Sindh’s police chief and prosecutor general to ensure proper arrangements for conducting DNA tests and in-camera trials in rape and related cases.

He said the alleged contemnors were deliberately violating the court’s directives, adding that the preservation and testing of DNA evidence was sporadic, unregulated and delayed, while the facilities available for DNA tests continued to be severely limited and dysfunctional.

Citing the example of the Jamna rape case in Sujawal, the counsel said the survivor continued to await her DNA test result despite the passage of four months.

Besides, he added, there has been no progress towards conducting rape trials in camera or after court hours, and even child survivors continue to be forced to face their alleged perpetrators in open courtrooms and have to repeatedly suffer until the evidences are recorded.

He said the victims and survivors of rape and assault cases continue to suffer through prejudiced investigations and trials and denial of justice, as the orders for making these trials effective and sensitised to the nature of the offence remain unheeded.

The counsel pointed out that so many DNA test reports were awaited due to non-payment of bills of the laboratories concerned. The court was requested to take action against the alleged contemnors for violating the court’s directives.

Compliance report

Sindh police chief Dr Syed Kaleem Imam submitted a compliance report and said that the police have an SOP for carrying out immediate DNA tests with certain directions to the SHOs and IOs.

Filing details of rape and assault cases, Imam said 575 rape cases were registered in Karachi Range, 585 victims were reported, 493 suspects were nominated and 640 suspects were arrested. He added that 410 cases were pending in different trial courts, where 13 accused were convicted, 47 acquitted and 23 were out on bail.

Regarding Hyderabad Range, he said 134 cases were registered, 106 victims were reported, 273 suspects were nominated and 206 suspects were arrested. He added that 54 cases were pending in different trial courts, where four accused were convicted and 43 were acquitted.

In Sukkur Range, said the police chief, 60 cases were registered, 62 victims were reported, 142 suspects were nominated and 89 suspects were arrested. He added that 35 cases were pending in different trial courts, where one accused was convicted and nine were acquitted.

The court asked why DNA tests were not being conducted on time, observing that no negligence will be tolerated in rape and related cases. The bench said that if investigation in such cases continued to be delayed, the courts will have no other option but to grant bail to the accused.

The SHC asked Imam how rape and related cases can be proved when DNA tests are not being conducted, and how the accused can could be convicted without any evidence.

The court said that no exact time frame was mentioned in the police SOP under which SHOs or IOs are required to forward samples for DNA tests and receive their reports without any delay.

The DIG (legal) informed the bench that the provincial government had recently signed agreements with the University of Karachi and Jamshoro’s University of Sindh for DNA tests, and some payments had also been made for the purpose.

The court said the police and the home department still did not have any mechanism to deal with the situation as to when the IO would forward the sample, if it would be directly received by the university, if they would ask for payment first or if they would send the bill directly to the government.

Inadequate system

Home Secretary Dr Usman Chachar said that some amount had been paid and some would be transferred to an escrow account, but he could not satisfy the court about the procedure under which samples would be received and bills would be sent to the government.

The court directed the home department and the police chief to convene a meeting within three days and devise a complete mechanism for swift DNA tests under which IOs or SHOs are not burdened with the cost or demand of bill.

The bench directed the member of the SHC’s inspection team to implement the court’s directions to the trial courts under which those courts would fix screens for rape and related cases. The high court directed the member inspection team (MIT) to submit a report as to if trial and proceedings in rape and assault cases are being conducted with proper screens.

The bench said the SHC wanted to examine a list of all individual cases pending in courts and the reasons for non-compliance of its directives by the presiding officers of the sessions and anti-terrorism courts.

The court said that if any deficiency was found in the compliance of court directives, the presiding officer of the court concerned will be held responsible to face the consequences and they will have to appear in person to explain their position.

The police chief said they have already sanctioned funds for the investigation, and if they are allowed, they may pay the DNA test fee, so he requested that some directions may be issued to grant this amount as impress money for using it in DNA tests on immediate basis.

The bench said that this aspect will also be considered by the home secretary in the meeting to be convened under the direction of the court.

The judge directed the finance secretary to attend the meeting, and said a compliance report is to be submitted by the home secretary, the police chief and the MIT-II in court on February 27.

Earlier, the additional law secretary had informed the court that the government had amended Section 156(B) and inserted Section 156(C) and 156(D) in the Criminal Procedure Code, making DNA tests in sexual assault cases mandatory.

He said that under the criminal procedure code, DNA tests of rape victims will be mandatorily conducted by police officers through laboratories recognised by the government, and the IO will collect DNA samples from the victims within 72 hours of the incident.

The law department official said the investigation agency will preserve DNA samples and their results at the hospital of the forensic laboratories.

Kainat Soomro and other petitioners had said that the Supreme Court had directed the provincial government and other authorities to reform the investigation process of rape cases, but the directions of the top court were not being complied with. They said rape survivors were unable to get justice due to the faulty process of investigation.

The petitioners, who also cited the provincial police chief and health secretary as respondents in their petition, asked the court to direct them to take immediate steps to improve the investigation system.

They also asked the court to direct the authorities to establish a rape crisis cell in each district of the province to facilitate the survivors in acquiring immediate medical, financial and legal assistance.",['Jamal Khurshid'],"Filing details of rape and assault cases, Imam said 575 rape cases were registered in Karachi Range, 585 victims were reported, 493 suspects were nominated and 640 suspects were arrested.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/716494-government-considering-death-penalty-for-rape-offenders,,Government considering death penalty for rape offenders,"ISLAMABAD: The government is considering various changes in the present set of rape laws to introduce the death penalty for rapists of children and women whose cases involve aggravating factors. It is also considering setting up special courts and making the offence non-compoundable.

A key cabinet member involved in the process ofdrafting these proposals confided to The News that the proposal of chemical castration is also being included but with the caveat that castration will not cure the criminal mindset of the culprit who would still be free to hurt anyone in some other manner.

These proposals, it is said, do not include the option of public hanging but might suggest televising the hanging of such culprits directly from jail to ‘create a deterrence’. However, it is clarified that these proposals are subject to change as they will be first discussed within the PTI in a day or two. They would then be tabled in parliament for discussion and debate before they take final shape as the will of the majority. The set of proposals being prepared include making the offence of rape non-compoundable, which means that the parties concerned cannot reach a compromise to drop the case.

At present, the offence of rape does not carry the death penalty. An amendment is now being proposed that the death penalty will be handed down to the rapists of children. The same punishment of death is being proposed for those who rape women where the rape case includes any of the aggravating factors.

In rape cases where the offender gets a life sentence, it would now mean jail for life or imprisonment till death. In cases where rapists get jail terms for a specific number of years, no remissions would be allowed. Convicted rapists will not be entitled to any kind of remission or pardon.

According to another proposal, rape cases would be investigated by a gazetted police officer, preferably a woman officer. To ensure a speedy trial, there is a suggestion to set up special courts for rape cases.

Rape victims usually find it very traumatic to appear in court. In particular, the cross examination in an open court can be highly embarrassing and distressing for the victim. To help a rape victim defend her case without being subjected to further trauma, it is being proposed that the victim will be cross examined through a video link. The rape survivor will be allowed to cover her face. In the courtroom, only the judge, court staff and lawyers of the two sides would be allowed to witness the proceedings.

The government is considering presenting these proposals before the PTI parliamentary party for discussion and then to table the amendments in parliament by next week. It is also being considered to leave it to the conscience of individual members of parliament to decide which amendments they support rather than voting according to an official line set down by their political party.",['Ansar Abbasi'],"ISLAMABAD: The government is considering various changes in the present set of rape laws to introduce the death penalty for rapists of children and women whose cases involve aggravating factors.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/213108-Syed-Salahuddin-Kashmiris-not-terrorist-Zafar,,"Syed Salahuddin, Kashmiris not terrorist, says Zafar","SRINAGAR: Syed Salahuddin and any Kashmiri pursuing right to self-determination are not terrorist because this right is guaranteed by the UN and Indian leadership, including its first PM late Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru has pledged that soon as normalcy is restored in occupied Jammu and Kashmir people will be asked to express their aspiration about the political destiny of state.

”They will go their way and we will go our way” were the historical words of late Nehru said, Senior Hurriyat leader and Chairman Salvation Movement Zafar Akbar said in an interview with a BBC correspondent.

Akbar, who was under house arrest for last 15 days, expressed his view point during his comments over the statement issued by the US, wherein they have listed Salahuddin as a terrorist.

Zafar disclosed that in 2000 during a brief span of ceasefire between armed wing Hizb ul Mujahedeen and Indian forces, the State Department of US and GOI recognized Hizb ul Mujahedeen and its Supreme Commander Syed Salahuddin as party to dispute when its operational commander late Abdul Majid Dar announced unilateral ceasefire and initiated dialogue with the then home secretary of India Mr. Kamal Pandey at the Nehru Guest House in Srinagar.

How can America or any country contrary to the fact that it is an indigenous movement for peaceful resolution, declare him terrorist.

It was authorities that they accepted him party to the dispute and stressed both India and Pakistan to come forward and start dialogue for permanent resolution of Kashmir dispute, said Zafar.

Liking or disliking is not a parameter or any yardstick and people pursuing an issue which is on the UN agenda have right to press their demands and instead of declaring Salahuddin a terrorist it was better for the US to visit annals of history and look their statements relating to this issue.

The US needs to rethink and send fact-finding mission to Kashmir to ascertain the appalling situation in the disputed territory, said Zafar during his interaction with BBC.

He said that “forces are terrorising Kashmiris while arresting, killings, carrying out massacres, showering pellet and bullets, harrassment, using sexual assault as a weapon of war against women and killing youth through fake encounters are now so rampant that each soul in the state run for safety and feel insecure in highly militarized zone.

Meanwhile, a spokesman for Jammu And Kashmir Salvation Movement strongly condemned the use of force against mourners after Eid prayers in different parts of Kashmir.

He also condemned the restrictions and denounced the curbs on Hurriyat leadership including Zafar Akbar Bhat and said that all these leaders were barred from offering Eid prayers’.",[],"”They will go their way and we will go our way” were the historical words of late Nehru said, Senior Hurriyat leader and Chairman Salvation Movement Zafar Akbar said in an interview with a BBC correspondent.

Meanwhile, a spokesman for Jammu And Kashmir Salvation Movement strongly condemned the use of force against mourners after Eid prayers in different parts of Kashmir.","['late', 'movement', 'way', 'ul', 'terrorist', 'kashmiris', 'kashmir', 'salahuddin', 'zafar', 'syed', 'dispute', 'right', 'nehru']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/num/xge4ox.gif', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/s_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/num/xge2ox.gif', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/mail.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/s_756604_124311_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/image_loader_magzine.gif', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-08/s_755571_054848_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2017-06-27/l_213108_052035_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/s_756928_062945_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-10/s_756528_094020_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-10/s_756521_065131_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/google-plus.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/s_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/s_756933_070734_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/num/xge0ox.gif', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-08/s_755575_063259_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/s_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/s_756924_044951_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/load-more.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/s_756925_055035_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2017-06-27/l_213108_052035_updates.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'Syed Salahuddin, Kashmiris not terrorist, says Zafar | Pakistan | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'SRINAGAR: Syed Salahuddin and any Kashmiri pursuing right to self-determination are not terrorist because this right is guaranteed by the UN and\xa0Indian leadership, including its first PM late...', 'keywords': 'syed,salahuddin,kashmiris,terrorist,zafar', 'fb': {'app_id': 650123461797330}, 'og': {'title': 'Syed Salahuddin, Kashmiris not terrorist, says Zafar', 'image': {'identifier': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2017-06-27/l_213108_052035_updates.jpg', 'secure_url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2017-06-27/l_213108_052035_updates.jpg', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'width': 390}, 'description': 'SRINAGAR: Syed Salahuddin and any Kashmiri pursuing right to self-determination are not terrorist because this right is guaranteed by the UN and\xa0Indian leadership, including its first PM late...', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/213108-Syed-Salahuddin-Kashmiris-not-terrorist-Zafar', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@thenews_intl', 'creator': '@OTHERS', 'title': 'Syed Salahuddin, Kashmiris not terrorist, says Zafar', 'description': 'SRINAGAR: Syed Salahuddin and any Kashmiri pursuing right to self-determination are not terrorist because this right is guaranteed by the UN and\xa0Indian leadership, including its first PM late...', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2017-06-27/l_213108_052035_updates.jpg?t=020630'}, 'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style': 'black-translucent', 'apple-mobile-web-app-title': 'The News International', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#333333', 'theme-color': '#000000'})",[],news
https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/643483-covid-19-and-child-abuse,,Covid-19 and child abuse,"The world has suffered through epidemics and pandemics in the past. Experience tells us that child abuse and neglect increase during such periods.

Apart from increasing mortality and morbidity all over the world, the Covid-19 pandemic will cause mental health problems in some children and will hit hard on children prone to abuse. It is a known fact that children are more vulnerable than adults to suffer heightened emotional distress when their routine life is disrupted by such events. Every child’s reaction is different. Some may show obvious signs of fear and anxiety; others may present as if nothing is happening.

The stress may manifest in them as aggression or reclusion. It is important to understand and validate their feelings. As adults, we sometimes ignore the fact that our children are living in the same environment as us and are trying to decipher the gravity of the situation as best as they can.

Parents and caregivers need to remember that children are good observers – your reaction to stress is their best tool to assess the situation. It is normal for anxiety and stress to develop in an adult when there is uncertainty about the future, but it is abnormal when one is unable to contain it. This may lead to violent behaviour towards children, who are, in general, the most susceptible targets.

We also know that more than 80 percent of the time perpetrators of sexual abuse are someone known to the child. During lockdown, children are home 24 hours or, in the circumstances of a parent contracting an illness, may be sent to relatives and acquaintances, making them even more vulnerable to sexual abuse. Particularly at risk are children who have undergone previous trauma, have mental or physical health problems, have parents who have mental health problems or are at high-risk of emotional disturbance because of current medical, financial and social conditions.

This pandemic is going to significantly affect children’s safety in the country unless we prepare for it and spread awareness at the same level as we are doing for hand washing, social distancing and isolation. Besides keeping them safe from the coronavirus, how can we make sure our children are protected physically and mentally? It is reassuring to know that with the provision of a consistent supportive environment, most children do well.

The most important way is to make them feel safe and secure. This can only be done if the parent or caregiver is feeling secure themselves. It is important to understand that everyone in the world is affected by the pandemic. Some of us are hit harder than others but the feeling of uncertainty is universal. Therefore, the best solution is to focus on what is in our control. Taking care of our own mental well-being is the best gift a parent can give to their child.

Instead of leaving children to interpret the current situation on their own, explain what is happening around them in an age-appropriate way. Do not wait for them to ask questions; be proactive in sitting down with them and asking them about their opinions and concerns of the current environment. Find out if they are worried about their or their family’s safety and if they feel scared, angry or sad. Reassurance that you are there to protect them is invaluably helpful.

Use child-friendly materials on Covid-19 to teach them simple hygiene activities such as proper handwashing technique and using your elbow when sneezing among other measures. This will not only make them feel like they are contributing to positive outcomes but will also make them feel like they are in control of the situation. It is also important to limit their exposure to news, social media and discussions of the pandemic as these are often difficult to process for a child.

Creating routine in the child’s life helps diminish the stress stemming from the chaos outside. While a minority of schools in Pakistan are doing a great job of keeping children busy through virtual classes, a majority of schools are unable to keep in contact with their pupils due to the unavailability of support and resources.

It becomes the parents’ and caregivers’ responsibility to keep children engaged with learning, safe activities and playtime. Some ideas to keep them busy include learning new languages, learning how to play new instruments or learning how to cook. Depending on the availability of the internet, enrolling in free online courses provided by reputable international institutions is also an option. Furthermore, social distancing may have isolated some children from their only source of emotional support – friends or family. It is important for them to stay connected through letters, telephone or video chat.

It is vital to know the whereabouts of your child inside and outside of your house. You should know who your child is with 24 hours of the day. Do not leave them with anyone you do not wholly trust. This is a good time to teach them about safeguarding their body and differentiating between safe and unsafe touches. Internet safety rules should be explained to children who have access to the internet and great care must be taken to see that the rules are being adhered to. Professional help should be sought for children that are going through significant emotional or behavioral changes at any time.

Countries with well-organized child protection services are vigilant and prepared to protect their children in tragedies such as the world is going through. The problem with Pakistan is that we have not yet given importance to the protection of our children. Our systems are broken with no coordination between police, child protection agencies and courts. The helplines are a decorative and hollow shell of a well-functioning system and are unable to provide information beyond self-help. Unchecked population growth, poverty and corruption have constricted Pakistan’s ability to provide basic rights to children as agreed upon in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

In this air of unpredictability, I worry for the child who is a victim of physical abuse by their parent. I worry for the child who is being neglected because of a parent’s mental health. I worry for the child who is being sexually abused by their parents, relatives, teachers or religious instructors under the oblivious eye of their caretaker. I worry for the teenager who is being sexually abused in exchange for money or food. I worry for our child beggars. I worry for our child labourers both domestic and otherwise.

Let’s unite to not only safeguard our own children but every child in Pakistan. This can be done by spreading awareness and informing those who are ignorant and do not take these matters seriously. One can only hope that once this pandemic is over, our country’s leaders will give attention to this vulnerable part of our country too.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-9-19155-Our-narrow-tax-base,,"‘CNG sector, transporters blackmail government’","ISLAMABAD: Adviser to Prime Minister on Petroleum Dr Asim Hussain on Wednesday said that Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) station owners and transporters are hand in glove in blackmailing the government, urging the Supreme Court to take action against the on-strike owners of CNG stations.

Speaking outside the Parliament House, the adviser said that the Supreme Court had ordered the owners of CNG stations to decrease the prices and now it should order them to reopen their stations.

He said the government had sealed several on-strike CNG stations across the country but the crisis of the gas was increasing with the passage of time.He said the owners of the CNG stations were violating the orders of the Supreme Court and the government was ready to take action against them again, if the apex court gave orders in this regard.

Dr Asim said CNG stations’ strike had hit the public transport due to which the passengers were facing trouble.Meanwhile, during a meeting of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Petroleum and Natural Resources that met here with Engineer Tariq Khattak in the chair, Dr Asim Hussain said that equitable tax would be imposed on the CNG in a bid to make it more equitable with petrol to gradually phase out CNG.

During the meeting legislative body expressed its concerns over closure of CNG stations and prevailing disagreement over price mechanism between Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and CNG association. Legislators were of the view that Ogra and CNG association were stiff over their stances while common man has been forced to stay in long queues for hours to get fuel for the vehicles.

Dr Asim Hussain informed the committee that actual CNG gas price is Rs35.19 and CNG stations were charging Rs20.80 merely in operational cost. Gas Infrastructure Development Surcharge (GIDC) is Rs13 and General Sales Tax (GST) on CNG is Rs12.10.

“The government is committed to gradually phase out CNG from the country as we do not

have sufficient gas reserves in the country,” the adviser said, adding that the government is devising a policy for said purpose.

He also criticised the role of Ogra as regulator and said that being a regulatory Ogra has been failed to deliver.Lawmaker Rana Afzal Hussain remarked that CNG association has become a cartel and they looted the innocent people of the country and minted million of rupees from consumers.

He said that assurance of hundred percent profit over business is beyond understanding, no one can under stand that CNG mafia is being facilitated. Standing committee handed over this issue to the sub-committee working under the chairmanship of Jamshed Dasti and directed to submit its report immediately.

The standing committee resented the explosions of CNG cylinders in the vehicles and said that performance of explosive department was nil.Dr Asim Hussain said that the explosive department is under the control of Ministry of Industries where they get bribes and after filling forms give laboratory certificates.

The woman from Karachi and her four-year-old daughter were subjected to brutal gang-rape by two accused in the Kashmore district after the woman was lured to the Sindh-Balochistan border district for a job, police said.

Prof Jamal Raza maintained that the injuries of the victim child were serious and highly infected, adding she was initially examined by the surgical team at the operation theatre. He said the wounds were cleaned and managed. “There is evidence of contamination and severe infection for which medications are being given. There is no urgent surgical procedure required now and we will try to control the infections and review the situation,” he added.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/718924-salient-features-of-draft-anti-rape-act-2020,,Salient features of draft Anti Rape Act 2020,"ISLAMABAD: The draft Anti Rape (Investigation & Prosecution) Act 2020, presented before the cabinet on Tuesday, proposes the death penalty for gang rape offenders as well as for the offence of rape with the intention of murder.

The draft law does not include the provision of public hanging of rapists despite Prime Minister Imran Khan's statement that he wants to make an example of rapists by hanging them in public. A presentation on the draft law by the prime minister’s advisor on interior Barrister Shahzad Akbar also suggested chemical castration for convicts having a past history of sexual offences and seven to 14 years imprisonment for an attempt to rape. All these offences are recommended to be made non-compoundable, non-bailable and cognizable.

The salient features of the proposed law include gender sensitive investigations and prosecution; a comprehensive definition of ‘rape’ and ‘consent’; the setting up of special courts; protection of the victim’s identity; person defined as children, male, female or transgender; in-camera trial and recording of evidence through video link; exemplary punishments such as chemical castration; monitoring by the National Commission on Status of Women and constitution of Rape Crises Cells; rehabilitation and provision of legal aid to victims and psychological rehabilitation of convicts. Rape Crises Cells at the federal, provincial and district levels will be headed by female policer officers of BS 21, BS 20 and BS 18 respectively.

For investigation into rape cases, the proposed law suggests the appointment of female investigation officers of BPS 17 or above who will be provided gender sensitive training.Investigation will be completed within 30 days. A registry of sex offenders will also be compiled.

For speedy and effective prosecution, the draft law suggests the establishment of special courts and the appointment of public prosecutors and female presiding officers. Rape case trials will be concluded within 45 days. The proceedings of rape cases will be in-camera to ensure the victim’s identity remains anonymous; there will be a punishment for revealing the victim's identity. During the trial, evidence of witnesses and victims will be conducted via video link.

The proposed law has been referred to the legislative committee of the cabinet. Following the recent Lahore Motorway incident, the prime minister had announced that severe punishments will be included in the present law to make an example of rapists. The premier had assigned his Advisor on Interior Barrister Shahzad Akbar to propose a new law to check the growing incidents of the rape of women, children and transgender persons in the country.",['Ansar Abbasi'],"ISLAMABAD: The draft Anti Rape (Investigation & Prosecution) Act 2020, presented before the cabinet on Tuesday, proposes the death penalty for gang rape offenders as well as for the offence of rape with the intention of murder.

The proposed law has been referred to the legislative committee of the cabinet.","['proposed', 'public', 'draft', 'rapists', 'female', 'features', 'anti', 'prosecution', '2020', 'law', 'rape', 'victims', 'act', 'prime', 'salient']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/TNS-logo.png?v=1', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/700X390_thenews.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/reporters/224_031214_reporter.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756938_110007_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756950_013152_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756942_121550_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756952_014708_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-09-23/718924_6251612_rape2_akhbar.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/pause-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/Thenews-logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756935_084724_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756943_124422_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756941_010811_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-09-23/l_718924_054112_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756937_095203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756936_091737_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/whatsapp_dark.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756939_124339_updates.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/sms.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/close_black.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/drop-down.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/mosque-icon.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/front/images/play-news.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-11/ss_756940_114928_updates.jpg'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-09-23/l_718924_054112_updates.jpg,1,TRUE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'TITLE': 'Salient features of draft Anti Rape Act 2020 | Top Story | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'ISLAMABAD: The draft Anti Rape  Act 2020, presented before the cabinet on Tuesday, proposes the death penalty for gang rape offenders as well as for the offence of rape with the intention of...', 'keywords': 'salient,features,draft,anti,rape,2020', 'fb': {'app_id': 650123461797330}, 'og': {'title': 'Salient features of draft Anti Rape Act 2020', 'image': {'identifier': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-09-23/l_718924_054112_updates.jpg', 'secure_url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-09-23/l_718924_054112_updates.jpg', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'width': 390}, 'description': 'ISLAMABAD: The draft Anti Rape  Act 2020, presented before the cabinet on Tuesday, proposes the death penalty for gang rape offenders as well as for the offence of rape with the intention of...', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/718924-salient-features-of-draft-anti-rape-act-2020', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@thenews_intl', 'creator': '@Ansar Abbasi', 'title': 'Salient features of draft Anti Rape Act 2020', 'description': 'ISLAMABAD: The draft Anti Rape  Act 2020, presented before the cabinet on Tuesday, proposes the death penalty for gang rape offenders as well as for the offence of rape with the intention of...', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2020-09-23/l_718924_054112_updates.jpg?t=015257'}, 'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style': 'black-translucent', 'apple-mobile-web-app-title': 'The News International', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#333333', 'theme-color': '#000000'})",[],news

It has been learnt that so far three teachers and four students have been tested positive. Teachers and students have expressed lots of reservations about the downplaying of threats by the management as it is trying to hide the cases.

Students and teachers are using the same transport, thus raising the concerns of contracting virus from each other. A couple of students from Cambridge section have been infected. While that section has gone online with students asked to attend classes through zoom, the siblings of infected students in primary section have been allowed to attend classes in college, raising concerns among parents of other students and teachers.

While students are coming on alternate days to attend the classes, the principal has increased the working hours of the college employees, putting them at the high risk.

Contrary to this, most of the educational institutions of Islamabad are taking live classes for 4 days with 2 days online classes in order to give its employees a relief in the present circumstances.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/621154-marrying-young,,Marrying young: Impact of early marriages on girls physical and mental growth,"It was heartbreaking to hear Shazia remember the 11 years she was not allowed to meet her mother. When she was finally allowed, the mother did not have long to live. It was because at age 13 or perhaps 14, Shazia was married to a man who was 60 years old at that time and had paid her family Rs60,000 for the transaction with an explicit undertaking that she would not meet her family for 10 years. She remembers the excitement on seeing her sister’s mother-in-law in the city she had moved to and, her subsequent meeting with her brother in a secret meeting. Shazia’s father was not an evil tyrant but he had to give away Shazia to pay for the dowry of his elder daughter, who was being pressured for items beyond their capacity. She says her extremely poor eyesight is a consequence of her constantly crying for her family. The first physical contact with her husband nearly bled her to death, prompting the doctor (who the husband was kind enough to call for a home visit) to prohibit her husband from any further interaction till she healed (two to three months). Shazia’s husband did not force her but, how many child brides are that fortunate?

Child marriage according to global standards is marriage below the age of 18 years. All child marriages are not only illegal because of violation of the minimum age of marriage, but are also forced and hence attract legislative penalties under Section 310-A of the Pakistan Penal Code. 310-A enforces a minimum punishment of 3 years imprisonment and a fine of Rs 500,000 for forcing a female into marriage and there are also penalties for breach of the minimum marriage age of 16 and 18, respectively for boys and girls in the Punjab, the KPK and Balochistan. Sindh has legislated a uniform age of 18 for both girls and boys. An attempt was also made in 2019, led by Senator Sherry Rehman to increase the minimum age of marriage for girls to 18 in ICT but certain political parties blocked the bill.

When poverty-stricken parents receive a generous stipend for their girl’s education, their incentive to marry them off is significantly reduced.

While the law gives the minimum age of 16, there is no real mechanism to confirm the age of the bride due to poor documentation of vital registrations for girls. Their births are not registered in many areas of Pakistan and the abysmal 50 percent literacy rate means that nearly half the women will not even have school certificates to ascertain their age. The law requires the nikah registrar (marriage registration officials) to confirm the age of marriage but lack of documents and social norms prevent the male nikah registrars from checking the bride’s documents or even make a visual guess. Raising the minimum age of marriage for girls to 18 will plug a big hole in this poor implementation of the law, by making CNIC the basis for age verification. Along with legislation raising the age of marriage, we also need to ensure nikah registrars understand the law and their responsibilities. A recent effort by the Punjab government to provide training to nearly 39,000 male nikah registrars demonstrated that 50 percent were not aware of the legislative amendments in 2012 and 2015 and, nearly 70 percent had not received any training/orientation to the law.

Marriage is considered to be a mithaq, a solemn covenant or agreement between husband and wife, and enjoined by The Quran [4:21]. Since no agreement can be reached between parties unless they are able to give free consent, how can minors (those under the age of 18) have the capacity to enter a contract. Unfortunately, despite national laws and international commitments, child/forced marriage remains a real threat for many in Pakistan. According to the Pakistan Demographic and Household Survey (PDHS 2017-18), 8 percent of women age 15-19 are pregnant with the first child or are already mothers. Accurate figures for child marriages are not available due to the practice of verbal marriage solemnization, non-registration and misrepresentation of age at marriage.

Child brides are often expected to bear children soon after marriage, which makes them vulnerable to pregnancy and childbirth related complications. It is recognised that girls who are married between the ages of 10-14 are five times more likely to die in childbirth than women aged 15-19. Child marriage is also the major cause of high maternal mortality ratio of 140 per 100,000 live births (Index mundi). The World Health Organization reports that pregnancy complications remain the leading cause of death among girls aged 15 to 19 in countries with low- and middle-income countries accounting for 99 percent of global maternal deaths of women aged 15–49 years. Babies born to young mothers are also at greater risk: each year about 1 million babies born to adolescent girls die before their first birthday. In developing countries, if a mother is under 18, her baby’s chance of dying during the first year of life is 60 percent higher than a baby born to a mother older than 19. Another very serious consequence associated with early childbirth is obstetric fistula, a condition that causes chronic incontinence and occurs commonly in young girls who give birth before their bodies have matured. It causes constant, uncontrollable leaking of urine or feces, relegating the suffering women to a leper’s life.

Welcome measures of the governments and of the civil society organizations since the past decade to invest in girl’s education and to raise awareness of the harmful consequences of early marriages have led to reduction in the incidence of marriages below the ages of 16. When poverty-stricken parents receive a generous stipend for their girl’s education, their incentive to marry them off is significantly reduced. According to PDHS women with high school education marry 6.2 years later than women with no education

A uniform minimum age of 18 years for marriage of girls and boys will be a step towards promoting girl’s education, physical health and mental wellbeing. Older females are better prepared to take on the responsibilities of wifehood and motherhood. The Quran enjoins to “Do not dogmatically follow the status-quo and tradition; be open to new ideas” (22:1; 26:5; 38:7).

When poverty-stricken parents receive a generous stipend for their girl’s education, their incentive to marry them off is significantly reduced.","['mental', 'child', 'marrying', 'husband', 'minimum', 'impact', 'pakistan', 'education', 'early', 'growth', 'marriage', '18', 'marriages', 'girls', 'women', 'age', 'young', 'physical']","{'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/image_loader_magzine.gif', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/mail.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/images/print.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk//assets/uploads/tns/2020-03-01/621154_4404003_TNS-18_tns.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/detail-whatsapp.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/tns/2020-03-01/621154_010443_tns.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/logo.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/detail-facebook.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/thenews.png', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/search_top.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/detail-twitter.svg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/tns/2020-12-06/s_753620_052034_tns.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/tns/2020-12-06/s_753621_052209_tns.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/tns/2020-12-06/s_753619_051838_tns.jpg', 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/magazine/tns/images/drop-down.png'}",TRUE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/tns/2020-03-01/621154_010443_tns.jpg,1,FALSE,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0', 'TITLE': 'Marrying young: Impact of early marriages on girls physical and mental growth | Dialogue | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'As the debate on early marriages continues, its impact on the physical and mental growth of girls must be highlighted', 'keywords': 'marrying,young,impact,early,marriages,girls,physical,mental,growth', 'og': {'title': 'Marrying young: Impact of early marriages on girls physical and mental growth | Dialogue | thenews.com.pk', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/tns/2020-03-01/621154_010443_tns.jpg', 'description': 'As the debate on early marriages continues, its impact on the physical and mental growth of girls must be highlighted', 'url': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/621154-marrying-young'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@TheNewsonSunday', 'creator': 'Fauzia Viqar', 'title': 'Marrying young: Impact of early marriages on girls physical and mental growth | Dialogue | thenews.com.pk', 'description': 'As the debate on early marriages continues, its impact on the physical and mental growth of girls must be highlighted', 'image': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/tns/2020-03-01/621154_010443_tns.jpg'}})",[],news
https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/678617-house-passes-sweeping-police-overhaul-after-floyd-s-death,,House passes sweeping police overhaul after Floyd’s death,"WASHINGTON: The House approved a far-reaching police overhaul from Democrats on Thursday, a vote heavy with emotion and symbolism as a divided Congress struggles to address the global outcry over the deaths of George Floyd and other Black Americans, foreign media reported.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gathered with members of the Congressional Black Caucus on the Capitol steps, challenging opponents not to allow the deaths to have been in vain or the outpouring of public support for changes to go unmatched. But the collapse of a Senate Republican bill leaves final legislation in doubt.

“Exactly one month ago, George Floyd spoke his final words — ‘I can’t breathe’ — and changed the course of history,” Pelosi said. She said the Senate faces a choice “to honor George Floyd’s life or to do nothing.”

The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is perhaps the most ambitious set of proposed changes to police procedures and accountability in decades. Backed by the nation’s leading civil rights groups, it aims to match the moment of demonstrations that filled streets across the nation. It has almost zero chance of becoming law.

On the eve of the vote, President Donald Trump’s administration said he would veto the bill. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has also said it would not pass the Republican-held chamber.

After the GOP policing bill stalled this week, blocked by Democrats, Trump shrugged. “If nothing happens with it, it’s one of those things,” Trump said. “We have different philosophies.”

Congress is now at a familiar impasse despite protests outside their door and polling that shows Americans overwhelmingly want changes after the deaths of Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others in interactions with law enforcement.

The two parties are instead appealing to voters ahead of the fall election, which will determine control of the House, Senate and White House. “We hear you. We see you. We are you,” said Rep.

Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., during the debate It has been a month since Floyd’s May 25 death sparked a global reckoning over police tactics and racial injustice. Since then, funeral services were held for Rayshard Brooks, a Black man shot and killed by police in Atlanta. Thursday is also what would have been the 18th birthday of Tamir Rice, a Black boy killed in Ohio in 2014.

Lawmakers who have been working from home during the COVID-19 crisis were summoned to the Capitol for an emotional, hourslong debate. Dozens voted by proxy under new pandemic rules.

During the day, several Democratic lawmakers read the names of those killed, shared experiences of racial bias and echoed support of Black Lives Matter activists.

Rep. Karen Bass, DCalif., the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said hundreds of thousands of people “in every state in the union” are marching in the streets to make sure Floyd “will not be just another Black man dead at the hands of the police.”

Republican lawmakers countered the bill goes too far and failed to include GOP input. “All lives matter,” said Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz. New York Rep. Pete King said it’s time to stand with law enforcement, the “men and women in blue.” House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy decried the “mob” of demonstrators.",['News Report'],"But the collapse of a Senate Republican bill leaves final legislation in doubt.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/419727-government-urged-to-pass-law-on-child-marriages,,Government urged to pass law on child marriages,"PESHAWAR: The civil society organisations and human right activists have urged the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to table and pass the pending legislation of Child Marriage Restraint Amendment Bill, 2018 and raise the minimum age of marriage to 18 without any delay.

Speaking at a joint press conference at Peshawar Press Club, they highly appreciated the landmark step of the Saudi’s Shura Council setting the best example and making it an illegal for girls’ under15 years to get married. They said according to media sources Saudi Arabia’s Shura Council, the top advisory body to the government, in a remarkable move has approved with the majority regulations for banning the marriage in Saudi Arabia under the age of 15 and proposed to increase the minimum age of marriage to 18 for girls and boys. According to a UNICEF report, they said 3 percent of girls in Pakistan were married before they turn 15 and 21 percent before the age of 18. They said the recent research ‘Demographics of child marriages in Pakistan’ (WHO), states that mostly child marriages are in practice in rural areas than in urban areas and more than 140 million girls will marry between 2011 and 2020. According to the recent “Health and Demographic Survey of Pakistan 2017 -2018 almost15 percent of child brides in KP gave birth to their first child before 18 years of age.

Qamar Naseem, Programme Coordinator, Blue Veins and Coordinator for Provincial Alliance to End Child Marriages, appreciated the decision of Saudi Shura Council and said that “proposing the raise in age of marriage to 18 is a great step forward and sets a revolutionary example for other Muslim countries that have not banned child marriage yet.” He said that early and forced marriage violated human rights as well as the sanctity of marriage and family in Islam.

“It is time to open up dialogue on the role of faith and religion in protecting the rights of girls and women and how faith can help prevent a child, early and forced marriages,” he added. Valerie Khan, Chairperson, Group Development Pakistan and a prominent child rights activist, said the child marriage was a harmful practice and had destructive effects on physical and mental health of contracting parties.",['Bureau Report'],"PESHAWAR: The civil society organisations and human right activists have urged the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to table and pass the pending legislation of Child Marriage Restraint Amendment Bill, 2018 and raise the minimum age of marriage to 18 without any delay.

Disgraced American actor Kevin Spacey is facing another lawsuit over sexual assault by actor Anthony Rapp and an anonymous man.

According to court papers, Rapp and the other accuser are alleging the House of Cards star of sexually assaulting them when they were 14.

Rapp, star of Star Trek: Discovery, had earlier opened up about the alleged encounter in 2017, saying Spacey had made unsolicited sexual advances towards him while he was only 14.



Filed on Wednesday, the lawsuit states that he met the ill-famed actor in 1986 while he was performing for Broadway’s Precious Sons, after which Spacey had invited him for a party at his Manhattan residence for a party.

Rapp further details in the Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit that the accused “intentionally and voluntarily and without plaintiff’s consent engaged in an unwanted sexual advance with a 14 year old and grabbed then infant plaintiff.”

The docs reveal how Rapp ran towards the bathroom and following a few minutes, headed for the exit before the actor “tried to persuade plaintiff to stay but plaintiff refused and quickly left the defendant’s apartment.”

The other alleged victim, who is going under the pseudonym of C.D. claims he and Spacey met while he was only 12 during an acting class that was being taught by him in 1981 in Westchester County.

Spacey invited C.D. to his apartment two years later where, the plaintiff recalls, he “engaged in sexual acts with plaintiff, C.D., while the plaintiff was 14 years old.”

As per the docs, the sexual encounters continued “on different occasions.”

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/247076-us-mom-details-brutality-at-hands-of-taliban-faction,,US mom details brutality at hands of Taliban faction,"NEW YORK: A US mother held hostage by Taliban-linked militants for five years has detailed the violence and sexual assault she endured in captivity, and said her young son was also beaten.

""This was an intolerable situation for a child to be in,"" Caitlan Coleman Boyle, 31, told ABC News in a television interview broadcast Monday.

Boyle gave birth to three children in captivity. She and her Canadian husband were abducted by the Haqqani network while travelling through a remote area of Afghanistan -- for reasons that remain unclear -- in 2012.

The family were released last month in Pakistan in circumstances that are also unclear, and are now trying to rebuild their lives in Canada.

Pakistan´s military has said it rescued the family while some US and Canadian officials have reportedly described their release as a ""negotiated handover.""

Boyle said their guards ""could be very violent, even sometimes with the children,"" assaulting their now four-year-old son with a stick, and hitting her and her husband.

""I would get beaten or hit or thrown on the ground,"" she told ABC News. She broke a cheekbone and three fingers while intervening to protect the children, her husband, Joshua Boyle, 34, told ABC.

They made toys out of bottle caps and bits of cardboard, and fearing the family could be beheaded, they made up a game based on England´s Charles I, who was executed in 1649, and Oliver Cromwell, she said.

""Obviously with people like this, the idea of a beheading is always on the table, so he certainly knew that this type of thing could happen to his family but then we would come up with games to make it not seem so scary,"" she said.

""He had great fun pretending to be Oliver Cromwell and chasing Charles I around and trying to behead him,"" she said. ""We made it a game so that he wasn´t afraid.""

After the family returned to Canada last month, Boyle, 34, accused his kidnappers of murdering an infant daughter through a ""forced abortion"" and of raping his wife.

""They came into the cell, and they took my husband out forcefully, dragging him out, and one of the guards threw me down on the ground, hitting me and shouting ´I will kill you, I will kill you´"" his wife told ABC News.

""And that´s when the assault happened. It was with two men. And then there was a third at the door. And afterwards, the animals wouldn´t even give me back my clothes.""",[],"""This was an intolerable situation for a child to be in,"" Caitlan Coleman Boyle, 31, told ABC News in a television interview broadcast Monday.

—- the pathetic state of Karachi after the heavy rains and how it speaks volumes of the state of the poor governance by the provincial government. People say instead of pointing fingers at the federal government and indulging in petty politics of the blame game, the provincial government should get its act together and solve the problems of the poor citizens who have to live in appalling conditions, surrounded by sewage water and filth while their elected representatives live in comfort.

—- the repeated directives of those in authority that cattle markets will operate under strict SOPs and how this sounds good in the media but is not doable in practice as the general public is not willing to follow guidelines and the governments writ is zero. People say besides the cattle markets, which operate during the day, small herds of cows, goats and even camels are seen at night in remote spots as there are no security personnel to control their influx.

—- how the word ‘demand’ is used by protesters from all sections of society and even the media, instead of using words that have a more appealing sound that does not raise the hackles of the authorities they are protesting against. People say the difference between ‘demand’ and, for instance, ‘request’ or ‘appeal’ makes a world of difference and could lead the authorities to consider the problems of protesters and find a solution, rather than have a standoff or strike.

—- media reports that the NA committee held a meeting to probe into the sale or joint venture option (JVO) of PIA’s Hotel Roosevelt and the confrontation it caused between the government and the opposition. People say it is important that the government of Pakistan wait for the market to stabilise before finalising the JVO, while ensuring that the individual appointed by them to head PIA Investments Limited (PIAIL) is a person of integrity and does not hold any dual nationality to evade accountability.—-

—- the shocking news that a Buddha statue discovered during construction activity in KP’s Mardan district was smashed into pieces on Saturday by locals and how it shows the extent of ignorance prevalent in certain areas. People say the statue was discovered while digging for construction was taking place and the locals took sledgehammers and destroyed a valuable artifact that could have been an additional tourist attraction of Buddhist culture and heritage if it had been preserved.

—- the plan to extend Rawalpindi city and how it does not appeal to old timers who feel the city is already overextended since it first came into being, gobbling up all the arable and scenic land near its precincts and making a concrete jungle of one of the prettiest cities in Pakistan. People say if development of this type was necessary, planning a completely new town in an area where the ground was not useful for growing food would have been a better option. — I.H.",[],"—- the practice of ‘Karo Kari’ - a formal term used for honor killing mainly in Sindh.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/193058-Missing-girl-student-has-joined-Daesh-claim-police,,"Missing girl student has joined Daesh, claim police","KARACHI: Hyderabad Police believe that the missing girl student of second year of Liaquat University of Medical Science (LUMS), Jamshoro, has intentionally joined a terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), commonly known as Daesh.

According to the sources of law enforcing agencies, around one dozen girl students of high profile educational institutions missing recently from different areas of the province were believed to have joined Daesh.

A student of LUMS Noreen Jabbar Laghari went missing on February 10, 2017. SSP Hyderabad Irfan Baloch informed the media that the young girl was inspired by the ideology of Daesh and went to join them on her own.

He added that the young girl Noreen Leghari has shared his radical religious views on social media. Police have obtained a video, which showed the girl left for Lahore alone on the day she had gone missing and then contacted her family through social media that she had reached the land of Khilafat.

Noreen Laghari is the daughter of Dr Abdul Jabbar Leghari, Professor at Dr M A Kazi Institute of Chemistry, University of Sindh. Professor Jabbar Laghari said that his daughter left home for university on February 10 and attended morning classes; afterward, she was seen nowhere.

Rejecting the claims of Hyderabad Police and other LEAs, Professor Leghari said his daughter was not of so radical views that she could leave home and join a terrorist organisation. She might have been kidnapped.

As traditional family parents, they first avoided to mention the issue in the media but registered a missing report at Police Station Hussainabad of Hyderabad, which was now converted into a First Information Report.

According to the police sources, the missing girl’s mobile phone was traced in the area of Agricultural Complex, Wahdat Colony of Hyderabad. This raised a question that if she had left for Lahore willingly then who possessed his cell phone. Call record on her number is clear as she hadn’t called any unknown number.

Investigators of the case exclusively told The News that Noreen Leghari had shared some highly radical religious material at her social media page and her said social media page was blocked by the administration of that page. Her father was informed by an officer of a law enforcing agency regarding the activities of her daughter and suggested him to control the situation and keep strict watch on his daughter’s activities.

These sources further said that there are many organised groups of banned terrorist organizations working in different educational institutions of the province, convincing and using students for their ulterior motives.",['Imdad Soomro'],"KARACHI: Hyderabad Police believe that the missing girl student of second year of Liaquat University of Medical Science (LUMS), Jamshoro, has intentionally joined a terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), commonly known as Daesh.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/291417-inefficiency-corruption-smears-police-department,,"Inefficiency, corruption smears police department","ISLAMABAD: The overall performance of police has touched the lowest ebb with hardly any interest being shown by the government or by the department itself to arrest the rot first and then take steps to revive the actual spirit of policing.

It may sound harsh and sort of a sweeping statement but unfortunately this is an undeniable fact that the priorities of a vast majority of our ‘Police Service of Pakistan’ (PSP) officers have completely changed from policing to self projection and money minting.

Gone are the days when the corrupt or dishonest police officers used to get immediately spotted and marked and would be described as the ‘black sheep’ of the department by their own brethren in uniform.

Now are the days that if we find an honest and upright officer we immediately start eulogising him despite the fact that he (or she) are not doing anything extraordinary but only performing their duties with a noticeable level of honesty and dedication.

Similarly, the command has been ignoring their real responsibilities, preparing the lot of professional, dedicated, honest and responsible police officers to lead the force to the grassroots level and may eventually change the infamous and dreaded ‘thana culture’.

And amidst the prevailing environments, made murkier by the political confusion in the country, the inefficiency and corruption in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Police Department is going un-noticed. Simply, because the evils of corruption, nepotism, dishonesty and abuse of power have dug their claws too deep in our society.

With obvious political influence on the department the ‘check and balance system’ for monitoring the performance of officials and officers have faltered badly, eventually reflecting adversely on the crime control and maintenance of law and order situation in the federal capital.

It has been observed that some Station House Officers (SHOs), the Sub-Divisional Police Officers (SDPOs), the Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASPs) and the Superintendent of Police SPs) are not coming up to the set standards of efficiency in the performances of their duties.

The situation has created a disgruntled element in the force as they feel that they are not being awarded and rewarded for their good work while looking helplessly at their colleagues with shady and questionable service records being patronised because of political influence and clout they have mustered up.

There are some officers who simply don’t want to serve in the federal capital any longer and would feel too happy to be transferred to the Punjab or other provinces (except Balochistan). This element in the force has added to the inefficiency of Islamabad Police as well.

When Dr Sultan Azam Temuri took over the charge of the Islamabad Police as the Inspector General, it was anticipated that the things will turn around for betterment and a positive change will be induced in the force that would reflect positively on the crime control and maintenance of law and order situation in the federal capital.

However, these anticipations and expectations have been evaporating gradually. Being a seasoned officer of police service with a lot of experience and exposure, both at national as well as international level, it was expected that Dr Sultan Azam Temuri will induce a chance.

There are still high hopes pinned on him that he will change the prevailing ‘Thana Culture’, which has crept in the federal territory from Punjab and has become so rotten that to change it has become a slogan for the political parties who are openly promising to change this ‘thana culture’ in their rallies.

Surprisingly, while the politicians are promising that if elected to power they will change this ‘Thana Culture’, the department itself seems oblivious of the fact that they have been swallowed up by this evil and they really do need a change in their domain.

Conceded that it has taken decades of direct political intervention in the Police department affairs to change it into what it has turned into today.

Also conceded that that this political intervention is not confined to the Police department all over the country but almost every department has been manipulated by the politicians for their own gains instead of serving the public and the state.

But the undeniable fact is that it is the police department which has lost its sanctity and prestige having become a tool in the hands of a few politicians instead of trying to act like an institution of the state which is meant for serving public and ensure their welfare and wellbeing.

However, at the same time we have seen individuals in the same police department who had refused to budge to the pressure mounted by the politicians and had left highly appreciable impressions by improving the performance, thus winning the hearts and minds of public. We do realize that such a change cannot be induced overnight or even over a considerable period of time, counting in years. But what we expect is for the police bosses to see the reality and realize how compellingly essential it has become to take the right steps in the right direction, first to arrest the deterioration and then to eventually reach the goal.

We know that Dr Sultan Azam Temuri doesn’t carry a ‘magic wand’ that he will wave with a flourish and the things will change. We don’t expect him to turn the Islamabad Police into a model police force in the country overnight. But what pains us to note is that he has yet to take the right steps in the right direction to achieve what he has promised and what he is actually supposed to do as the leader of the Islamabad Police force.

On the contrary, a few directions he gave to the force only encouraged the corrupt and unscrupulous elements in the force to start abuse their powers with impunity. We have all the reasons to believe that he had issued those directions with all the good will behind those. But unfortunately the result is that the old culture of harassing poor public and extortion by patrolling police officials on the roads and in the streets is creeping back.

These incidents, occurrence of which is growing at an alarming rate are, very obviously, not reported anywhere. But we know that it is happening. Apparently he is not being kept abreast with the reality on the ground by those around him in the department who should have been working as his ‘eyes and ears’.

At this stage we are in dire need of officers like Zulfiqar Cheema and Nasir Khan Durrani, who never compromised on the principals, astutely confronted the political pressure and brought about a change in the force under their direct control, creating small islands of honesty and integrity wherever they went to serve. But the best contribution they made towards Pakistan Police was that they nurtured and groomed a team of honest, dedicated and upright police officers, some of which are still working somewhere in the country challenging and confronting the prevalent dishonest system.

Now is the time that we need more and more of such officer who wrote history of policing and honesty in the department.",['Shakeel Anjum'],"And amidst the prevailing environments, made murkier by the political confusion in the country, the inefficiency and corruption in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Police Department is going un-noticed.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/543511-50-women-28-men-killed-for-honour-in-sindh-this-year,,"‘50 women, 28 men killed for ‘honour’ in Sindh this year’","KARACHI : At least 50 women were killed this year in different parts of Sindh under Karo-Kari, while 28 men were also murdered in ‘honour’ killing.

This information was revealed by Abdul Khaliq Shaikh, the DIG headquarter Sindh Police, in his presentation at a consultation on Karo-Kari, titled ‘Karo-Kari/Honour Killing — A Crime Against Humanity; Reasons and Challenges in Stopping the Menace’, held by the Sindh Human Rights Commission (SHRC) at a local hotel.

The purpose of the event was to address the menace of honour killings in the wake of the recent rise in such incidents across the province. A panel comprised of federal and provincial lawmakers, and members of the civil society, judiciary and law enforcement agencies discussed the issue and suggested solutions to deal with it.

DIG Shaikh said the Sindh police had been focusing on the prevention of honour killings and it had formed an anti-honour crime cell in this regard. “We have previously set up a database, trained over 2,000 officers, developed a training manual, and also developed a separate manual for violence against women.”

The officer added that the police department had recently formed a human rights cells, as well as human rights desks in every district, along with setting up a network against gender-based violence in collaboration with civil society.

Nafisa Shah, an MNA of the Pakistan Peoples Party and the author of ‘Honour Unmasked’, said modernisation and reforms within the formal state and justice system were required to deal with the issue of honour killing. “The case [of honour killings] does not exist outside the state, the courtroom is implicated, the law is implicated and the criminal justice system is deeply implicated… The idea of restorative justice becomes strong when investigation systems and criminal justice systems are weak,” she said.

Nafisa said that even though the aspect of culture and customs could not be ignored when one talked about honour killings, our criminal justice system was in a dire need of reforms and the so-called garb of Islamisation had had a lot of impact on our criminal justice procedures.

SHRC Chairperson Justice (retd) Majida Razvi spoke about the sufferings of women and young girls within the province, especially cruelties inflicted on them in the name of honour. She was of the view that the issue of honour killing was a matter of urgency, which needed to be dealt with in consultation with all the stakeholders. She also highlighted the lack of implementation of laws in this regard.

Justice (retd) Shaiq Usmani, former chief justice of the Sindh High Court, said Karo-Kari had a cultural aspect and it meant to restrain women and deprive them of independence. “There is a need for different laws. An anti-honour killing law should be made to separately deal with this heinous crime. A separate commission or institution must be formed to deal with cases related to honour killings,” he said.

Anis Haroon, a former member of the National Commission for Human Rights, said the issue of honour killings was not a new issue. “Every other day we witness a new wave of honour killings,” she remarked. Citing the SHRC’s previous annual report, she stated that 118 cases of honour killings took place between 2017 and 2018.

She added that several cases of Karo-Kari also went unreported. “When dealing with the cases of honour killings, the judges and police are all under pressure,” she said.

Other speakers at the consultation included Chief Minister’s Special Assistant on Human Rights Veerji Kohli, Justice (retd) S Ali Aslam Jafri, Szabist Social Sciences Department Dean Dr Riaz Ahmed Shiakh, Aurat Foundation Resident Director Mahnaz Rahman and Federal Investigation Agency Additional Director Faizullah Korejo.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/713765-rape-cases-on-the-rise,,Rape cases on the rise,"LAHORE: While the Lahore police were literally running from pillar to post till the filing of this report to hunt down the two men who had allegedly raped a woman who was stranded on the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway with her children on Wednesday, the incidence of this heinous crime is surely surging--as is the case anywhere in the world--of course.

Exact figures are hence not available, but a January 12, 2016, statement of the incumbent Punjab Governor Chaudhry Sarwar had shed some light on rape

statistics pertaining to Punjab at least.

Chaudhary Sarwar had revealed: ""Pakistan is among the 10 worst countries when it comes to rape cases. Around 14,850 kidnapping cases involving women, children and girls have been reported in Punjab during the last one year. Around 10,000 rape cases were reported in Punjab during the last three and a half years, from January 2014 to June 2017. Some 2,000 women were kidnapped and 80pc of them were allegedly raped during last year, while 15 per cent of these were killed.

Chaudhary Sarwar was seemingly quite spot on because research conducted by the ‘Jang Group and Geo Television Network' shows 2,669 women in Punjab were raped during 2014, another 2,509 in 2015, some 2,938 in 2016 and 1,365 in 2017.

Research further shows that during 2019, not fewer than 3,881 cases of rape were registered in Punjab, or 581 cases more than what the case was the case in 2018.

The-then Additional Inspector General and the incumbent head of Punjab Police, Inam Ghani, was quoted by media as saying that civil society should play an active role to curb crimes instead of blaming the police.

It is imperative to note that a few years ago, famous international NGO Human Rights Watch had revealed that there while a rape incident occurred once every two hours in Pakistan, and a gang rape was mutilating the honour of a Pakistani woman every single hour.

Rape in Pakistan, which had gained global attention in 2003 after the politically sanctioned gang-rape of a woman Mukhtaran Bibi in the Muzaffargarh District as an ""honour rape"" after allegations that her 12-year-old brother had had sexual relations with a woman from a higher caste, remains a severely under-reported crime till date.

A May 12, 2020 report of the ‘Gulf News’ states: ""An alarming increase has been observed in cases of crime/ violence against women and children in Pakistan during the first quarter of 2020. A periodical report titled ""Tracking crimes against people - A numeric tale of human insecurity,"" which has been released by rights group ""Sustainable Social Development Organisation"" has revealed a 200 per cent increase in cases of violence against women in Pakistan in the past three months. The report, based on print media coverage of such incidents during the above-mentioned period, also shows the crime rate kept fluctuating during the period as 73 per cent drop was witnessed during the month of February but a spike of up to 360 per cent was witnessed during the month of March 2020.""

On April 17 this year, the American Department of State-led Overseas Security Advisory Council had produced a report in conjunction with the Regional Security Office at the US Consulate General in Lahore.

According to this report about rape incidents in Lahore, 101 such crimes were recorded and registered in 2017, there were 54 rapes in 2018 and 55 of such incidents had come to light in 2019.

In 2018, there were six gang rape incidents, dropping down to four in 2019.

Following this April 17, 2020, report, which had also highlighted carjacking numbers, assaults, armed robberies, home/shop invasions, theft of personal property and other violent crimes, the United States Department of State had assessed Lahore as being a ""High-Threat"" location.

Research further shows that by the end of February 2020, as many as 73 incidents of rape, including 5 gang-rape cases, were reported in Lahore.

As per the police record, 10 cases of gang rape were registered in 2019 while the number for the first two months of this year had rested at five.

Of the 10 cases registered last year, the police had arrested 28 accused after investigation.",['Sabir Shah'],"Chaudhary Sarwar had revealed: ""Pakistan is among the 10 worst countries when it comes to rape cases.

Arzoo Masih, 13, is said to have married a Muslim man, Syed Ali Azhar, 44, after converting to Islam. Police have arrested Azhar’s brothers, Syed Shariq Ali and Syed Mohsin Ali, and his friend Danish over their alleged involvement in the abduction and forced conversion.

On Thursday, the suspects moved their post-arrest bail applications before District South’s additional district and sessions judge Faiza Khalil, contending that they were innocent. Their attorney, Hidayat Ali Leghari, argued that the girl had already recorded her statement before the Sindh High Court, stating that she had accepted Islam out of her free will and had married Azhar without any fear or pressure.

He added that in view of the girl’s statement, the SHC had restrained the police from arresting Azhar and his family members. He asked the court to grant bail to his clients, all policemen. The judge, after listening to the arguments from the prosecutor as well, approved the bail applications and ordered the accused to submit sureties of Rs50,000 each with the court to secure their release.

According to the FIR, lodged by the girl’s father, Raja, Arzoo went missing on October 13 after which he approached the police to find her. Later, it transpired that she was in the custody of the suspects. The case was registered under section 364-A (kidnapping or abducting a person under the (age of fourteen) of the PPC at the Frere police station.

Earlier this week, a large number of Christian community members and civil society activists gathered outside the Karachi Press Club to protest against the incident, demanding of the government to make a law against the growing practice targeting religious minority girls.

They claimed that Arzoo was kidnapped and forced to marry her Muslim abductor in an area within the jurisdiction of the Frere police station. “We have proper evidence from Nadra that Arzoo is a 13-year-old who has been forced to be married to a 44-year-old man,” said Anthony Naveed, a minority MPA and leader of the PPP, who also attended the protest. The Sindh Assembly had passed the act in 2014, according to which the minimum age of marriage is 18 years and making a person younger than that age marry is a punishable offense.",['Our Correspondent'],"A court on Thursday granted bail to three men accused of abducting a teenage Christian girl and then forcibly converting her to Islam.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/564505-female-emergency,,Female emergency,"Rarely do women report cases of violence. They bear with consistent beating by their husbands and, sometimes, the in-laws as well.

Very few cases get reported, and yet the number of women reporting violence is said to have increased. Sometimes there is a bid to kill. Cases that reach the hospitals are the ones where violence was committed repeatedly. Nobody brings up a case at the very outset, say the doctors.

A doctor on duty at the Medico Legal department of Ganga Ram Hospital tells TNS, requesting anonymity, that she receives an average of six to seven cases (of violence against women) in a week. ""The ones that reach here are from police stations around the hospitals like Mozang, Civil Lines, Samanabad, Women Police Station Chauburji and Sabzazar; not from outside Lahore.

""Once the women leave the hospital they do not come back for a follow-up. Most cases are not pursued, maybe because of family pressure.""

At the Emergency of Mayo Hospital, a doctor speaks of receiving a case from outside Lahore, of a woman whose husband had axed her left leg, but did not elaborate.

When requested, the doctor shares some cases: ""Once, a woman came to us who had been battered by her husband as well as her younger sister-in-law. The latter intentionally poured steaming hot tea on her which burnt her skin. She would also heat a knife on the stove and cause burns on parts of her body. Even her private parts had been burnt.""

The doctor revealed that the woman had a five years old daughter. ""Will the child grow up to be a normal person, in such an environment?"" she asked.

""When she came to us, she hadn’t taken bath in more than a month, and was stinking. The police arrested the cruel sister-in-law on the complaint of the woman’s grandmother and an uncle.""

The doctor speaks of another young woman whose husband beat her almost every day, and after he was done his mother and sisters would start to hurt her. Her in-laws would lock her up in a room at times. She would lie there, all by herself. Once, when everybody in the house was out somewhere, she mustered the courage to cry for help. The neighbours heard her cries and screams, and they broke the lock and pulled her out. She was so scared that she ran for life barefoot.

Yet another woman who had been married for 20 years went to police and reported physical violence committed by her husband, a civil servant. What brought her to challenge the man was her 18 years old daughter who was witness to the savage behaviour of her father.

The hospital does not receive rape cases in time, the doctor warns. ""Only two out of a hundred [rape] cases reach us. For instance, there was a case in which a girl had eloped with a boy. When their relationship fell apart, the girl contacted her family who accused the boy of rape. The girl wanted divorce. At the same time, she reported she had been raped by her husband. This was confusing."" Pakistani law says nothing specific about marital rape but the Pakistan Penal Code section 375 in its comprehensive definition of rape classifies it as non-consensual sex forced upon any woman, making no mention of marital status. However, no case of marital rape has ever been registered in Pakistan.

She had been raised by a maternal uncle who made the arrangements for her wedding that was due to take place against her wishes. So, she ran away with all the dresses that had been prepared for her and her maternal cousin (mamu’s daughter). She also took away all the jewellery.

At the Mayo Hospital’s Medico Legal department, Dr Hammad, a young doctor on duty, says: ""Women do not go for parcha (FIR). It is when the family or neighbours push them that they gather courage to reach out to the police.""

He also talks about a woman who was beaten by her son. She lived with a fractured arm for a few months and did not report. Later, her son beat her up again and she got a head injury, which was when her neighbours intervened and brought her to the hospital. She received treatment but did not pursue the case.

Here is another case that he shares with TNS: A man admitted in the TB ward (of Mayo Hospital) expired. He had no attendants. In such a situation, the case is referred to the Medico Legal department of the hospital that searches for the deceased’s family for burial. So the department found an ID card in his shirt pocket and sent two men at the address given on it. This was somewhere in the old city. A woman opened the door. The team inquired if it was the deceased’s house, and the woman replied in negative and shut the door. They again looked at the address and confirmed if it was the same as written on the ID card. They again knocked at the door. Again, the same woman opened the door. The men repeated the question louder. Hearing them, someone in the house came forward and exclaimed, ""Mera puttar!"" (My son).

It transpired that the man had a wife who he used to beat up. One day he beat her so much that she fainted. There were only three people in the house at the time -- he, his wife, and his mother. He doused the fainted woman with oil and threw a lighted matchstick on her. She burnt to death. The family later said they often chided him for beating her, and would try to stop him but he wouldn’t listen. He told the police his mother had burnt his wife and the mother took the blame upon her and served seven years in jail. The family kicked him out for good and refused to own him even after his death.

At the Emergency of Mayo Hospital, a doctor speaks of receiving a case from outside Lahore, of a woman whose husband had axed her left leg, but did not elaborate.

TNS could not find any consolidated data on violence against women at the two hospitals it sought information from.

The plight of domestic servants is no better

Lawyers that take up criminal cases too have several stories of violence to share. Rai Haq Nawaz, Advocate, Lahore High Court, tells TNS a story of a domestic help from his village -- Chak No 198 EB, Vehari District.

Sumaira Bibi, a 14-year-old, was working at wadera Mumtaz Noor’s house. The domestic workers there are called ‘kammi/kameen’ or ‘musalli.’ The girl’s parents who had arranged for her marriage asked the employers to relieve her of her duty. The employers asked Sumaira’s parents to postpone the wedding for two years but the family refused and took her away. Enraged, one of the employers picked up the girl from her place and his wife, the lady of the house chopped her hair out of revenge. Her wedding was due on November 27; the parents lodged an FIR with the police on Nov 29.

""The labour class earn as low as Rs2,000 a month; they cannot bear any financial pressure, cannot pursue a case on their own,"" says the lawyer. ""This should be an uncompoundable offence but it is not so.""

In the same family, a girl who was Sumaira’s first cousin worked at a rich man’s house. They didn’t pay her for six months. They had a driver who they married her off to. She was found dead three days later. It could not be ascertained whether she had committed suicide or been killed by the driver. A case was never registered.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/453509-tackling-forced-conversions,,Tackling forced conversions,"How painful that Pakistan, founded by the great law-abiding Quaid-e-Azam, is now known as a country where abductions, child marriages and forced conversions are becoming a norm. Most alarming is that nobody dares to raise voice against this barbaric social evil, and stand with the poor victims.

The recent incident of two Hindu sisters, Reena and Raveena, has raised the sense of insecurity among our peace-loving non-Muslim community. The pain of the victimized family can only be felt by those who believe in humanity regardless of race, colour and religion.

First, the Pakistan Hindu Council tried to tackle the issue on its own for three days. But it failed. The council then proposed a five-point resolution and asked me to raise this issue at every possible and available forum like parliament, media and civil society etc.

I decided to table a resolution and two separate bills in the National Assembly for a permanent fix to this sensitive matter. I am grateful to minority parliamentarians from various political parties, including Lal Malhi (PTI), Dr Darshan (PML-N), Ms Shunila Ruth (PTI), and Ramesh Lal (PPPP), who – irrespective of their political affiliation – supported my resolution.

However, unfortunately rather than appreciating my sincere efforts towards a noble cause, some extremist elements are bust doing propaganda against me. A video clip is currently viral on social media in which some demonstrators, under the cover of religion, are publicly maligning me and my struggle.

In my view, all religions of the world are equally respectable. I highly respect the Prophet (pbuh) who laid the foundation of Madina, the first welfare state of the world. The Charter of Medina emphasized the rights of all citizens.

Whenever I visit Ajmer Sharif, I get the privilege to clean the floor of the shrine with my own hands. I regularly visits the shrines of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar and Shah Abdul Lateef Bhittai.

It is a universal fact that association to any religion is connected with the heart – and the human heart cannot be forced. History tells that if on the basis of power, we tried to impose something forcefully then at any time they can get back to their original place.

Regretfully, some misguided elements in our society are targeting minor Hindu girls, who even do not have a national identity card. When we do allow an under 18-years child to drive a car or even smoke then how come we allow minor immature girls take such important life decisions such as change of religion or marriage?

According to psychologists, the social status of women is severely affected after abduction. In most cases, they have no choice but to spend the rest of their lives with their kidnappers. Because they know the bitter fact that if they return then society will be reluctant to accept them. Such unfortunate women are spending a miserable life away from their blood relations.

This is the right time for serious legislation against forced conversion in Pakistan. For this purpose, it is also necessary to study the laws for religion conversion in different countries. In some countries, if someone wants to change religion then he/she has to file an application to the government for a notice of three months and then they also have to appear before a district magistrate about their conversion. In other countries, nobody is allowed to convert their religion before 18 years of age.

From the core of my heart, it is my sincere wish that all political parties must be on one page in enacting legislation to give a permanent end to all such shameful incidents. For the sake of humanity, all parliamentarians are requested to pass my tabled resolution unanimously. A parliamentary committee must also be formed to build a consensus on my bills. Two members from each political party, one Muslim and the other non-Muslim, must be members to give recommendations.

I am quite confident that if we opt for the right direction with good intention then the solution to every problem can be achieved.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/159760-PHC-acquits-seven-persons-named-in-forced-marriage-case,,PHC acquits seven persons named in forced marriage case,"All were charged under Elimination of Custom of Ghag Act

PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Monday acquitted seven persons of a family including nikah registrar of charges of using the custom of ‘Ghag’ to claim a girl.

‘Ghag’ is a centuries-old tradition whereby a man, without the consent of a girl or her parents, makes a declaration in public that a particular girl is engaged to him.

As a consequence, no other man dares to send a marriage proposal for the girl as it would earn him enmity of the person who made the ‘Ghag’ call. A two-member bench comprising Justice Waqar Ahmad Seth and Justice Musarrat Hilali acquitted the accused charged under Section 5 of the Elimination of Custom of Ghag Act 2013 after hearing arguments from both the parties and also the state lawyer.

The bench issued directives in a quashment petition filed by Gohar Ayub and other family members through their lawyer Amin Khattak. During hearing, the petitioners’ lawyer submitted before the bench that the police charged Gohar Ayub and his family members under Section 5 of Elimination of Custom of Ghag Act 2013 and sections 419 and 420 of Pakistan Penal Code in the first information report.

The lawyer said that Masil Khan, a resident of Mardan, had filed the FIR against Gohar Ayub and others for restraining him from giving the hand of his daughter Nasreen to Junaid Iqbal. He said the complainant claimed that Gohar Ayub through a fake nikahnama had claimed Nasreen to be his wife and used the ‘Ghag’ custom to claim the girl. The lawyer said it was a family court case and the police had wrongly charged the petitioners under the Ghag law. He said the case was pending with the family court that would decide and examine whether the nikahnama produced by Gohar Ayub was genuine or fake.

He noted that before registration of the FIR against the petitioner, Gohar Ayub had also lodged a complaint against Junaid Iqbal, who was going to perform nikah with the girl despite the fact that she was already in the nikah of the petitioner.

He said that nikah of the petitioner and the girl was properly performed and there were witnesses from both sides in the nikahnama. He said that signature of Maulvi Nazeer, a nikah registrar, was there in the nikahnama.

The lawyer argued that under the law the petitioners cannot be charged under the criminal law as the proper forum was the family court in this case. He said one accused Sohail was arrested in the case and the remaining six persons had got pre-arrest bail. Praying the court to quash the charges, he argued that the petitioners had been wrongly charged in the case.

On the other hand, the lawyer for the complainant and the state lawyer opposed the cancelation of the FIR against the accused. They argued that Gohar Ayub had got fake nikahnama to restrain the girl’s marriage with another person and thus they were rightly charged under the Ghag law.

Under the Elimination of Custom of Ghag Act 2013, whoever used ‘Ghag’ to ask for a girl’s hand in marriage will be punishable with imprisonment for a term no less than three years, which may also be extended to seven years. It also states that a fine of Rs0.5 million has to be paid by the offender.",['Akhtar Amin'],"The bench issued directives in a quashment petition filed by Gohar Ayub and other family members through their lawyer Amin Khattak.
