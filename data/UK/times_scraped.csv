The Guardian has launched a review of Roy Greenslade’s articles after it was accused of allowing him to question the credibility of a woman who accused an IRA member of raping her.

Greenslade, 74, resigned as a lecturer in journalism ethics at City University of London on Monday after confessing to supporting IRA violence.

The newspaper’s investigation follows a complaint from Máiría Cahill, a politician and member of a prominent republican family who waived anonymity to allege that she was raped by a senior IRA figure as a teenager.

Greenslade, a former Daily Mirror editor, wrote several articles on the Cahill case for The Guardian while employed as its media commentator.

We had seen her being beaten up and horribly humiliated by her ex-boyfriend’s vile girlfriend while he watched, egging her on. And Erin the mother of their baby. Deeply depressing.

Controversial fish news: an angler, Wayne Mansford, has caught Britain’s biggest carp (75lb 2oz), but has not claimed the record. Why? He’s worried “traditionalist” anglers wouldn’t accept the “imported” fish. Mirror carp are not native to the Cambridgeshire lake he caught it in.

As the Daily Mail sombrely reported, “This follows the fishy story of angler Tom Doherty who in 2016 received death threats for trying to claim the record for a 70lb mirror carp — imported from Israel.”

The German paedophile suspected of abducting Madeleine McCann is said to have been placed under surveillance in jail in the hope that he will confess to the notorious crime to a fellow prisoner.

The great thing about killing people is that you can do it anywhere. On a boat, in space, in a palace, on the old American wild frontier, in a medieval abbey with a massive library, wherever. So if the aim of your story is the place and the people, and they are all rich and granular and evocative and fascinating, but you STILL can’t think of any particular reason to actually be telling anybody about them, hey presto. Kill somebody. And suddenly, there’s a point.

★★★★

Conveying a strong sense of what life as a homeless drifter might feel like, Elizabeth Lo’s documentary might impress you even if you’re no great fan of its starring species: dogs. Shot in Istanbul, it tracks a dignified mongrel, Zeytin, and a few other mutts as they wander the streets. Their encounters with humans, including three young Syrian refugees, help to broaden the film’s scope, but so do other factors. Even when dogs are the only creatures on screen, the images are resonant.

Isabelle Trowler, 53, said social work needed “a reset” because it was “devastating” for families to have a child taken into care when they did not need to be.
She branded as “an injustice” the practice under which some authorities take away babies who could be safely supported at home.
SponsoredIn an interview Trowler said that dire warnings of a dramatic surge in children suffering neglect and being taken into care after the first lockdown had not come to pass.
Instead there had been a shift to “kinder” social work, which supported families rather than taking away their children.","['wrongly', 'away', 'isabelle', 'trowler', 'families', 'work', 'babies', 'children', 'worker', 'chief', 'supported', 'admits', 'taken', 'care', 'social']","{'https://www.thetimes.co.uk/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Fa81e969c-83f4-11eb-87b3-57c13ebd5dfe.jpg?crop=2667%2C1500%2C0%2C0&resize=685', 'https://www.thetimes.co.uk/d/assets/ipso-f7843bf2cd.png', 'https://www.thetimes.co.uk/d/assets/dual-masthead-bcc5303ae7.png', 'https://www.thetimes.co.uk/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Fa81e969c-83f4-11eb-87b3-57c13ebd5dfe.jpg?crop=2667%2C1500%2C0%2C0&resize=1180', 'https://www.thetimes.co.uk/d/img/logos/times-white-small-f4ad00a748.png'}",True,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Fsundaytimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Fa81e969c-83f4-11eb-87b3-57c13ebd5dfe.jpg?crop=2667%2C1500%2C0%2C0&resize=685,1,,,,,child abuse

His bestselling book The God Delusion had just been published and was receiving massive coverage just about everywhere. It was a no-holds- barred attack on religion, so we had a bit of a donnybrook. You can still find it on YouTube.

Dawkins rarely pulls his punches about anything. He has compared raising a child as Catholic with sexual abuse. Yes, really. He has described the Catholic Church as “a disgusting institution, the second most evil religion in the world”. The God of the Old Testament is a “genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully”, he reckons.

When children return to some schools on Monday they will see familiar faces in the makeshift testing bays — behind the masks of course. Former sixth-formers struggling to find jobs have been employed across schools at one academy trust to administer Covid tests to their old schoolmates.

It has the twofold impact of helping young people who are struggling during lockdown to earn money, and building trust among some suspicious communities that it is safe to be tested.

Corrin could also draw on her own trajectory as a 24-year-old actress. Before landing her part in The Crown, she was an unknown. Suddenly “there’s a huge amount of pressure”, she says.

A court in South Korea has ordered Japan to pay compensation to a group of former wartime sex slaves in a ruling that will worsen tensions between the neighbours.

The Japanese government reacted angrily to the order by the Seoul central district court to pay 100 million won (£67,000) to 12 “comfort women”, a handful of the hundreds of thousands who were forced into brothels for the Imperial Japanese Army. The court granted an order that makes it possible to seize Japanese government assets to cover the compensation award.

Japan refused to acknowledge the case, claiming that the courts of one country cannot claim jurisdiction over the government of another. It took no part in the proceedings.
